The Mahamuni Buddha image ( literal meaning : The Great Sage ) is deified in this temple , and originally came from Arakan . It is highly venerated in Burma and central to many people 's lives , as it is seen as an expression of representing the Buddha 's life . Ancient tradition refers to only five likenesses of the Buddha , made during his lifetime ; two were in India , two in paradise , and the fifth is the Mahamuni Buddha image in Myanmar . According to the legend , the Buddha visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC . King Sanda Thuriya requested that an image was cast of him . After casting the Great Image , the Buddha breathed upon it , and thereafter the image became the exact likeness of the Mahamuni . = = History = = = = = Origins = = = According to legend , the Gautama Buddha visited Dhanyawadi , the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a Proselytization mission to spread Buddhism . During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time , a devout Buddhist , the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town . The King of Arakan , along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala ( with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting ) , and an entourage of ministers , generals and officials , paid homage to the Buddha . They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi ( Sravasti ) , the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship . For this purpose , the Buddha then sat under a Bodhi tree for a week of meditation . During this time Sakka ( in P\u0101li , the ruler of the Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba Heaven in Buddhist cosmology , supported by his assistant Vissakamma , moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people . It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma ( or Vishvakarman ) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days . After looking at his own lifelike image , believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness , Buddha was pleased and \" imbued the image with his spiritual essence \" , or \" enlivened and consecrated \" the image , naming it \" Candasara \" . He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative . Historian Juliane Schober has very succinctly explained this legend and the cult worship that has evolved around the \" living \" double image of Mahamuni Buddha : The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha ... The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously : they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology , and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma . Theravada politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha 's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image . The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains . Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle relates to the nine phenomena that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed . These nine phenomena were : holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels ; the water from the tank that was used for washing the Buddha 's head would retain its quality throughout the year ; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings ; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers ; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees ; the leaves of trees would tilt in the direction of the Buddha image ; birds would not fly over the temple ; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple . Another legend narrated is linked to the six Khmer bronze statues ( three lions \u2013 with heads substituted later in Burmese style , a three-headed elephant known as Airavata , and two warriors in the form of Shiva ) , which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard . These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia . Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases . = = = Image history = = = In the ancient history of Arakan , King Anawratha of Pagan ( r . 1044 \u2013 1077 ) attempted to move the image to Pagan , without success . In 1784 , the Burmese under the military leadership of Crown Prince Thado Minsaw of Konbaung dynasty conquered the Kingdom of Mrauk U. The religious relics of the kingdom , including the Mahamuni Buddha image , were confiscated and installed in the Mahamuni temple or Pagoda at Amarapura , on the outskirts of the old capital of Mandalay . As the Mahamuni image was too large to transport as a whole , it was cut into sections and later reassembled and housed in the new temple . Mandalay became the capital under King Mindon ( r . 1853 \u2013 1878 ) . It was also the capital under his son Thibaw ( r . 1878 \u2013 1885 ) of the Konbaung Dynasty ( 1752 \u2013 1885 ) . When the British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to prevent the French from dominating it , monarchic rule ended . However , veneration of the Mahamuni image has continued , and is visited and idolised by many pilgrims , mainly Rakhine , Mon and Burmans peoples . Several old bronze statues that line the courtyard of the temple have a long history as war loot . They were originally Khmer statues , found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia , and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese . In 1564 , the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago ( Pegu ) . In 1599 , King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally , Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785 . According to local belief , many more of these statues were brought from Arakan . However , King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace . Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung brought from Siam , only six remain today , and are displayed in the temple complex . They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities . = = = Damage = = = The Mahamnuni image and its precincts suffered damage from fires in 1879 and 1884 . In the fire that broke out during the reign of King Thibaw , the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple , devotional halls , causeways and others were burnt down , although the Great Image itself was saved . Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the image . In 1887 , Minister Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung took charge of the site and in1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya . In 1996 , the military rulers in Burma undertook renovation work on the Mahamuni Pagoda . During this period , the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the belly of the Great Image . It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image . It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night , resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter . Whilst the meeting was in progress , attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl . A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all . It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired . However , the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all . = = Architecture = = = = = Main Temple \/ Pagoda = = = The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is a complex of structures located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest . It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King Bodawpaya to the eastern gate of the temple , although only remnants of this road can still be seen . A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the Thudhamma Nikaya ( order ) , is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda . The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn . The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks , selling religious paraphernalia such as incense , candles , rosaries , flowers , robes , sandals etc . , and various restaurants and tea shops . The sanctum sanctorum , where the large Mahamuni image is deified , is a small chamber and has a roof covering made up of seven pyatthat meaning tiered roofs ( derivative of the Sanskrit word prasada ) . The ceiling has an ornate mosaic covering . The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes . = = = Mahamuni image = = = The Mahamuni Buddha image is housed in a small chamber , seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the Bhumisparsa Mudra . This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha 's vanquishing of Mara ) . The legs are crossed with feet turned inwards , and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically , as a witness of his past deeds . The image is cast in bronze and weighs 6.5 tonnes and is erected on a 1.84 metres ( 6.0 ft ) high pedestal and reaches a height of 3.82 metres ( 12.5 ft ) . Its shoulders measure 1.84 metres ( 6.0 ft ) and its waist measures 2.9 metres ( 9.5 ft ) . It is draped in royal costumes with \" Brahmanic cords ( salwe ) and regalia crossing his chest \" . The image is crowned , bejewelled with diamonds , rubies and sapphires . The left hand appears imprecise , unusually large , and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm . Gold leaves are regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha by male devotees . Consequent to the frequent application of gold leaves , the coating of gold ( thickness 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) ) has given a shapeless contour to the Mahamuni image . However , it is also noted that the right hand , crown and other iconographic characteristics of royalty are free of gold leaf covering , which gives an impression that these were later additions to the original image of the Mahamuni . In 1884 , when the pagoda was burnt down , 91 kilograms ( 201 lb ) of gold was recovered from the site , which represents the continued historical veneration and perpetuation of the cult of Mahamuni . = = = Other features = = = A large number of ' inscription stones ' collected by King Bodawpaya are seen in a long gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard . These inscriptions , some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone , have been collected from many regions of the country . There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with rice cakes by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temple every day . Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum , which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia . = = Daily rituals = = On February 17 , 1988 , the present Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung initiated the ritual of daily face washing of the deity at dawn . This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4 : 30 am when monks wash the face and brush the teeth of the Buddha image . It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire , assisted by several lay helpers , dressed in white and wearing formal headdress . As soon as the drums are struck , the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels , offered by devotees . He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni 's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels . After this , sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water . After the ceremony is completed , the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines . On special occasions , such as Uposatha day , an orange stoll is placed around its shoulders by the presiding monk and is fanned . A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals ; some men sit in the front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer . Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed . During the winter season , the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order . During the reign of Burmese monarchs , offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way . Food and other offerings , sheltered by a Royal white umbrella , were taken in a procession from the palace , escorted by a Minister , as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state . = = Festival = = A major annual pagoda festival known as the ' Mahamuni Paya Pwe ' ( ' pwe ' meaning \" festival \" ) is held in early February , at the end of the Buddhist Lent to celebrate the history of the pagoda . During this festival , aside from the daily rituals , the Patthana from a \" Book of Conditional Relations \" is recited . This book is a philosophical text which Buddha recounted to his mother in a sermon in Tavatimsa heaven and is a sacred scripture in the Pali language . The Pattana recitation is a special feature , which continues for several days . Monks recite from the scriptures , in groups of two or three . The festivities also include various forms of entertainment programmes such as dance , music , theatre etc . , and there is also a social event , allowing families and friends gather to greet each other . Given that large crowds of pilgrims are attracted during the festive season , guards are posted near the Great Image and video cameras are placed in many parts of the temple precincts to protect it . = = Gallery = =",

The squadron became operational in September 1944 , and undertook ground attack missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre . Following the end of hostilities , No. 82 Squadron was re-equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs and deployed to Japan , where it formed part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . It remained there until October 1948 , when it was disbanded . = = History = = = = = World War II = = = During 1943 , the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) received 399 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft . Their arrival allowed the service to expand its combat force by forming five new Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons to join the three squadrons that had operated the type in the South West Pacific area since 1942 . No. 82 Squadron was formed at Bankstown , New South Wales , on 18 June 1943 . It was the third of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established , following No. 84 Squadron in February and No. 86 Squadron in March ; No. 78 Squadron was formed in July and No. 80 Squadron in September . Commanded by Squadron Leader Stanley Galton , No. 82 Squadron 's original complement was 279 , including fifteen officers . It was to have been equipped wholly with P-40M Kittyhawks but initially included a flight of Bell P-39 Airacobras . No. 82 Squadron conducted training at Bankstown until April 1944 , when personnel briefly moved to Hughes Airfield in the Northern Territory , before being redeployed to Townsville , Queensland , for further training . The squadron transferred to Port Moresby , New Guinea , at the end of August 1944 and then on to Noemfoor Island in mid-September , where it joined Nos. 76 and 77 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing under No. 10 Operational Group ( later the Australian First Tactical Air Force ) . Three of No. 82 Squadron 's Kittyhawks crashed due to engine trouble while staging through Nadzab and Tadji . Operating from Kamiri strip , the squadron flew its first combat mission on 30 September , bombing Samate airstrip with aircraft from No. 77 Squadron . On 18 October , one aircraft was lost to ground fire during an attack on Kai Island , while another was reported missing . No. 82 Squadron found it difficult to remain operational as most of its ground crew remained in Townsville until moving forward the following month ; in the meantime , the pilots took responsibility for arming and refuelling their aircraft . On 23 November , they dive bombed Japanese airfields on Halmahera with aircraft of No. 76 Squadron . No. 82 Squadron continued to conduct ground attack missions in New Guinea until March 1945 , when it relocated to Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) . From Morotai , the squadron conducted ground attack missions in the NEI and escorted Allied convoys carrying troops bound for the liberation of Borneo . The relegation of First Tactical Air Force to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale , culminating in the so-called \" Morotai Mutiny \" of April 1945 . Squadron Leader Bert Grace , commanding officer of No. 82 Squadron , was among eight senior pilots who tended their resignations in protest at what they saw as the waste of resources on targets of dubious military value . The officers were persuaded to continue on operations , and Grace oversaw the squadron 's move to Labuan island in June as part of Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of North Borneo . The Kittyhawks flew in support of Australian Army units until the end of the war . On one such mission on 8 August 1945 , No. 82 Squadron made a 900-mile ( 1,400 km ) round trip to attack targets around Kuching in Sarawak . During the first strike two Japanese aircraft were destroyed as they were taking off from the airstrip , while a transport was also destroyed and two more were damaged . The fighters then attacked several barges near Kuching Town and on the Sarawak River . Fourteen members of the squadron were killed on operations during the war . = = = Occupation of Japan = = = Shortly after the end of the war , No. 82 Squadron was selected to join the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12 September and 11 January 1946 , losing two aircraft to accidents in the process . The squadron deployed to Bofu , a former kamikaze base , during 13 \u2013 18 March 1946 , once again as part of No. 81 Wing with Nos. 76 and 77 Squadrons ; Nos. 381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support , respectively . No. 82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs , along with an escorting de Havilland Mosquito , in bad weather en route to Bofu , killing all crew members . From April 1946 , the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts . The Australians found that , far from offering resistance , the Japanese went out of their way to be accommodating . No. 82 Squadron 's commanding officer , Squadron Leader Graham Falconer , remarked following a dinner with Bofu 's mayor , \" I felt that we were being treated more as visitors than as an occupying force ! \" No. 81 Wing transferred to Iwakuni in April 1948 , the same month that the Federal government determined to reduce Australia 's contribution to BCOF . As part of this reduction , Nos. 76 and 82 Squadrons were slated for disbandment , leaving No. 77 Squadron as the sole RAAF fighter unit in the country . No. 82 Squadron conducted further training and exercises until September , and was disbanded at Iwakuni on 29 October 1948 .",

As part of this effort the Council of Ministers ordered the Ilyushin design bureau on 20 September 1947 to begin work on a glider capable of carrying 7,000 kg ( 15,000 lb ) of cargo , including 60 troops or a 122 mm ( 4.8 in ) cannon with its prime mover , ammunition and crew . Its intended tug was the Tupolev Tu-75 , a four-engined transport derived from the Tupolev Tu-4 . The Il-32 was an aluminum-bodied , high-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage whose fuselage was square in cross-section to fit as much cargo as possible . The two-spar wings had a moderate aspect ratio . It was regarded as expendable and was built very simply to facilitate large-scale manufacture .

During these flight tests it reached a cruising speed of 323 km \/ h ( 201 mph ) at an altitude of 3,000 metres ( 9,800 ft ) and a weight of 16,000 kg ( 35,000 lb ) .

The most important system this year was Hurricane Ava , which was the most intense Pacific hurricane known at the time . Several other much weaker tropical cyclones came close to , or made landfall on , the Pacific coast of Mexico . The most serious of these was Hurricane Irah , which downed power and communication lines in parts of the Baja California Peninsula ; the other landfalling storms caused rain and some flooding . No tropical cyclone this season caused any deaths . This season had a quick start but a slow end . Overall activity was below average , with twelve named systems in total . Of these , five were tropical storms , seven were hurricanes , of which three were major ( Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale ) . Just one storm formed in August , one of the least active Augusts ever in the east Pacific . The season officially started May 15 , 1973 in the eastern Pacific , and June 1 , 1973 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1973 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern north Pacific Ocean , often off the coast of Mexico . As is usual in the northern hemisphere , most traveled generally westward or northwestward , and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands . = = Season summary = = The season began with the formation of the pre-Ava tropical depression on June 2 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Lillian on October 9 . The season lasted a total of 129 days . No named storms formed in May , three in June , four in July , one in August , three in September , one in October , and none in November . Another six tropical depressions formed during the year , but data on them is unavailable . All of these tropical cyclones formed in the eastern north Pacific tropical cyclone basin , which encompasses the Pacific Ocean north of the equator east of 140 \u00b0 W. None formed in the central north Pacific , which is the remainder of the Pacific Ocean east of the international dateline . Of the tropical cyclones that formed this year , were twelve tropical storms and seven were hurricanes . Of those hurricanes , three of them were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale . These totals are all below the long-term averages of thirteen tropical storms , nine hurricanes , and four major hurricanes . At the time , this season 's total of twelve named tropical cyclones was exactly average , although at the time the climatology in this basin was weak because satellite coverage was spotty before 1966 . This season , all advisories and tropical cyclone data were released and collected by two agencies , the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City , California , and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu , Hawaii , both of which were coextensive with the National Weather Service Forecast Offices in their respective cities . The EPHC covered the area between the coast of North America and 140 \u00b0 W , and the CPHC the remainder of the area . = = = Hurricane Ava = = = A tropical depression formed on June 2 . It steadily strengthened and headed in a generally westerly direction . It moved slowly and became Hurricane Ava on June 4 . Two days later , it became a major hurricane and it sped up . On June 7 , it became a Category 5 hurricane . It then started weakening and slowed down until it dissipated on June 12 . No deaths or damages were attributed to Hurricane Ava . Ava 's minimum central pressure was 915 millibars , and its maximum sustained winds reached 140 knots ( 260 km \/ h ) . This made Ava the most intense recorded east Pacific hurricane at the time . Ava reached Category 5 intensity on June 7 , the earliest date in an east Pacific season that a hurricane has done so . It was also the second known Category 5 storm in the east Pacific ; ( behind Patsy in 1959 ) . Ava is the strongest June storm , the fifth most intense east Pacific hurricane , and was the only June Category 5 on record until 2010 . Ava was also flown into by hurricane hunter aircraft in what was the first penetration of a Pacific hurricane by NOAA aircraft . During these flights , radars and other devices were tested , and wind speed , pressure , and wave heights were measured . This is the reason why Hurricane Ava 's pressure is measured instead of estimated . Ava was also photographed from Skylab because it was visible during one of the missions . At that time , it was coincidentally on the surface of the Earth directly underneath the space station . All in all , these made Hurricane Ava one of the best-observed Pacific hurricanes at the time . = = = Tropical Storm Bernice = = = A nearly stationary disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone spent three days organizing and finally developed into a tropical depression on June 22 . The cyclone started heading northwest . After intensifying into a tropical storm , Bernice made landfall on June 23 at a location roughly 50 mi ( 80 km ) southwest of Zihuatanejo . It dissipated later that day . Bernice exposed two ships to gales , but otherwise neither deaths nor significant impact was reported . At its peak , Tropical Storm Bernice had winds of 70 miles per hour ( 110 km \/ h ) . = = = Tropical Storm Claudia = = = A tropical depression formed June 26 from a westward-moving area of disturbed weather . The next day , it developed gale-force winds and was named Claudia . Claudia headed northwesterly and then northwards and made landfall on June 28 approximately 30 mi ( 50 km ) east of Acapulco . It dissipated inland the next day . No deaths or casualties were reported due to this tropical cyclone . = = = Hurricane Doreen = = = On July 18 , a tropical storm formed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and was named Doreen . It steadily intensified , and became a hurricane on July 19 . Doreen briefly reached Category 4 strength on July 21 with a relatively high central pressure of 972 mb ( 28.7 inHg ) . It then weakened steadily as its path carried it on a direct path to the Big Island of Hawaii . Doreen weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility on July 25 . A frontal system stuck between two high-pressure areas weakened as the two areas merged , creating a larger high pressure area that turned Doreen to the southwest on July 27 . The hurricane then turned back to the northwest and strengthened back into a hurricane . It became a major hurricane again before weakening . Doreen dissipated August 3 . Its remnant vortex continued westward until it dissipated under a trough near the dateline . Doreen 's sudden change of track and restrengthening was unusual . From formation to dissipation , Doreen lasted 16.25 days and traveled a distance of 4,200 mi ( 6,760 km ) . This tied Hurricane Celeste 's record for longest-lasting Pacific hurricane . Doreen was also the longest-lasting July tropical cyclone . Hurricane Fico broke both of these records in the 1978 season . Doreen remains the eighth-longest lasting Pacific tropical cyclone , tied with two other storms . Several ships encountered Doreen . The most serious incident involved a Greek ship called Cornelia which lost its rudder in 35 ft ( 10 m ) waves , but managed to escape and continue on its way to Panama . On the afternoon of July 29 , 9 ft ( 2.7 m ) swells and 3.5 ft ( 0 m ) waves were seen from Kapoho . Otherwise , no damages or deaths were blamed on this tropical cyclone . = = = Hurricane Emily = = = A depression formed July 21 from squalls in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and headed west-northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm . Emily continued moving nearly parallel to the coast before turning to the west while steadily intensifying . Emily eventually reached Category 4 intensity on July 22 . Emily then weakened as it turned to the northwest . It dissipated on July 28 . Emily 's wind field was large enough to bring gales areas 300 mi ( 480 km ) east of the hurricane from July 22 to 24 . This tropical cyclone caused no deaths or damage . = = = Hurricane Florence = = = On July 25 , a depression formed off the coast of Guatemala . The storm made a close approach to the Mexican coast as a depression , but did not make landfall . Just after that , it strengthened into a tropical storm . Florence headed west and then west-northwest . It became a hurricane on July 29 . It began weakening thereafter . Florence dissipated on July 30 . No damages or deaths were reported . = = = Tropical Storm Glenda = = = A depression that had formed on July 30 from a tropical disturbance quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Glenda . It took a path similar to both Florence and Emily , but further from the shore . Glenda dissipated August 5 . At the time it still had winds of 40 knots ( 70 km \/ h ) , down from its peak of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km \/ h ) . No deaths , damage , or other impact was reported . = = = Tropical Storm Heather = = = The only storm to form in August this year formed on August 31 from an area of circulation in the ITCZ over the Gulf of Tehuantepec . It became a tropical depression on August 30 . After moving northwest for a bit , it became a tropical storm and headed almost due north towards Mexico . Heather dissipated September 1 , just before making landfall . Tropical Storm Heather caused no deaths or damage to any location in the coastal area of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . = = = Hurricane Irah = = = A depression formed September 22 . It became a tropical storm on September 23 and a hurricane on September 24 . Irah took a northwesterly path and reached Category 2 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale , and then dropped back down to a 1 as it recurved . It made landfall on Baja California and entered the Gulf of California as a tropical storm , making landfall again in northwestern Mexico approximately 30 mi ( 50 km ) northwest of Los Mochis . Irah 's first landfall was the strongest of the season . The hurricane dissipated on September 27 while heading east-northeast over mainland Mexico . Irah blew over some power and communication lines during its passage over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . Heavy rain fell over parts of Mexico , with the highest total being 10.24 in ( 260 mm ) at Sierra de la Laguna . One person was injured and at least ten houses were destroyed in Cabo San Lucas . No one was killed . There was some concern that the hurricane could disrupt splashdown procedures for astronauts at the end of Skylab 3 ; however , the return to Earth was not seriously affected . = = = Tropical Storm Jennifer = = = On September 23 , another depression formed . It took a northeasterly path , rotating around the southern periphery of Hurricane Irah as part of a Fujiwara interaction . It strengthened into a tropical storm late on September 24 . The peak windspeed of this tropical cyclone was 40 miles per hour ( 60 km \/ h ) . Jennifer then weakened to a depression and turned to the north-northeast . Jennifer brushed the Islas Mar\u00edas . The cyclone made landfall near just southeast of Mazatl\u00e1n and dissipated September 27 . Tropical Depression Jennifer caused rain over several parts of Mexico . The highest total was 7.48 in ( 190 mm ) at Navarette \/ San Blas . No one was killed and no damage was reported . = = = Hurricane Katherine = = = Katherine became a tropical storm on September 29 , just six hours after forming . It headed out to sea . On October 1 , it became a hurricane . It peaked in windspeed the next day . After weakening to storm strength , it crossed 140 \u00b0 W and entered the central Pacific . Katherine continued its slightly south of westward track . It dropped to a depression on October 9 , and dissipated shortly after that due to the influence of a cold trough . The storm never threatened land , causing no casualties or damage . = = = Hurricane Lillian = = = A depression that formed October 5 reached storm strength the same day . It generally paralleled the coast of Mexico far offshore . Lillian reached minimal hurricane strength on October 7 and peaked the next day . The hurricane began to weaken immediately thereafter and dissipated on October 9 . Through its life , Lillian at first traveled generally west-northwestward , and then westward . Lillian never threatened land , causing no known impact . = = 1973 Storm Names = = These names were used for storms that formed in the eastern Pacific during this season . It is the same list used in the 1969 season . Storms were named Katherine and Lillian for the first time this year . No names were retired , so this list was used again in the 1977 season . Names that weren 't assigned are colored gray . The Central Pacific used names and numbers from the Western Pacific 's typhoon list . No systems formed in the area , and thus no names were required .",

The most important system this year was Hurricane Ava, which was the most intense Pacific hurricane known at the time. Several other much weaker tropical cyclones came close to, or made landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico. The most serious of these was Hurricane Irah, which downed power and communication lines in parts of the Baja California Peninsula ; the other landfalling storms caused rain and some flooding. No tropical cyclone this season caused any deaths."

        "doc": "Cary Grant = Cary Grant ( born Archibald Alexander Leach ; January 18 , 1904 \u2013 November 29 , 1986 ) was a British-American actor , known as one of classic Hollywood 's definitive leading men . He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s , and became known for his transatlantic accent , light-hearted approach to acting and comic timing , and debonair demeanor . He became an American citizen in 1942 . Born in Horfield , Bristol , Grant became attracted to theatre at a young age , and began performing with a troupe known as \" The Penders \" from the age of six . After attending Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol , he toured the country as a stage performer , and decided to stay in New York City after a performance there . He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s . He initially appeared in crime films or dramas such as Blonde Venus ( 1932 ) and She Done Him Wrong ( 1933 ) , but later gained renown for his appearances in romantic comedy and screwball comedy films such as The Awful Truth ( 1937 ) , Bringing Up Baby ( 1938 ) , His Girl Friday ( 1940 ) , The Philadelphia Story ( 1940 ) . Along with the later Arsenic and Old Lace ( 1944 ) and I Was a Male War Bride ( 1949 ) ; these films are frequently cited as among the all-time great comedy films . Having established himself as a major Hollywood star , he was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor , for Penny Serenade ( 1941 ) and None but the Lonely Heart ( 1944 ) . In the 1940s and 1950s , Grant forged a working relationship with the director Alfred Hitchcock , appearing in films such as Suspicion ( 1941 ) , Notorious ( 1946 ) , To Catch a Thief ( 1955 ) and North by Northwest ( 1959 ) . Hitchcock considered Grant to have been the only actor that he had ever loved . Towards the end of his film career , Grant was praised by critics as a romantic leading man , and received five Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nominations , including Indiscreet ( 1958 ) with Ingrid Bergman , That Touch of Mink ( 1962 ) with Doris Day , and Charade ( 1963 ) with Audrey Hepburn . He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal , as a handsome , suave actor who did not take himself too seriously , possessing the ability to play with his own dignity in comedies without sacrificing it entirely . His comic timing and delivery made Grant what Premiere considers to have been \" quite simply , the funniest actor cinema has ever produced \" . Grant was married five times ; three of his marriages were elopements with actresses \u2014 Virginia Cherrill ( 1934 \u2013 35 ) , Betsy Drake ( 1949 \u2013 62 ) and Dyan Cannon ( 1965 \u2013 68 ) . He has one daughter with Cannon , Jennifer Grant ( born 1966 ) . After his retirement from film acting in 1966 , Grant pursued numerous business interests , representing cosmetics firm Faberg\u00e9 , and sitting on the board of MGM and others . He was presented with an Honorary Oscar by his friend Frank Sinatra at the 42nd Academy Awards in 1970 , and in 1981 , he was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors . In 1999 , the American Film Institute named Grant the second greatest male star of Golden Age Hollywood cinema , after Humphrey Bogart . = = Early life and education = = Grant was born Archibald Leach on January 18 , 1904 at 15 Hughenden Road in the northern Bristol suburb of Horfield . He was the second child of Elias James Leach ( 1873 \u2013 1935 ) and Elsie Maria Leach ( n\u00e9e Kingdon ; 1877 \u2013 1973 ) . Elias , the son of a potter , worked as a tailor 's presser at a clothes factory , while Elsie , who was from a family of shipwrights , worked as a seamstress . Grant 's elder brother , John William Elias Leach ( 1899 \u2013 1900 ) , died of tuberculous meningitis . Grant considered himself to have been partly Jewish . He had an unhappy upbringing ; his father was an alcoholic , and his mother suffered from clinical depression . Wanting the best for her son , Elsie taught Grant song and dance when he was four , and was keen on him having piano lessons . She would occasionally take him to the cinema where he enjoyed the performances of Charlie Chaplin , Chester Conklin , Fatty Arbuckle , Ford Sterling , Mack Swain and Broncho Billy Anderson . Grant entered education when he was four-and-a-half and was sent to the Bishop Road Primary School , Bristol . Grant 's biographer Graham McCann mentions that Maureen Donaldson , a lover of Grant in the 1970s , claimed in her book that his mother \" did not know how to give affection and did not know how to receive it either . \" Another biographer , Geoffrey Wansell , notes that Elsie blamed herself bitterly for the death of Grant 's older brother John , and never recovered from it . Grant later acknowledged that his negative experiences with his fiercely independent mother affected his relationships with women later in life . She frowned on alcohol and tobacco , and would reduce pocket money for minor mishaps . Grant later attributed her behavior towards him as down to her being overprotective , fearing that she would lose him as she did John . Grant 's father later placed his mother in Glenside Hospital ( a mental institution ) and told the 9-year-old that she had gone away on a \" long holiday \" , later declaring that she had died . Grant grew up resenting his mother , particularly after she left the family . After Elsie was gone , Grant and his father moved into the home of his grandmother in Bristol . When Grant was 10 , his father remarried and started a new family that did not include his son . Grant did not learn that his mother was still alive until he was 31 , when his father confessed to the lie , shortly before his own death . Grant made arrangements for his mother to leave the institution in June 1935 , shortly after he learned of her whereabouts . He visited her during a break to England in October 1938 , after filming for Gunga Din was completed . Due to alienation from his parents , he found it difficult to socialize and had a nervous disposition . He enjoyed the theatre , particularly pantomimes at Christmas which he would attend with his father . Grant befriended a troupe of acrobatic dancers , known as \" The Penders \" or the \" Bob Pender Stage Troupe \" . He subsequently trained as a stilt walker and began touring with them . During a two-week stint at the Wintergarten theatre in Berlin circa 1914 he was noticed by Jesse Lasky , who was a Broadway producer at the time . In 1915 , Grant won a scholarship to attend Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol , although his father could barely afford to pay for the uniform . With his good looks and acrobatic talents Grant became a popular figure among both girls and boys . Though he was able at most academic subjects He excelled at sports , particularly fives , and developed a reputation for mischief ; he frequently refused to do his homework . A former classmate referred to him as a \" scruffy little boy \" , while an old teacher remembered \" the naughty little boy who was always making a noise in the back row and would never do his homework \" . His evenings were spent working backstage in Bristol theatres , and in 1917 , at the age of 13 , he was responsible for the lighting for the magician David Devant at the Hippodrome . Grant began hanging around backstage at the theatre at every opportunity . In the summer he volunteered for work as a messenger boy and guide at the military docks in Southampton , to escape the unhappiness of his home life . The time spent at Southampton strengthened his desire to travel ; he was eager to leave Bristol and tried to sign on as a ship 's cabin boy , but learned he was too young . On March 13 , 1918 , Grant was expelled from Fairfield . Several explanations were given , including being discovered in the girls ' lavatory , and assisting two other classmates with theft in the nearby town of Almondsbury . Wansell claims that Grant had set out to intentionally get himself expelled from school to pursue a career in entertainment with the troupe . Grant rejoined Pender 's troupe three days after being expelled from Fairfield . Elias now had a better paying job in Southampton ; Grant 's expulsion from the school brought local authorities to his door with questions about why his son was living in Bristol and not with his father in Southampton . Upon learning that his son was once again with the Pender troupe , Elias co-signed a three-year contract between his son and Pender . The contract stipulated Grant 's weekly salary along with room and board , as well as dancing lessons and other training for his profession until the age of 18 . There was also a provision in the contract for salary rises based on job performance . = = Vaudeville and performing career = = Without school to attend , Grant rejoined the Pender Troupe , and accepted a salary of 10 shillings a week from Pender . The group began touring the county , and Grant developed the ability in pantomime to broaden his physical acting skills . On July 21 , 1920 , at the age 16 , Grant travelled with the group on the RMS Olympic to conduct a tour of the United States , arriving a week later . Biographer Richard Schickel claims that Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were aboard the same ship , returning from their honeymoon , and that Grant played shuffleboard with him . He was so impressed with Fairbanks that the actor became an important role model . After arriving in New York , the group performed at the New York Hippodrome \u2014 the largest theatre in the world at the time with a capacity of 5,697 \u2014 for nine months , putting on twelve shows a week ; their production of Good Times was successful . Grant became a part of the vaudeville circuit and began touring . After performing in places such as St. Louis , Missouri , Cleveland and Milwaukee , he made the decision to stay in the US with several of the other members , while the rest of the troupe returned to Britain . He remembered becoming fond of the performances of the Marx Brothers during this period and Zeppo Marx was an early role model for him . In July 1922 , Grant performed in a group with seven others , the \" Knockabout Comedians \" , at the Palace Theatre on Broadway . He formed a group that summer , \" The Walking Stanleys \" , with several of the former members of the Pender Troupe , and starred in a variety show named \" Better Times \" at the Hippodrome towards the end of the year . After meeting George C. Tilyou , the owner of the Steeplechase Park racecourse on Coney Island at a party , Grant was hired to appear there on stilts and attracted large crowds , wearing a bright-great coat and a sandwich board which advertised the race-track . Grant spent the next couple of years touring the United States with \" The Walking Stanleys \" . He visited Los Angeles for the first time in 1924 , which left a lasting impression upon him . After the group split up he returned to New York , where he began living and performing at the National Vaudeville Artists Club on West 46th Street , juggling , performing acrobatics and comic sketches and having a short spell as a unicycle rider known as \" Rubber Legs \" . The experience was a particularly demanding one , but gave Grant the opportunity to improve his comic technique and develop skills which would benefit him later in Hollywood . Grant became a leading man alongside Jean Dalrymple , and decided to form the \" Jack Janis Company \" , which began touring vaudeville . He was sometimes mistaken for an Australian during this period , and was nicknamed \" Kangaroo \" or \" Boomerang \" . Grant 's accent seems to have changed as a result of moving to London with the Pender troupe and working in many music halls in the UK and the US , eventually becoming what some term a transatlantic or mid-Atlantic accent . In 1927 he was cast as an Australian in Reggie Hammerstein 's musical , Golden Dawn , for which he earned $ 75 a week . Although the show was not well received , it lasted for 184 performances , and several critics started to notice the \" pleasant new juvenile \" or \" competent young newcomer \" . The following year he joined the William Morris Agency and was offered another juvenile part by Hammerstein , in his play Polly , an unsuccessful production . One critic wrote that Grant \" has a strong masculine manner , but unfortunately fails to bring out the beauty of the score . \" Wansell notes that the pressure of a failing production began to make him fret , and he was eventually dropped from the run after six weeks of poor reviews . Despite the set back , Hammerstein 's rival Florenz Ziegfeld made an attempt to buy Grant 's contract , but Hammerstein sold it to the Shubert Brothers instead . J. J. Shubert cast him in a small role as a Spaniard opposite Jeanette MacDonald in the French risqu\u00e9 comedy production of Boom-Boom at the Casino Theatre on Broadway , which premiered on January 28 , 1929 . MacDonald later admitted that he was \" absolutely terrible in the role \" , but exhibited a charm which endeared him to people and effectively saved the show from failure . The play ran for 72 shows , and Grant earned $ 350 a week before moving to Detroit , then Chicago . To console himself , Grant bought a 1927 Packard sport phaeton . He visited his half-brother , Eric , in England , and upon returning to New York later in the year , he played the role of Max Grunewald in a Shubert production of A Wonderful Night . It premiered at the Majestic Theatre on October 31 , 1929 , two days after the Wall Street Crash , and lasted for 125 shows until February 1930 . The play received mixed reviews ; one critic criticized his acting , likening it to a \" mixture of John Barrymore and cockney \" , while another announced that he had brought a \" breath of elfin Broadway \" to the role . Though he began to gain recognition , Grant still found it difficult forming relationships with women , remarking that \" In all those years in the theatre , on the road and in New York , surrounded by all sorts of attractive girls , I never seemed able to fully communicate with them . \" In 1930 , Grant toured for nine months in a production of the musical , The Street Singer . After the production came to end in the spring of 1931 , the Shuberts invited him to spend the summer performing on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis , Missouri ; he appeared in twelve different productions , putting on 87 shows . He received praise from local newspapers for these performances , gaining a reputation as a romantic leading man . Significant influences on his acting in this period were Sir Gerald du Maurier , A. E. Matthews , Jack Buchanan and Ronald Squire . He later admitted that he was drawn to acting because of a \" great need to be liked and admired \" . Grant was eventually fired by the Shuberts at the end of the summer season when he refused to accept a pay cut because of financial difficulties caused by the Depression . His unemployment was short lived ; impresario William B. Friedlander offered him the lead romantic part in his new musical , Nikki , in which Grant starred opposite Fay Wray as a soldier in post-World War I France . The production opened on September 29 , 1931 in New York , but was stopped after just 39 performances due to the effects of the Depression . = = Film career = = = = = Early roles ( 1932 \u2013 36 ) = = = Grant 's role in Nikki was praised by Ed Sullivan of The New York Daily News , who noted that the \" young lad from England \" had \" a big future in the movies \" . The review led to another screen test by Paramount Publix , resulting in appearance as a sailor in Singapore Sue ( 1932 ) , a ten-minute short film by Casey Robinson . Grant delivers his lines \" without any conviction \" according to McCann . Through Robinson , Grant met with Jesse L. Lasky and B. P. Schulberg , the co-founder and general manager of Paramount Pictures respectively . After a successful screen-test directed by Marion Gering . Schulberg signed a contract with the 27-year-old Grant on December 7 , 1931 for five years , at a starting salary of $ 450 a week . Schulberg demanded that he change his name to \" something that sounded more all-American like Gary Cooper \" , and they eventually agreed on Cary Grant . Cary Grant set out to establish himself as what McCann calls the \" epitome of masculine glamour \" , and made Douglas Fairbanks his first role model . McCann notes that Grant 's career in Hollywood immediately took off because he exhibited a \" genuine charm \" , which made him stand out among the other good looking actors at the time , making it \" remarkably easy to find people who were willing to support his embryonic career \" . He made his feature film debut with the Frank Tuttle-directed comedy This is the Night ( 1932 ) , playing an Olympic javelin thrower opposite Thelma Todd and Lili Damita . Grant disliked his role and threatened to leave Hollywood , but to his surprise a critic from Variety praised his performance , and thought that he looked like a \" potential femme rave \" . In 1932 Grant played a wealthy playboy opposite Marlene Dietrich in Blonde Venus , directed by Josef von Sternberg . Grant 's role is described by William Rothman as projecting the \" distinctive kind of nonmacho masculinity that was to enable him to incarnate a man capable of being a romantic hero \" . Grant found that he conflicted with the director during the filming and the two often argued in German . He played a suave playboy type in a number of films : Merrily We Go to Hell opposite Frederic March and Sylvia Sidney , Devil and the Deep alongside Gary Cooper , Charles Laughton and Tallulah Bankhead , Hot Saturday opposite Nancy Carroll and Randolph Scott , and Madame Butterfly with Sidney . According to biographer Marc Eliot , while these films did not make Grant a star , they did well enough to establish him as one of Hollywood 's \" new crop of fast-rising actors \" . In 1933 , Grant gained attention for appearing in the pre-Code films She Done Him Wrong and I 'm No Angel opposite Mae West . West would later claim that she had discovered Cary Grant . Pauline Kael noted that Grant did not appear confident in his role as a Salvation Army director in She Done Him Wrong , which made it all the more charming . The film was a box office hit , earning more than $ 2 million in the United States , and has since won much acclaim . For I 'm No Angel , Grant 's salary was increased from $ 450 to $ 750 a week . The film was even more successful than She Done Him Wrong , and saved Paramount from bankruptcy ; Vermilye cites it as one of the best comedy films of the 1930s . After a string of financially unsuccessful films , which included roles as a president of a company who is sued for knocking down a boy in an accident in Born to Be Bad ( 1934 ) for 20th Century Fox , a cosmetic surgeon in Kiss and Make-Up ( 1934 ) , and a blinded pilot opposite Myrna Loy in Wings in the Dark ( 1935 ) , successive poor box office takings and press reports of his fledging marriage to Cherrill , led Paramount to form the conclusion that Grant was now expendable . Grant 's prospects picked up in the latter half of 1935 when was loaned to RKO Pictures . Producer Pandro Berman agreed to take him on in the face of failure because \" I 'd seen him do things which were excellent , and [ Katharine ] Hepburn wanted him too . \" For his first venture with RKO , playing a raffish cockney swindler in George Cukor 's Sylvia Scarlett ( 1935 ) , he began the first of four collaborations with Hepburn . Though a commercial failure , his dominating performance was praised by critics , and Grant always considered the film to have been the breakthrough for his career . When his contract with Paramount ended in 1936 with the release of Wedding Present , Grant decided not to renew it and wished to work freelance . Grant claimed to be the first freelance actor in Hollywood and the lack of central contract helped increase his salary to $ 300,000 per picture . His first venture as a freelance actor was The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss ( 1936 ) , which was shot in England . The film was a box office bomb and prompted Grant to reconsider his decision . Critical and commercial success with Suzy later that year in which he played a French airman opposite Jean Harlow and Franchot Tone , led to him signing joint contracts with RKO and Columbia Pictures , enabling him to choose the stories that he felt suited his acting style . His Columbia contract was a four-film deal over two years , guaranteeing him $ 50,000 each for the first two and $ 75,000 each for the others . = = = Hollywood stardom and Oscar recognition ( 1937 \u2013 44 ) = = = In 1937 , Grant began the first film under his contract with Columbia Pictures , When You 're in Love , portraying a wealthy American artist who eventually woos a famous opera singer ( Grace Moore ) . His performance received positive feedback from critics , with Mae Tinee of The Chicago Daily Tribune describing it as the \" best thing he 's done in a long time \" . After a commercial failure in his first RKO venture The Toast of New York , Grant was loaned to Hal Roach 's studio for Topper , a screwball comedy film distributed by MGM , which became his first major comedy success . Grant played one half of a wealthy , freewheeling married couple with Constance Bennett , who wreak havoc on the world as ghosts after dying in a car accident . Topper became one of the most popular movies of the year , with a critic from Variety noting that both Grant and Bennett \" do their assignments with great skill \" . Vermilye described the film 's success as \" a logical springboard \" for Grant to star in The Awful Truth that year , his first film made with Irene Dunne and Ralph Bellamy . Though McCarey reportedly disliked Grant , who had mocked the director by enacting his mannerisms in the film , he recognized Grant 's comic talents and encouraged him to improvize his lines and draw upon his skills developed in vaudeville . The film was a critical and commercial success and made Grant a top Hollywood star , establishing a screen persona for him as a sophisticated light comedy leading man in screwball comedies . The Awful Truth began what film critic Benjamin Schwarz of The Atlantic later called \" the most spectacular run ever for an actor in American pictures \" for Grant . In 1938 he starred opposite Katharine Hepburn in the screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby , featuring a leopard and frequent bickering and verbal jousting between Grant and Hepburn . He was initially uncertain how to play his character , but was told by director Howard Hawks to think of Harold Lloyd . Grant was given more leeway in the comic scenes , the editing of the film and in educating Hepburn in the art of comedy . Despite losing over $ 350,000 for RKO , the film earned rave reviews from critics . He again appeared with Hepburn in the romantic comedy Holiday later that year , which did not fare well commercially , to the point that Hepburn was considered to be \" box office poison \" at the time . Despite a series of commercial failures , Grant was now more popular than ever and in high demand . According to Vermilye , in 1939 Grant played roles that were more dramatic , albeit with comical undertones . He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film Gunga Din , set at a military station in India . Roles as a pilot opposite Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth in Hawks 's Only Angels Have Wings , and a wealthy landowner alongside Carole Lombard in In Name Only followed . In 1940 , Grant played a callous newspaper editor who learns that his ex-wife and former journalist , played by Rosalind Russell , is to marry an insurance officer in the comedy His Girl Friday , which was praised for its strong chemistry and \" great verbal athleticism \" between Grant and Russell . Grant reunited with Irene Dunne in My Favorite Wife , a \" first rate comedy \" according to Life magazine , which became RKO 's second biggest picture of the year , with profits of $ 505,000 . After playing a Virginian backwoodsman in the American Revolution-set The Howards of Virginia , which McCann considers to have been Grant 's worst film and performance , his last film of the year was in the critically lauded romantic comedy The Philadelphia Story , in which he played the ex-husband of Hepburn 's character . Grant felt his performance was so strong that he was bitterly disappointed not to have received an Oscar nomination , and joked \" I 'd have to blacken my teeth first before the Academy will take me seriously \" . The following year Grant was considered for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Penny Serenade \u2014 his first nomination from the academy . Wansell claims that Grant found the film to be an emotional experience , because he and wife-to-be Barbara Hutton had started to discuss having their own children . Later that year he appeared in the romantic psychological thriller Suspicion , the first of Grant 's four collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock . Grant did not warm to co-star Joan Fontaine , finding her to be temperamental and unprofessional . Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times considered that Grant was \" provokingly irresponsible , boyishly gay and also oddly mysterious , as the role properly demands \" . Hitchcock later stated that he thought the ending of the film in which Grant is sent to jail instead of committing suicide \" a complete mistake because of making that story with Cary Grant . Unless you have a cynical ending it makes the story too simple \" . Geoff Andrew of Time Out believes Suspicion served as \" a supreme example of Grant 's ability to be simultaneously charming and sinister \" . In 1942 Grant participated in a three-week tour of the United States as part of a group to help the war effort and was photographed visiting wounded marines in hospital . He appeared in several routines of his own during these shows and often played the straight-man opposite Bert Lahr . In May 1944 , the ten-minute propaganda short Road to Victory was released , in which he appeared alongside Bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra and Charles Ruggles . On film , in 1942 Grant played Leopold Dilg , a convict on the run in The Talk of the Town , who escapes after being wrongly convicted of arson and murder . He hides in a house with characters played by Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman , and gradually plots to secure his freedom . Crowther praised the script , and noted that Grant played Dilg with a \" casualness which is slightly disturbing \" . After a role as a foreign correspondent opposite Ginger Rogers and Walter Slezak in the off-beat comedy Once Upon a Honeymoon , in which he was praised for his scenes with Rogers , the following year he appeared in Mr. Lucky , playing a gambler in a casino aboard a ship . The commercially successful submarine war film Destination Tokyo ( 1943 ) was shot in just six weeks in the September and October , which left him exhausted ; the reviewer from Newsweek thought it was one of the finest performances of his career . In 1944 , Grant starred alongside Priscilla Lane , Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre , in Frank Capra 's dark comedy Arsenic and Old Lace , playing the manic Mortimer Brewster , who belongs to a bizarre family which includes two murderous aunts and an uncle claiming to be President Roosevelt . Grant took up the role after it was originally offered to Bob Hope , who turned it down owing to schedule conflicts . Grant found the macabre subject matter of the film difficult to contend with and believed that it was the worst performance of his career . That year he received his second Oscar nomination for a role , opposite Ethel Barrymore and Barry Fitzgerald in the Clifford Odets-directed film None but the Lonely Heart , set in London during the Depression . Late in the year he featured in the CBS Radio series Suspense , playing a tormented character who hysterically discovers that his amnesia has affected masculine order in society in \" The Black Curtain \" . = = = Post-War success and slump ( 1946 \u2013 54 ) = = = After making a brief cameo appearance opposite Claudette Colbert in Without Reservations , Grant portrayed Cole Porter in the musical Night and Day ( 1946 ) . The production proved to be problematic , with scenes often requiring multiple takes , frustrating the cast and crew . Grant next appeared with Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains in the Hitchcock-directed film Notorious ( 1946 ) , playing a government agent who recruits the American daughter of a convicted Nazi spy ( Bergman ) to infiltrate a Nazi organization in Brazil after World War II . During the course of the film Grant and Bergman 's characters fall in love and share one of the longest kisses in film history at around two-and-a-half minutes . Wansell notes how Grant 's performance \" underlined how far his unique qualities as a screen actor had matured in the years since The Awful Truth \" . In 1947 , Grant played an artist who becomes involved in a court case when charged with assault in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer , opposite Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple . The film was praised by the critics , who admired the picture 's slapstick qualities and chemistry between Grant and Loy ; it became one of the biggest-selling films at the box office that year . Later that year he starred opposite David Niven and Loretta Young in the comedy The Bishop 's Wife , playing an angel who is sent down from heaven to straighten out the relationship between the bishop ( Niven ) and his wife ( Loretta Young ) . The film was a major commercial and critical success , and was nominated for five Academy Awards . Life magazine called it \" intelligently written and competently acted \" . The following year , Grant played neurotic Jim Blandings , the title-sake in the comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House , again with Loy . Though the film picture lost a lot of money for RKO , Philip T. Hartung of Commonweal thought that Grant 's role as the \" frustrated advertising man \" was one of his best screen portrayals . In Every Girl Should Be Married , an \" airy comedy \" , he appeared with Betsy Drake and Franchot Tone , playing a bachelor who is trapped into marriage by Drake 's conniving character . He finished the year as the fourth most popular film star at the box office . In 1949 Grant starred alongside Ann Sheridan in the comedy I Was a Male War Bride in which he appeared in scenes dressed as a woman , wearing a skirt and a wig . During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight , affecting the way he looked in the picture . The film proved to be successful , becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $ 4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks 's screwball comedies of the late 1930s . By this point he was one of the highest paid Hollywood stars , commanding $ 300,000 per picture . The early 1950s marked the beginning of a slump in Grant 's career . His roles as a top brain surgeon who is caught in the middle of a bitter revolution in a Latin American country in Crisis , and as a medical-school professor and orchestra conductor opposite Jeanne Crain in People Will Talk. were poorly received . Grant had become tired of being Cary Grant after twenty years , being successful , wealthy and popular , and remarked : \" To play yourself , your true self , is the hardest thing in the world \" . In 1952 , Grant starred in the comedy Room for One More , playing an engineer husband who with his wife ( Betsy Drake ) adopt two children from an orphanage . He reunited with Howard Hawks to film the off-beat comedy Monkey Business , co-starring with Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe . Though the critic from Motion Picture Herald wrote gushingly that Grant had given a career 's best with an \" extraordinary agile and performance \" , which was matched by Rogers , it received a mixed reception overall . Grant had hoped that starring opposite Deborah Kerr in the romantic comedy Dream Wife would salvage his career , but it was a critical and financial failure upon release in July 1953 . Though he was considered for the leading part in A Star is Born , Grant believed that his film career was over , and briefly left the industry . = = = A romantic leading man and final roles ( 1955 \u2013 66 ) = = = In 1955 Grant agreed to star opposite Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief , playing a retired jewel thief nicknamed \" The Cat \" , living in the French Riviera . Grant and Kelly worked well together during the production , and marked one of the most enjoyable experiences of Grant 's career . He found Hitchock and Kelly to be very professional , and later stated that Kelly was \" possibly the finest actress I 've ever worked with \" . Grant was one of the first actors to go independent by not renewing his studio contract , effectively leaving the studio system , which almost completely controlled all aspects of an actor 's life . He decided which films he was going to appear in , often had personal choice of directors and co-stars , and at times negotiated a share of the gross revenue , something uncommon at the time . Grant received more than $ 700,000 for his 10 % of the gross of the successful To Catch a Thief , while Hitchcock received less than $ 50,000 for directing and producing it . Though critical reception to the overall film was mixed , Grant received high praise for his performance , with critics commenting on his suave , handsome appearance in the film . In 1957 Grant starred opposite Kerr in the romance An Affair to Remember , playing an international playboy who becomes the object of her affections . Schickel sees the film as one of the definitive romantic pictures of the period , but remarks that Grant was not entirely successful in trying to supersede the film 's \" gushing sentimentality \" . That year , Grant also appeared opposite Sophia Loren in The Pride and the Passion . He had expressed an interest in playing William Holden 's character in The Bridge on the River Kwai at the time , but found that it was not possible because of his commitment to The Pride and the Passion . The film was shot on location in Spain and was problematic , with co-star Frank Sinatra irritating his colleagues and leaving the production after just a few weeks . Grant 's attempts to woo Loren during the production proved fruitless , which led to him expressing anger when Paramount cast her opposite him in Houseboat ( 1958 ) as part of her contract . The sexual tension between the two was so great during the making of Houseboat that the producers found it almost impossible to make . Later in 1958 , Grant starred opposite Bergman in the romantic comedy Indiscreet , playing a successful financier who has an affair with a famous actress ( Bergman ) while pretending to be a married man . During the filming he formed a closer friendship and gained new respect for her as an actress . Schickel stated that he thought the film was possibly the finest romantic comedy film of the era , and that Grant himself had professed that it was one of his personal favorites . Grant received his first of five Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nominations for his performance and finished the year as the most popular film star at the box office . In 1959 Grant starred in the Hitchcock-directed film North by Northwest , playing an advertising executive who becomes embroiled in a case of mistaken identity . Like Indiscreet , it was warmly received by the critics and was a major commercial success , and is now often listed as one of the greatest films of all time . Weiler , writing in The New York Times , praised Grant 's performance , remarking that the actor \" was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam \" and handled the role \" with professional aplomb and grace \" . Grant wore one of his most iconic suits in the film which became very popular , a fourteen-gauge , mid-gray , worsted wool one custom-made on Savile Row . Grant finished the year playing a U. S. Navy Rear Admiral aboard a submarine opposite Tony Curtis in the comedy Operation Petticoat . The reviewer from Daily Variety saw Grant 's comic portrayal as a classic example of how to attract the laughter of the audience without lines , remarking that \" In this film , most of the gags play off him . It is his reaction , blank , startled , etc . , always underplayed , that creates or releases the humor \" . The film was major box office success , and in 1973 Deschner ranked the film as the highest earning film of Grant 's career at the US box office , with takings of $ 9.5 million . In 1960 Grant appeared opposite Robert Mitchum , Jean Simmons and Deborah Kerr in The Grass Is Greener , which was shot in England at Osterley Park and Shepperton Studios . McCann notes that Grant took great relish in \" mocking his aristocratic character 's over-refined tastes and mannerisms \" , though the film was panned and was seen as his worst since Dream Wife . In 1962 , Grant starred in the romantic comedy That Touch of Mink , playing suave , wealthy businessman Philip Shayne romantically involved with an office worker , played by Doris Day . He invites her to his apartment in Bermuda , but her guilty conscience begins to take hold . The picture was praised by critics , and it received three Academy Award nominations , and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Picture , in addition to another Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination . Deschner ranked the film has the second highest grossing of Grant 's career . Producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman originally sought Grant for the role of James Bond in Dr. No ( 1962 ) but discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film ; therefore , the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a franchise . In 1963 , Grant appeared in his last typically suave , romantic role opposite Audrey Hepburn in Charade . Grant found the experience of working with Hepburn \" wonderful \" and believed that their close relationship was clear on camera , though according to Hepburn , he was particularly worried during the filming that he would be criticized for being far too old for her and seen as a \" cradle snatcher \" . Author Chris Barsanti writes : \" It 's the film 's canny flirtatiousness that makes it such ingenious entertainment . Grant and Hepburn play off each other like the pros that they are \" . The film , well received by the critics , is often called \" the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made \" . In 1964 , Grant changed from his typically suave , distinguished screen persona to play a grizzled beachcomber Walter Eckland who is hired by a Commander ( Trevor Howard ) to serve as a lookout on Matalava Island for invading Japanese planes in the World War II romantic comedy , Father Goose . The film was a major commercial success , and upon its release at Radio City at Christmas 1964 it took over $ 210,000 at the box-office in the first week , breaking the record set by Charade the previous year . Grant 's final film , Walk , Don 't Run ( 1966 ) , a comedy co-starring Jim Hutton and Samantha Eggar , was shot on location in Tokyo , and is set amid the backdrop of the housing shortage of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics . Newsweek concluded : \" Though Grant 's personal presence is indispensable , the character he plays is almost wholly superfluous . Perhaps the inference to be taken is that a man in his 50s or 60s has no place in romantic comedy except as a catalyst . If so , the chemistry is wrong for everyone \" . Hitchcock had asked Grant to star in Torn Curtain that year only to learn that he had decided to retire . = = Later years = = Grant retired from the screen at 62 , when his daughter Jennifer was born , to focus on bringing her up and to provide a sense of permanency and stability in her life . He had become increasingly disillusioned with cinema in the 1960s , rarely finding a script that he approved of . He remarked : \" I could have gone on acting and playing a grandfather or a bum , but I discovered more important things in life \" . Grant knew after he had made Charade that the \" Golden Age \" of Hollywood was now over . He expressed little interest in making a career comeback , and continued to respond to invites or mention of it with \" fat chance \" . He did , however , briefly appear in the video documentary for Elvis 's 1970 Las Vegas concert Elvis : That 's the Way It Is , in the audience . When he was gifted with the negatives from a number of his films in the 1970s , Grant sold them to television for a sum of over two million dollars in 1975 . Morecambe and Stirling argue that Grant 's abstinence from film after 1966 was \" not the actions of a man who had irrevocably turned his back on the film industry , but one who was caught between a decision made and the temptation to a eat a bit of humble pie and re-announce himself to the cinema-going public \" . In the 1970s , MGM were keen on remaking Grand Hotel ( 1932 ) , and hoped to lure Grant into coming out of retirement to star . Hitchcock had long wanted to make a film based on the idea of Hamlet , with Grant in the lead role . Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to try to get him to play the role of Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait ( 1978 ) , which eventually went to James Mason . Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class ( 1973 ) , The Verdict ( 1982 ) and a film adaptation of William Goldman 's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade . In the late 1970s and early 1980s Grant became troubled by the deaths of so many of his close friends , including Howard Hughes in 1976 , Howard Hawks in 1977 , Lord Mountbatten and Barbara Hutton in 1979 , Alfred Hitchcock in 1980 , Grace Kelly and Ingrid Bergman in 1982 and David Niven in 1983 . At the funeral of Mountbatten he was quoted as remarking to a friend : \" I 'm absolutely pooped , and I 'm so goddamned old ... I 'm going to quit all next year . I 'm going to lie in bed ... I shall just close all doors , turn off the telephone , and enjoy my life \" . Kelly 's death was the hardest hitting on Grant , as the death was unexpected , and the two remained close friends after filming To Catch a Thief . Grant visited Monaco three or four times each year during his retirement , and showed his support for Kelly by joining the board of the Princess Grace Foundation . In 1980 , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art put on a two-month retrospective of over 40 of Grant 's films . In 1982 he was honored with the \" Man of the Year \" award by the New York Friars Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . He turned 80 in 1984 ; Peter Bogdanovich noticed that a \" serenity \" had come over the actor . Grant was in good health until suffering a mild stroke in October that year . In the last few years of his life , he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man show , A Conversation with Cary Grant , in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions . He made some 36 public appearances in his last four years , from New Jersey to Texas , and found his audiences changed from elderly film buffs to enthusiastic college students discovering his films for the first time . Grant admitted that he thought the appearances were \" ego-fodder \" , remarking that \" I know who I am inside and outside , but it 's nice to have the outside , at least , substantiated \" . = = Business interests = = Stirling refers to Grant as \" one of the shrewdest businessmen ever to operate in Hollywood \" . His long-term friendship with Howard Hughes from the 1930s onward saw him invited into the most glamorous circles in Hollywood and their lavish parties . Biographers Morecambe and Stirling state that Hughes played a major role in the development of Grant 's business interests , so that by 1939 , he was \" already an astute operator with various commercial interests \" . Scott also played a role , encouraging Grant to invest his money in shares , making him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s . In the 1940s , Grant and Barbara Hutton invested heavily in real estate development in Acapulco at a time when it was little more than a fishing village , and teamed with Richard Widmark , Roy Rogers , and Red Skelton to buy a hotel there . Behind his business interests was a particularly intelligent mind , to the point that his friend David Niven once said : \" Before computers went into general release , Cary had one in his brain \" . Film critic David Thomson believes that Grant 's intelligence came across on screen , and stated that \" no one else looked so good and so intelligent at the same time \" . After Grant retired from the screen , he became more active in business . He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberg\u00e9 . This position was not honorary , as some had assumed ; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them . His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career , a salary of a reported $ 15,000 a year . Such was Grant 's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $ 50 million in 1968 , a growth of nearly 80 % since the inaugural year in 1964 . The position also permitted use of a private plane , which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother , Dyan Cannon , was working . In 1975 , Grant was an appointed director of MGM . In 1980 , he sat on the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company . He played an active role in the promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973 and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s . When Allen Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he noticed how tired Grant looked , and his \" slightly melancholic air \" . Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park , the Academy of Magical Arts ( The Magic Castle , Hollywood , California ) , and Western Airlines ( acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987 ) . = = Personal life = = One of the wealthiest stars in Hollywood , Grant owned houses in Beverly Hills , Malibu , and Palm Springs . Immaculate in his personal grooming , Edith Head , the renowned Hollywood costume designer , appreciated his \" meticulous \" attention to detail and considered him to have had the greatest fashion sense of any actor she had worked with . McCann attests his \" almost obsessive maintenance \" with tanning , which deepened the older he got , to Douglas Fairbanks , who also had a major influence on his refined sense of dress . McCann notes that because Grant came from a working-class background and was not well educated , he made a particular effort over the course of his career to mix with high society and absorb their knowledge , manners and etiquette to compensate and cover it up . His image was meticulously crafted from the early days in Hollywood , where he would frequently sunbathe and avoid being photographed smoking , despite smoking two packs a day at the time . Grant quit smoking in the early 1950s through hypnotherapy . He remained health conscious , staying very trim and athletic even into his late career , though Grant admitted he \" never crook [ ed ] a finger to keep fit \" . He confessed that he did \" everything in moderation . Except making love \" . Grant 's daughter Jennifer stated that her father made hundreds of friends from all walks of life , and that their house was frequently visited by the likes of Frank and Barbara Sinatra , Quincy Jones , Gregory Peck and his wife Veronique , Johnny Carson and his wife , Kirk Kerkorian and Merv Griffin . She said that Grant and Sinatra were the closest of friends and that both men were remarkably similar in that they both shared a similar radiance and \" indefinable incandescence of charm \" , and were eternally \" high on life \" . While raising Jennifer , Grant archived artefacts of her childhood and adolescence in a bank-quality , room-sized vault he had installed in the house . Jennifer attributed this meticulous collection to the fact that artefacts of his own childhood had been destroyed during the Luftwaffe 's bombing of Bristol in the Second World War ( an event that also claimed the lives of his uncle , aunt , cousin , and the cousin 's husband and grandson ) , and he may have wanted to prevent her from experiencing a similar loss . Grant lived with actor Randolph Scott off and on for 12 years , which several authors have claimed was a gay or bisexual relationship . The two had first met early on in Grant 's career in 1932 at the Paramount studio when Scott was filming Sky Bride at the same time as Grant was shooting Sinners in the Sun , and moved in together soon afterwards . Scott 's biographer Robert Nott states that there is no evidence that Grant and Scott were homosexual , and blames rumors on material written about them in other books , which was assumed true by historians . Grant 's daughter , Jennifer , denied the claims . When Chevy Chase joked on television in 1980 that Grant was a \" homo . What a gal ! \" , Grant sued him for slander , and Chase was forced to retract his words . Grant became a fan of Morecambe and Wise in the 1960s , and remained friends with Eric Morecambe until his death in 1984 . Grant began experimenting with the drug LSD in the late 1950s , before it become commercially popular . His wife , Betsy Drake , displayed a keen interest in psychotherapy , and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis . Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s , with Grant optimistic that the treatment could make him feel better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships . He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years . For a long time , Grant viewed the drug positively , and stated that it was the solution after many years of \" searching for his peace of mind \" , and that for first time in his life he was \" truly , deeply and honestly happy \" . Cannon claimed during a court hearing , in which she claimed he was an \" apostle of LSD \" , that he was still taking the drug in 1967 as part of a remedy to save their relationship . Grant later admitted that \" taking LSD was an utterly foolish thing to do but I was a self-opinionated boor , hiding all kinds of layers and defences , hypocrisy and vanity . I had to get rid of them and wipe the slate clean \" . = = = Relationships = = = Grant was married five times . He wed Virginia Cherrill on February 9 , 1934 at Caxton Hall registry office in London . She divorced him on March 26 , 1935 , following charges that Grant had hit her . The two were involved in a bitter divorce case which was widely reported in the press , with Cherrill demanding $ 1000 a week from her husband in benefits from his Paramount earnings . After the demise of the marriage , he dated actress Phyllis Brooks from 1937 . They had considered marriage , and vacationed together in Europe in the summer of 1939 , visiting the Roman villa of Dorothy di Frasso in Italy , before the relationship ended later that year . Grant became a naturalized United States citizen on June 26 , 1942 , at which time he also legally changed his name from \" Archibald Alexander Leach \" to \" Cary Grant \" . That year he married Barbara Hutton , one of the wealthiest women in the world following a $ 50 million inheritance from her grandfather , Frank Winfield Woolworth . The couple was derisively nicknamed \" Cash and Cary \" , although in an extensive prenuptial agreement Grant refused any financial settlement in the event of a divorce , to avoid the accusation that he married for money . Towards the end of their marriage they lived in a white mansion at 10615 Bellagio Road in Bel Air . After divorcing in 1945 , they remained the \" fondest of friends \" . After dating Betty Hensel for a period , on December 25 , 1949 , Grant married Betsy Drake , the co-star of two of his films . This would prove to be his longest marriage , ending on August 14 , 1962 . Grant married Dyan Cannon on July 22 , 1965 , at friend Howard Hughes 's Desert Inn in Las Vegas . Their daughter , Jennifer , was born on February 26 , 1966 . Jennifer is Grant 's only child . He frequently called Jennifer his \" best production \" . He said of fatherhood : \" My life changed the day Jennifer was born . I 've come to think that the reason we 're put on this earth is to procreate . To leave something behind . Not films , because you know that I don 't think my films will last very long once I 'm gone . But another human being . That 's what 's important . \" Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968 . On March 12 that month he was involved in a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine . Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising . Grant had a brief affair with self-proclaimed actress Cynthia Bouron in the late 1960s , Grant , who had been at odds with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1958 , was named as the recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 1970 . Grant announced that he would attend the awards ceremony to accept his award , thus ending his twelve-year boycott of the ceremony . Two days after this announcement , Ms. Bouron filed a paternity suit against Grant and publicly stated he was the father of her seven-week-old daughter . Bouron named Grant as the father on the child 's birth certificate . Grant challenged her to a blood test and Bouron failed to provide one , and the court ordered her to remove his name from the certificate . Between 1973 and 1977 he dated British photojournalist Maureen Donaldson , followed by the much younger Victoria Morgan . On April 11 , 1981 , Grant married Barbara Harris , a British hotel public relations agent who was 47 years his junior . The two had met at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London five years earlier where Harris was working at the time and Grant attending a Faberg\u00e9 conference . The two became friends , but it wasn 't until 1979 that she moved to live with him in California . Friends of Grant considered her to have had an extremely positive impact on Grant , and Prince Rainier of Monaco remarked that he had \" never been happier \" than he was in his last years with her . = = = Death = = = Grant was at the Adler Theatre in Davenport , Iowa , on the afternoon of November 29 , 1986 , preparing for his performance for the Conversation with Cary Grant when he was taken ill . Though his close friend Roderick Mann recalled that he had met up with Grant at the Hollywood Park Racetrack earlier that month and he had been in a jovial state and in good health , Grant had been feeling unwell as he arrived at the theatre . Basil Williams , who photographed him there , thought that though Grant still looked his usual suave self , he noticed that he seemed very tired and that he stumbled once in the auditorium . Williams recalls that Grant rehearsed for half an hour before \" something seemed wrong \" all of a sudden , and he disappeared backstage . Grant was taken back to the Blackhawk Hotel where he and his wife Barbara had checked in , and a doctor was called and discovered that Grant was having a massive stroke , with a blood pressure reading of 210 over 130 . Grant refused to be taken to hospital . The doctor recalled that \" The stroke was getting worse . In only fifteen minutes he deteriorated rapidly . It was terrible watching him die and not being able to help . But he wouldn 't let us \" . By 8 : 45 p.m. Grant had slipped into a coma and was taken to St. Luke 's Hospital . He spent 45 minutes in emergency before being transferred to intensive care , where he was pronounced dead at 11 : 22 p.m. He was 82 . The New York Times reported : \" Cary Grant was not supposed to die . Cary Grant was supposed to stick around . Our perpetual touchstone of charm and elegance and youth \" . Grant 's body was taken back to California , where it was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean . He refused a funeral , which Roderick Mann remarked was appropriate for \" the private man who didn 't want the nonsense of a funeral \" . The bulk of his estate , worth in the region of 60 to 80 million dollars , went to his wife Barbara Harris and his daughter Jennifer Grant . He also gave goods valued at $ 150,000 to beloved employees , $ 50,000 to the Motion Picture Relief Fund , $ 25,000 to Variety Clubs International , $ 20,000 to the John Tracy Clinic for deafness , $ 10,000 to LSD doctor Mortimer Hartman , and his clothes and personal belongings to Frank Sinatra , Roderick Mann , Stanley Donen , Kirk Kerkorian and others . = = Screen persona = = McCann notes that one of reasons that Grant was so successful with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen , acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period . George Cukor once stated : \" You see , he didn 't depend on his looks . He wasn 't a narcissist , he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man . And that made it all the more appealing , that a handsome young man was funny ; that was especially unexpected and good because we think , ' Well , if he 's a Beau Brummel , he can 't be either funny or intelligent ' , but he proved otherwise \" . Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor , and said that he was just the opposite of that , playing the \" basic man \" . Grant 's appeal was unusually broad , among both men and women ; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him . She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars differently to most of the leading players at the time , regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than \" treating them as sex objects \" . For writer David Shipman , he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be , whether it was an uncle , best friend or lover , and \" more than most stars he belonged to the public \" . A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one . Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky ( 1943 ) stated that if it \" weren 't for Cary Grant 's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all \" . For McCann Hollywood had \" found its ideal gentleman , a gentleman for a democratic culture . He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity , wealth and virtue , elite and mass , high and low , great and good \" . He states that Grant 's delivery should \" not have worked , but somehow it did \" , commenting : \" As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth , he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has , against all the odds , actually come off . He smiles at us , sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune . He smiles a smile like Gatbsy 's smile . \" Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a \" new and very important symbol \" , a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types , who represented the \" freedom , natural grace , simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan \" , which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America . McCann notes that Grant typically played \" wealthy privileged characters who never seemed to have any need to work in order to maintain their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle . He became a star whose characters were good looking , quick witted , funny and athletic , a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying \" . Martin Stirling , commenting in the biography Cary Grant : In Name Only , thought that Grant had an acting range which was \" greater than any of his contemporaries , but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor . He believes that Grant was always at his \" physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce \" . Charles Champlin , commenting in Donald Deschner 's The Complete Films of Cary Grant ( 1973 ) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant 's screen persona , in his unusual ability to \" mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes \" . He remarks that Grant was \" refreshingly able to play the near-fool , the fey idiot , without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake . His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is , as a matter of fact , probably unique among superstars . Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it \" . Wansell further notes that Grant could , \" with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint of a smile , question his own image \" , managing to \" blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done , by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously , and mixing his own unique mixture of na\u00efvet\u00e9 and worldliness \" . Stanley Donen , a director who had worked with Grant , stated that his real \" magic \" came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real , which came from \" enormous amounts of work \" rather than being God-given . Grant remarked of his career : \" I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing . I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person , Or he became me \" . He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy , unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the \" well-tailored charmer \" of Charade . Grant often poked fun at himself with statements such as , \" Everyone wants to be Cary Grant \u2014 even I want to be Cary Grant \" , and in ad-lib lines \u2014 such as in the film His Girl Friday ( 1940 ) , saying , \" Listen , the last man who said that to me was Archie Leach , just a week before he cut his throat . \" In Arsenic and Old Lace ( 1944 ) , a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach . According to a famous story now believed to be fictional , after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking , \" How old Cary Grant ? \" , Grant reportedly responded , \" Old Cary Grant fine . How you ? \" Despite his strong comedic qualities , Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles , with a mysterious , dangerous quality , remarking that \" there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on \" . Wansell notes that this darker , mysterious side extended to his personal life , which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image . = = Legacy = = Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the \" greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known \" . Schickel stated that there are \" very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant , art of a very high and subtle order \" , and thought that he was the \" best star actor there ever was in the movies \" . David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema . He was a favorite of Hitchcock , who called him \" the only actor I ever loved in my whole life \" , and remained one of Hollywood 's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years . Wansell wrote : \" To millions of movie-goers around the world , Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour , and the style , of Hollywood in its golden years . With his dark hair , and even darker eyes , mischievous smile and effortless elegance , he was , is , and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars . Since his death in 1986 , the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment \" . Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately , because he \" embodies what seems a happier time \u2212 a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer . \" Grant was nominated for two Academy Awards , for Penny Serenade ( 1941 ) and None But the Lonely Heart ( 1944 ) , but never won a competitive Oscar ; he received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970 . The inscription on his statuette read \" To Cary Grant , for his unique mastery of the art of screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues \" . On being presented with the award , his friend Frank Sinatra announced : \" It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting ... No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has , and nobody has done so many things so well \" . At the Straw Hat Awards in New York in May 1975 , Grant was awarded a special plaque which recognized the city 's appreciation of him as a \" star and superstar in entertainment \" . The following August , he was invited by Betty Ford to give a speech at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City and to attend the Bicentenary dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at the White House that same year . He was later invited to attend a royal charity gala at the London Palladium in 1978 . In 1979 , Grant hosted the American Film Institute 's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock , and presented Laurence Olivier with his honorary Oscar . In 1981 , Grant was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors . Three years later , a theatre on the MGM lot was renamed the \" Cary Grant Theatre \" . In 1995 , when over a hundred leading film directors were asked to reveal their favorite actor of all time in a Time Out poll , Grant came second only to Marlon Brando . On December 7 , 2001 , a statue of Grant was unveiled in Millennium Square , a regenerated area next to Bristol Harbour , Bristol , in the city where he was born . In November 2005 , Grant again came first in Premiere magazine 's list of \" The 50 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time \" . According to McCann , ten years earlier they had declared that Grant was \" quite simply , the funniest actor cinema has ever produced \" . = = Filmography and stage work = =",

Moffat 's first television work was the teen drama series Press Gang . His first sitcom , Joking Apart , was inspired by the breakdown of his first marriage ; conversely , his later sitcom Coupling was based upon the development of his relationship with television producer Sue Vertue . In between the two relationship-centred shows , he wrote Chalk , a sitcom set in a comprehensive school inspired by his own experience as an English teacher . A lifelong fan of Doctor Who , Moffat 's first work on the series was the script of the parody episode The Curse of Fatal Death in 1999 . He then wrote six episodes of the revived series which began in 2005 ( \" The Empty Child \" , \" The Doctor Dances \" , \" The Girl in the Fireplace \" , \" Blink \" , \" Silence in the Library \" , and \" Forest of the Dead \" ) . In 2010 he replaced Russell T Davies as showrunner , lead writer and executive producer . The same year , he created Sherlock along with Mark Gatiss . In January 2016 , it was announced that Moffat would step down from being showrunner of Doctor Who after the spring 2017 season finale , and that Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall would take over . He also co-wrote Steven Spielberg 's The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn in 2011 . Moffat has won several awards , mainly for Doctor Who and Sherlock , including an Emmy Award , five BAFTA Awards and four Hugo Awards . = = Early life and Press Gang = = Moffat was born in Paisley , Scotland , where he attended Camphill High School . He studied at the University of Glasgow , where he was involved with the student television station , GUST ( Glasgow University Student Television ) . After gaining an MA degree in English from Glasgow , he worked as a teacher for three and a half years at Cowdenknowes High School , Greenock . In the 1980s he wrote a play entitled War Zones ( performed at the 1985 Glasgow Mayfest and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe ) and a musical called Knifer . His father , Bill Moffat , was a head teacher at Thorn Primary School in Johnstone , Renfrewshire ; when the school was used for Harry Secombe 's Highway in the late 1980s , he mentioned to the producers that he had an idea for a television series about a school newspaper . The producers asked for a sample script , to which Bill Moffat agreed on condition his son write it . Producer Sandra Hastie said that it was \" the best ever first script \" that she had read . The resulting series was titled Press Gang , starring Julia Sawalha and Dexter Fletcher , and ran for five series on ITV between 1989 and 1993 , with Moffat writing all forty-three episodes . The programme won a BAFTA award in its second series . During production of the second series of Press Gang , Moffat was experiencing an unhappy personal life as a result of the break-up of his first marriage . The producer was secretly phoning his friends at home to check on his state . His wife 's new lover was represented in the episode \" The Big Finish ? \" by the character Brian Magboy ( Simon Schatzberger ) , a name inspired by Brian : Maggie 's boy . Moffat brought in the character so that all sorts of unfortunate things would happen to him , such as having a typewriter dropped on his foot . = = Joking Apart = = By 1990 , Moffat had written two series of Press Gang , but the programme 's high cost along with organisational changes at backers Central Independent Television cast its future in doubt . As Moffat wondered what to do next and worried about his future employment , Bob Spiers , Press Gang 's primary director , suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom . Inspired by his experience working in education , Moffat 's initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk , a sitcom set in a school that eventually aired in 1997 . During the pitch meeting at the Groucho Club , Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking passionately about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead of a school sitcom . Taking Ptaszynski 's advice , Moffat 's new idea was about \" a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him \" . Moffat wrote two series of Joking Apart , which was directed by Bob Spiers , and starred Robert Bathurst and Fiona Gillies . The show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys . In an interview with Richard Herring , Moffat says that \" The sit-com actually lasted slightly longer than my marriage . \" Fiona Gillies , who played the adulteress Becky , says that she was aware that some of her dialogue was based on what had been said to Moffat during his own separation . Moffat recycled his own dialogue : when he had learned that his wife 's lover was a fan of Press Gang , he replied , \" Well , did he have to fuck my wife ? Most people just write in ! \" . The line , with the expletive replaced by \" shagged \" , was used in the first episode of Joking Apart . Speaking about the autobiographical elements of the show , the writer jokes that he has to remember that his wife didn 't leave him for an estate agent ; his wife was an estate agent . Conversely , his later sitcom Coupling was based on his relationship with his second wife , TV producer Sue Vertue . Moffat reused the surname \" Taylor \" , which is Mark 's surname in Joking Apart , for Jack Davenport 's character Steve in Coupling . He wrote three episodes of Murder Most Horrid , an anthology series of comedic tales starring Dawn French . The first ( \" Overkill \" , directed by Bob Spiers ) was identified by the BBC as a \" highlight \" of the series . His other two episodes were \" Dying Live \" ( dir . Dewi Humphreys ) and \" Elvis , Jesus and Zack \" ( dir . Tony Dow ) . = = Chalk and Coupling = = Between marriages , Moffat claims that he \" shagged [ his ] way round television studios like a mechanical digger . \" According to an interview with The New York Times , Moffat met television producer Sue Vertue at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1996 . Vertue had been working for Tiger Aspect , a production company run by Peter Bennett-Jones . Bennett-Jones and his friend and former colleague Andre Ptaszynski , who had worked with Moffat on Joking Apart , told Moffat and Vertue that each fancied the other . A relationship blossomed and they left their respective production companies to join Hartswood Films , run by Beryl Vertue , Sue 's mother . The couple have two children together : Joshua and Louis . Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood , Ptaszynski produced Chalk , the series that the writer had pitched to him at the beginning of the decade . Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis , the show was based on Moffat 's three years as an English teacher . The studio audience responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired . However , it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997 , who had taken exception to the BBC 's publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers . In an interview in the early 2000s , Moffat refuses to even name the series , joking that he might get attacked in the street . After production wrapped on Chalk in 1997 , Moffat announced to the cast that he was marrying Vertue . When she eventually asked him for a sitcom , he decided to base it around the evolution of their own relationship . Coupling was first broadcast on BBC2 in 2000 , with his wife producing for Hartswood Films . The series proved to be highly successful , running until 2004 and producing four series and twenty-eight episodes , all written by Moffat . He also wrote the original , unbroadcast pilot episode for the U.S. version , also titled Coupling , although this was less successful and was cancelled after four episodes on the NBC network . Moffat has blamed its failure on an unprecedented level of network interference . = = Jekyll , Tintin , and Sherlock = = He wrote the Hartswood Films drama series Jekyll , a modern version of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , which aired on BBC One in June and July 2007 . In an interview with The Age , James Nesbitt , who played the eponymous character , called Moffat \" an eccentric , shy fellow \" , while commending his writing as \" inventive and dark and funny \" . In June 2007 Moffat told The Stage that he was working on a new sitcom . Provisionally titled Adam and Eve , it concerned a boss and his personal assistant , who are long-term friends but never get together . In October 2007 it was reported that Moffat would be scripting a trilogy of The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn films for directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson . According to The Times newspaper , Moffat had to be \" love bombed \" by Spielberg into accepting the offer to write the films , with the director promising to shield him from studio interference with his writing . He had intended to complete work on the whole trilogy before resuming work on Doctor Who , but the intervening WGA strike meant he could submit a finished script for the first film only . In July 2008 , Moffat was quoted by the Daily Mail as saying : \" I could not work on the second Tintin film and work on Doctor Who . So I chose Doctor Who . \" Moffat says that Spielberg was \" lovely \" about his decision . The script was completed by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish , with a part of Moffat 's script used in the film . Moffat remains a writer for Hartswood Films even after his appointment as show-runner for Doctor Who . During their journeys from London to Cardiff for Doctor Who , Moffat and Mark Gatiss conceived a contemporary update of Sherlock Holmes , called Sherlock . Benedict Cumberbatch was cast as Holmes , with Martin Freeman as Dr Watson . A 60-minute pilot , written by Moffat , was filmed in January 2009 . The pilot was not broadcast , but three 90-minute episodes were commissioned . Moffat wrote the first of these , \" A Study in Pink \" , which was broadcast on 25 July 2010 on BBC One and BBC HD . A second series was broadcast in January 2012 , for which Moffat wrote the episode \" A Scandal in Belgravia \" , with a third following in January 2014 . = = Doctor Who = = Moffat has been a fan of Doctor Who since childhood . In 1995 , he contributed a segment to Paul Cornell 's Virgin New Adventures novel Human Nature . His first solo Doctor Who work was a short story , \" Continuity Errors \" , published in the 1996 Virgin Books anthology Decalog 3 : Consequences . In 1999 he scripted the parody Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death , which aired as part of Comic Relief 's Red Nose Day charity telethon . The co-producer for that year 's Comic Relief telethon was Moffat 's then-new wife , Sue Vertue . In 2004 , Moffat was signed to write for the revival of Doctor Who . He became known , according to The Guardian , for writing \" the clever , darker episodes \" of the first four series of the show . His contribution for the 2005 series was the two-part story \" The Empty Child \" \/ \" The Doctor Dances \" . In the DVD audio commentary he says that he waited forty years to see his name appear on top of that theme music . He wrote an episode for each of the two following series : \" The Girl in the Fireplace \" in the 2006 series and \" Blink \" in the 2007 series . Moffat won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form three years in a row for his contributions . \" The Girl in the Fireplace \" and \" Blink \" were both nominated for Nebula Awards . \" Blink \" also gained him the BAFTA Craft Award for Best Writer , and a BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Screenwriter . In the Doctor Who Magazine reader poll for the 2007 series , Moffat was voted as best writer and \" Blink \" as the best story . He also wrote the 2007 Children in Need \" special scene \" \" Time Crash \" . He wrote a two-part story for series four in 2008 , titled \" Silence in the Library \" \/ \" Forest of the Dead \" , making Moffat and series executive producer Russell T Davies the only writers to have contributed scripts to the first four series of the revived show . In March 2008 , Davies said that he often rewrote scripts from other writers , but didn 't \" touch a word \" of Moffat 's episodes . Moffat 's script for series four secured him his fourth consecutive Hugo Awards nomination , though it did not win . The BBC announced in May 2008 that Moffat would be taking over from Russell T Davies as head writer and executive producer for the revived show 's fifth series , to be broadcast in 2010 , although Davies had initiated discussions with Moffat regarding this as far back as July 2007 . Commenting on his appointment , Moffat said it was \" the proper duty of every British subject to come to the aid of the TARDIS \" . Production on Moffat 's time in charge of the programme began in July 2009 . As executive producer and head writer , he was significantly involved in casting Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor . Smith first appeared as the Doctor at the end of Davies and David Tennant 's final episode , the second part of The End of Time , in a short post-regeneration scene that Davies left for Moffat to write himself . Moffat wrote the scene in \" about ten minutes \" as \" a bit of fun banter \" for the new Doctor . In addition to his television episodes , Moffat has also contributed stories to Panini Publishing 's Doctor Who Storybook series , penning the short stories \" What I Did on My Christmas Holidays By Sally Sparrow \" for the 2006 book ( which later formed the basis of his TV episode \" Blink \" ) , \" Corner of the Eye \" for the 2007 volume and \" A Letter From the Doctor \" which opens the 2009 Storybook . In June 2015 , Moffat was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to drama . = = Writing credits = = = = Awards and nominations = =",

She appeared in magazine , newspaper and television advertising , before she made her debut role in the 1984 crime film Once Upon a Time in America . Connelly continued modeling and acting , starring in films such as the 1986 film Labyrinth and the 1991 films Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer . She gained critical acclaim for her work in the 1998 science fiction film Dark City and for her portrayal of Marion Silver in the 2000 drama Requiem for a Dream . In 2002 , Connelly won an Academy Award , a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award for her supporting role as Alicia Nash in Ron Howard 's 2001 biopic A Beautiful Mind . Her later credits include the 2003 Marvel superhero film Hulk where she played Bruce Banner 's true love Betty Ross , the 2005 horror film Dark Water , the 2006 drama Blood Diamond , the 2008 science fiction remake The Day the Earth Stood Still , the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That into You and the 2009 biographical drama Creation . She re-teamed with her Requiem for a Dream director Darren Aronofsky and A Beautiful Mind co-star Russell Crowe for the 2014 biblical epic Noah . Connelly was named Amnesty International Ambassador for Human Rights Education in 2005 . She has been the face of Balenciaga fashion advertisements , as well as for Revlon cosmetics .

Her mother was Jewish and was educated at a yeshiva ; Ilene 's family had emigrated from Poland and Russia . Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights , near the Brooklyn Bridge , where she attended Saint Ann 's , a private school specializing in the Arts . Her father suffered from asthma , so the family moved to Woodstock , New York , in 1976 to escape the city smog . Four years later , the family returned to Brooklyn Heights , and Connelly returned to Saint Ann 's . = = Career = = = = = Child modeling and early film appearances = = = When Connelly was 10 years old , an advertising executive friend of her father suggested she audition as a model . Her parents sent a picture of her to the Ford Modeling Agency , which shortly after added her to its roster . Connelly began modeling for print advertisements before moving on to television commercials . In an interview with The Guardian , she revealed that , after having done some modeling , she had no aspirations to become an actor . She appeared on the cover of several issues of Seventeen in 1986 and 1988 . In December 1986 , she recorded two pop songs for the Japanese market : \" Monologue of Love \" and \" Message of Love \" . Connelly sang in phonetic Japanese as she did not speak the language . Her mother started taking her to acting auditions . At once , Connelly was selected for a supporting role as the aspiring dancer and actress Deborah Gelly in Sergio Leone 's 1984 gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America . The role required performing a ballet routine . During the audition , Connelly , who had no ballet training , tried to imitate a ballerina . Her performance , and the similarity of her nose to Elizabeth McGovern 's , who played the character as an adult , convinced the director to cast her . Connelly described the movie as \" an incredibly idyllic introduction to movie-making \" . While Once Upon a Time in America was being filmed , Connelly made her first television appearance , in the episode \" Stranger in Town \" of the British series Tales of the Unexpected . Her first leading role was in Italian giallo-director Dario Argento 's 1985 film Phenomena , as a girl who uses her psychic powers to communicate with insects , in order to pursue the serial killer of students of the Swiss school where she has just enrolled . She next had the lead in the coming-of-age movie Seven Minutes in Heaven , released the same year . Of her early career , she said , \" Before I knew it , [ acting ] became what I did . It was a very peculiar way to grow up , combined with my personality . \" She described feeling like \" a kind of walking puppet \" through her adolescence , without having time alone to deal with the attention her career was generating . = = = 1980s \u2013 1990s = = = Connelly gained public recognition with Jim Henson 's 1986 film Labyrinth with David Bowie , in which she played Sarah , a teenager on a quest to rescue her brother Toby from the world of goblins . Although a disappointment at the box office , the film later became a cult classic . The New York Times , while noting the importance of her part , panned her portrayal : \" Jennifer Connelly as Sarah is unfortunately disappointing . ... She looks right , but she lacks conviction and seems to be reading rehearsed lines that are recited without belief in her goal or real need to accomplish it . \" Two years later , she starred as a ballet student in the Italian film \u00c9toile , and portrayed college student Gabby in Michael Hoffman 's Some Girls . Balancing work and school , she studied English for two years at Yale University in 1988 and 1989 , before transferring to Stanford University in 1990 to study drama . There , she trained with Roy London , Howard Fine and Harold Guskin . Encouraged by her parents to continue with her film career , Connelly left college and returned to the movie industry the same year . In 1990 , Dennis Hopper directed The Hot Spot , in which Connelly played Gloria Harper , a woman being blackmailed . The film was a box office failure but Connelly was praised . Stephen Schaefer wrote for USA Today , \" Anyone looking for proof that little girls do grow up fast in the movies should take a gander at curvaceous Jennifer Connelly [ ... ] in The Hot Spot . Not yet 20 , Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue \" . During an interview with Shaeffer , Connelly commented on her first nude scene : \" The nudity was hard for me and something I thought about ... but it 's not in a sleazy context \" . The same year , director Garry Marshall considered her for the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman , but ultimately felt that she was too young for the part . Connelly 's next film was the 1991 romantic comedy Career Opportunities , starring alongside Frank Whaley . People magazine criticized the film for exploiting Connelly 's body . The marketing included a life-size cardboard cutout showing Whaley watching Connelly ride a mechanical horse , with the caption \" He 's about to have the ride of his life \" . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Connelly said that a Yale professor brought it to her attention and \" ... that wasn 't something I felt all that comfortable about \" . The big-budget Disney film The Rocketeer ( 1991 ) followed later that year , but failed to ignite her career . She played Jenny Blake , the aspiring actress girlfriend of stunt pilot Cliff , \" the Rocketeer \" . New York characterized the movie as \" pallid \" . The review said of her performance , \" Connelly is properly cast ; she has the moist , full-to-the-cheek bones sensuality of the Hollywood starlets of that period , but she 's a little straight \" . She appeared alongside Jason Priestley in the Roy Orbison music video for \" I Drove All Night \" the following year . Connelly next appeared in Of Love and Shadows , a 1994 Argentine-American drama film written and directed by Betty Kaplan starring Antonio Banderas . In 1995 , director John Singleton cast Connelly as a lesbian college student in Higher Learning . She next appeared in the 1996 independent film Far Harbor as Elie , a prominent person in a Hollywood studio who writes a screenplay based on her traumas . It was followed that year by the neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls , which featured the murder of Allison Pond ( Connelly ) , mistress of General Timms ( John Malkovich ) , and the investigation by a group of detectives led by Maxwell Hoover ( Nick Nolte ) . New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond : \" This footage is actually dirty . That is , it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it , but it 's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away \" . About nudity in the movie , Connelly said : \" It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie , because I had always been so careful about nudity , it was very much a part of this character and I couldn 't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn 't work . It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on , I guess \" . She began to appear in small-budget films which did well with critics , such as 1997 's drama Inventing the Abbotts , set in the late 1950s , in which she played the part of Eleanor , one of three daughters of the town millionaire , Lloyd Abbott . About her performance , director Ron Howard said , \" She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity . She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty , and I guess I stored that information in the back of my brain \" . Her next appearance was in the critically acclaimed 1998 science fiction film Dark City , where she played alongside Rufus Sewell , William Hurt , Ian Richardson and Kiefer Sutherland . Connelly portrayed femme fatale Emma , a torch singer whose husband , John Murdoch ( Rufus Sewell ) , suffers from amnesia . As Murdoch is regaining his memories , Emma is kidnapped by Mr. Hand ( Richard O 'Brien ) and The Strangers , who alter her memories and assign her a new identity . Author Sean McMullen wrote , \" Jennifer Connelly is visually splendid as the 1940s femme fatale ( Emma ) . \" The animated drawing of Aladdin was modelled after Tom Cruise and Jasmine was based on Connelly . = = = Early 2000s = = = In 2001 , Ed Harris directed Connelly in the biopic Pollock in which she played Ruth Kligman , Jackson Pollock 's mistress . In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film , Requiem for a Dream , directed by Darren Aronofsky and based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby , Jr . Connelly played Marion Silver , the girlfriend of Harry , played by Jared Leto ; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn . Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop . She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution . Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived . During her time in the apartment , Connelly isolated herself , painted , listened to music that she considered that her character would , designed clothes , and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin . Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery . Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors ' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation . Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives . The critic Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times , \" Ms. Connelly , too , whittled herself down to a new weight class , and it 's her performance that gives the movie weight , since her fall is the most precipitous . By the end , when she curls into a happy fetal ball with a furtive smile on her face , she has come to love her debasement .... Her dank realization is more disturbing than anything in the novel , and Ms. Connelly has never before done anything to prepare us for how good she is here . \" During 2000 , she appeared as Catherine Miller in the FOX drama series The $ treet , about a brokerage house in New York . Also in 2000 , she appeared in Waking the Dead , a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name , playing Sarah Williams , an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees ( Strangely , Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly 's character in Labyrinth ) . Initially , director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress . Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly 's performance in Far Harbor . Gordon later said : \" There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for . \" About her role , Connelly said , \" Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing . I was really trying to make something of the part and threw myself into it , so that meant a lot to me \" . The New York Times described her performance , \" As Sarah , Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period . And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor . \" The script of Ron Howard 's 2001 film A Beautiful Mind , loosely based on Sylvia Nasar 's 1998 biography of the mathematician John Nash , sparked her interest in the project . Connelly was invited to an audition after her agent Risa Shapiro sent the producers a tape with a clip of the yet unreleased Requiem for a Dream . She was cast by the film 's producer , Brian Grazer , as Alicia Nash , the caring and enduring wife of the brilliant , schizophrenic mathematician , played by Russell Crowe . Howard and the producers eventually chose them after being particularly impressed by their screen chemistry . The film was a critical and commercial success , grossing more than US $ 313 million worldwide . Connelly had the chance to meet the real Alicia Nash before starting shooting and learned more about her life . For her portrayal , Connelly earned a Golden Globe , an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress , and a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Supporting Role . Time magazine critic Richard Schickel called her performance \" luminous \" and the actress intelligent and passionate . Roger Ebert wrote , \" ... Jennifer Connelly is luminous as Alicia . Although the showier performance belongs to Crowe , it is Connelly 's complex work , depicting a woman torn by love for and fear of the same man , that elevates the film to a higher level \" . Connelly said afterward , \" [ A Beautiful Mind ] is the film I 'm really proud of and really love . \" A.O. Scott of The New York Times said , \" There is , for one thing , Ms. Connelly , keen and spirited in the underwritten role of a woman who starts out as a math groupie and soon finds herself the helpmeet of a disturbed , difficult man . \" In relation to previous roles , Connelly said : \" There was a period where I felt like I wasn 't quite being considered for the projects that I wanted to work on because maybe people were thinking . ' I 'm not going to cast the girl who was in that movie for this adult project . ' I 've felt for a long time that this is what I want to do so I 'm happy at this point to just take my time and work on projects that I feel really strongly about and the rest of the time just live my life . \" Connelly said that she became interested in Ang Lee 's Hulk ( 2003 ) because of his philosophical perspective on the Marvel Comics superhero . She played Betty Ross , a scientist and the former girlfriend of the main character , Bruce Banner . The film was a moderate success . It was followed the same year by House of Sand and Fog , a drama based on the novel by Andre Dubus III . She portrayed Kathy Nicolo , an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani ( Ben Kingsley ) . After reading the script , Connelly said : \" ( the story is ) moving and beautifully written . I liked the fact that there is no good guy and bad guy . I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable , because life is often like that . \" Producer Michael London said about Connelly 's portrayal : \" I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had . I don 't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace . \" The film received worldwide critical acclaim , with a BBC reporter commenting , \" [ Connelly ] convinces totally as a selfish , desperate and lonely woman who confesses to her brother , ' I just feel lost ' \" . = = = 2005 \u2013 present = = = After a two-year absence from the film scene , Connelly returned in the 2005 horror \/ psychological thriller Dark Water , which was based on a 2002 Japanese film of the same name . She played Dahlia , a frightened young woman traumatized by her past , who moves with her daughter to an apartment in New York City where paranormal happenings take place . In his review , critic Roger Ebert wrote , \" I cared about the Jennifer Connelly character ; she is not a horror heroine but an actress playing a mother faced with horror . There is a difference , and because of that difference , Dark Water works \" . She played Kathy Adamson in an adaptation of the novel Little Children alongside Kate Winslet , a movie which focuses on the relationship between Sarah Pierce ( played by Winslet ) and Brad Adamson ( Patrick Wilson ) . Connelly co-starred in Blood Diamond opposite Leonardo DiCaprio where she portrayed journalist Maddy Bowen , who is working on exposing the real story behind blood diamonds . New York praised her performance : \" Connelly is such a smart , sane , unhistrionic actress that she almost disguises the fact that her character is a wheeze . \" Both Little Children and Blood Diamond were nominated for multiple Academy Awards . Her next appearance was as Grace in the drama Reservation Road with Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo , a film released in 2007 . After her son dies in a hit-and-run , Grace gradually tries to overcome her grief , while her husband Ethan ( Joaquin Phoenix ) becomes obsessed with discovering who killed him . By her own account , the character she played in the movie proved tougher than any of her previous roles . USA Today 's Susan Wloszczyna commented , \" The strong performances of Jennifer Connelly and Mark Ruffalo ... raise the film above overheated melodrama \" . Parisian fashion house Balenciaga and Revlon cosmetics signed Connelly as the face of their 2008 campaigns . Connelly portrayed astrobiologist Helen Benson alongside Keanu Reeves in the 2008 remake of the 1951 science fiction film The Day The Earth Stood Still . Unlike the original movie , in which Benson was a secretary and her relationship with Klaatu was the focus , the remake featured Benson in a troubled relationship with her stepson , portrayed by Jaden Smith . This was followed by a role in the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That Into You , which also featured Jennifer Aniston and Ginnifer Goodwin . The film was based on the self-help book of the same name . Variety praised her portrayal : \" Despite its layer of darkness Connelly gives a really rich performance as a woman whose principles back her into a corner \" . In 2009 , she appeared in the costume drama biopic Creation , in which she played Emma Darwin , wife of Charles Darwin , opposite her real-life husband Paul Bettany . Set during the writing of On the Origin of Species , the movie depicts Darwin 's struggle with the subject of the book as well as with his wife , who opposed his theories , and their mourning for their daughter Annie . The San Francisco Chronicle wrote , \" Darwin 's wife , a religious woman who disapproved of her husband 's theories , is played by Jennifer Connelly , Bettany 's real-life wife , in the kind of casting that doesn 't always work , but it does here . We believe in the Darwins ' history together , their familiarity and affection . Connelly 's English accent is also as good as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger 's and Gwyneth Paltrow 's . She doesn 't get just the sounds right , but also the music and the attitude \" . She then voiced the character named \" 7 \" , an adventurous warrior in the animated film 9 . Dustin Lance Black 's Virginia premiered on September 15 , 2010 , at the Toronto International Film Festival .

She described the film as a \" very different \" and \" very personal \" independent film . According to Cinema Blend , \" Virginia is propped up by a strong central performance , with Connelly doing some of her best work in years \" . In 2011 , Connelly starred in Ron Howard 's comedy The Dilemma with Vince Vaughn . Although the Austin Chronicle 's review noted , \" Vaughn nails it , and his nicely nuanced everyguy performance is aided by the always-excellent Connelly , \" the movie opened to generally negative reviews .

        "doc": "Kevin Clash = Kevin Jeffrey Clash ( born September 17 , 1960 ) is an American puppeteer whose characters include Elmo , Clifford , Benny Rabbit , and Hoots the Owl . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , and began performing for local TV children 's shows in his hometown of Baltimore , Maryland , as a teenager . In the early 1980s , he began working in Captain Kangaroo , and began performing in Sesame Street in 1984 . He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo , the character he became the most famous for , and became an executive producer and director for the show . Clash worked in various productions for the Muppets and Jim Henson Productions and in other projects . He resigned from Sesame Street in late 2012 , after allegations of sexual impropriety , which he denied and were dismissed due to statute of limitations expiring . Clash wrote an autobiography , My Life as a Furry Red Monster , which was published in 2006 , and also featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = Early years = = Kevin Clash was born in Baltimore , Maryland , on September 17 , 1960 , the third of four children born to George Clash , a flash welder and handyman , and Gladys Clash , who ran a small daycare center in their two-bedroom , one-bath home in the Turner Station of Dundalk , Maryland . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , inspired by children 's shows like Kukla , Fran and Ollie and Sesame Street . He made his first puppet , a version of Mickey Mouse , at the age of 10 . When he was twelve , he created a monkey puppet out of the lining of his father 's coat . His first performances were for his mother 's daycare children . By the time he was a teenager , he had built almost 90 puppets , which he based upon commercials , popular music , and his friends . While still in high school , Clash performed at venues throughout Baltimore , including schools , churches , fundraisers , and community events . While appearing at a neighborhood festival , Clash was discovered by Baltimore television personality Stu Kerr , who became Clash 's first mentor and hired him to perform in the children 's show Caboose at Channel 2 . Clash also built puppets for the Romper Room franchise . When he was 17 , he contacted and met puppeteer Kermit Love , who became Clash 's mentor , after seeing Love featured in an episode of the documentary Call It Macaroni . In 1979 , on Love 's recommendation , Clash appeared as Cookie Monster in the Sesame Street float during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Parade , and met Jim Henson , who later became his boss , mentor , and friend . When he was nineteen , Clash became a puppeteer for Captain Kangaroo , initially as a guest performer , in which he also made occasional on-camera appearances . The producers of Captain Kangaroo used some of Clash 's puppet creations for the show . In 1984 , Clash had to turn down Henson 's offer to work on his film The Dark Crystal because he was working on two TV shows at the same time , Captain Kangaroo and Love 's syndicated program The Great Space Coaster , in which he was producer for the first time . = = Career = = Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons , and Great Space Coaster ended , freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street . Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983 , mostly performing nondescript , stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets . Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl ( based on Louis Armstrong ) , the infant Baby Natasha , and inventor Dr. Nobel Price . After 1985 , Elmo , a furry red monster , became his main character . Four puppeteers , including Richard Hunt , had performed Elmo previously , but it was Clash 's development , with a falsetto voice , that established the character . He based Elmo 's character on the preschool children that attended his mother 's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents . Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz , who told Clash to always \" find one special hook \" for each character . Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he \" should represent love \" . After the height of Elmo 's popularity , especially the \" Tickle Me Elmo \" craze in 1996 , Clash 's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased . He recruited , auditioned , and trained its puppeteers , and became the senior Muppet coordinator , a writer , director , and co-producer of the \" Elmo 's World \" segment of the show . Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street 's international co-productions . He found working with the co-productions \" a lot of fun \" and \" very rewarding \" . He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird . In 2007 , he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop . Until 2011 , he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances , making his schedule , as he called it , \" crazy \" . Cheryl Henson , president of the Jim Henson Foundation , called him \" essential \" to the show . Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , which was dedicated to Henson , in 1990 , voicing Master Splinter . He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions , including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour ( 1989 ) , and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz 's characters ( Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear , Sam the Eagle , and Animal ) in Muppet Treasure Island ( 1996 ) . Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space ( 1999 ) and The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz ( 2005 ) , and the TV series Muppets Tonight ( 1996 \u2014 1998 ) , in which he reprised Clifford , who served as the show 's host . He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs . In 1999 , Clash worked on a film starring Elmo , The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland . In 2006 , Clash published his autobiography , co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell , entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster : What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life , Love and Laughing Out Loud . His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = = Resignation from Sesame Workshop = = = In November 2012 , 23-year-old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Clash which began when Stephens was 16 . Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June , and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated . Clash acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser ; however , he characterized the relationship as being between consenting adults . Stephens later recanted his accusation , but two weeks later , another accuser , Cecil Singleton , made similar accusations and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Clash . Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20 , 2012 , and released a statement saying , \" Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work ' Sesame Street ' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer . I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately . \" Sesame Workshop also released a statement : \" Unfortunately , the controversy surrounding Kevin 's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want , and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from ' Sesame Street . ' \" They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash 's understudy and would take over his roles on the show . In July 2013 , the three cases against Clash were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash 's alleged violations during the three years after each turned 21 . Clash 's lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life . Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling , alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse weren 't fully realized until 2012 . In April 2014 , the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals . Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations , Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash , but the case ultimately was dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had ended . = = Personal life = = Clash was married for 17 years , and has a daughter who was born in 1993 . In November 2012 , Clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from the Sesame Workshop , stating , \" I am a gay man . I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter . \" Clash is African American and has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo , African-American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him . He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work , and that it came through in his performances . = = Awards and honors = = Clash won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in a Children 's Series for his work as Elmo on Sesame Street in 1990 , 2005 \u2013 2007 and 2009 \u2013 2013 . In all , he has won 27 daytime Emmys and one prime-time Emmy . He was the first recipient of the ' Miss Jean ' Worthley Award for Service to Families and Children given by Maryland Public Television on June 9 , 2007 . On May 19 , 2012 , Clash was presented with an honorary degree from Washington & Jefferson College .",

        "doc": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A. Richardson , Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Sanborn Contracts- 1874 ) ( Resigned and appointed Federal Judge by Grant . ) George H. Williams , Attorney General \u2013 ( Pratt & Boyd- 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Columbus Delano , Secretary of Interior \u2013 ( Bogus Agents \u2013 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Orville E. Babcock , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Black Friday \u2013 1869 ) ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Safe Burglary Conspiracy \u2013 1876 ) ( Acquitted in Saint Louis Whiskey Ring trials by jury due to Grant 's defense testimony in his favor . ) John McDonald , Internal Revenue Supervisor , St. Louis \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Indicted and convicted ; served prison time ; claimed Grant was involved in the Whiskey Ring but did not supply any evidence . ) Horace Porter , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) William W. Belknap , Secretary of War \u2013 ( Trading Post Ring- 1876 ) ( Resigned ; Convicted by House ; acquitted by Senate ; indictments against Belknap in Washington D.C. court were dropped by judge at request of Grant and Attorney General Alphonso Taft . ) George M. Robeson , Secretary of Navy \u2013 ( Naval Department Ring- 1876 ) ( Grant defended Robeson in State of the Union address . Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P. Bradley \u2013 1870 Ward Hunt \u2013 1873 Morrison Remick Waite ( Chief Justice ) \u2013 1874 = = = States admitted to the Union = = = Colorado \u2013 August 1 , 1876 Colorado came into the Union just in time to give enough electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

        "document": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War. Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872, serving from March 4, 1869, to March 4, 1877. Grant was a Republican, and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions. The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era, and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873, a severe national depression, that dominated Grant 's second term."

        "doc": "Georgetown Hoyas = The Georgetown Hoyas are the athletics teams that officially represent Georgetown University in college sports . Part of the NCAA 's Division I , the Hoyas field 23 varsity level sports teams , most of which participate in the Big East Conference , with the exception of the Division I FCS Patriot League in football . In late 2012 , Georgetown and six other Catholic , non-FBS schools announced that they were departing the Big East for a new conference . The rowing and sailing teams also participate in east coast conferences . The men 's basketball team is the school 's most famous and most successful program , but Hoyas have achieved success in a wide range of sports . The team name is derived from the mixed Greek and Latin chant , \" Hoya Saxa , \" ( meaning \" What Rocks \" ) which gained popularity at the school in the late nineteenth century . The name Hoyas came into use in the 1920s . Most teams have their athletic facilities on the main campus of Georgetown University . The men 's basketball team plays most of their home games at the Verizon Center in downtown Washington , D.C. and the baseball team plays at Shirley Povich Field in Cabin John , Maryland . Lee Reed took over as the school 's athletic director in April 2010 . = = Traditions = = = = = The word \" hoya \" = = = The University admits that the precise origin of the term \" Hoya \" is unknown . At some point before 1893 , students well-versed in classical languages combined the Greek hoia or hoya , meaning \" what \" or \" such \" , and the Latin saxa to form Hoya Saxa ! , or \" What Rocks ! \" This cheer may either refer to the stalwart defense of the football team , or to the baseball team , which was nicknamed the \" Stonewalls \" , or to the actual stone wall that surrounds the campus . After World War I , the term \" Hoya \" was increasingly used on campus , including for the newspaper and the school mascot . In 1920 , students began publishing the campus 's first sports newspaper under the name The Hoya , after successfully petitioning the Dean of the College to use it instead of the proposed name , The Hilltopper . \" Hilltoppers \" was also a name sometimes used for the sports teams . By the fall of 1928 , the newspaper had taken to referring to the sports teams as the Hoyas . This was influenced by a popular half time show at football games , where the mascot , a dog nicknamed \" Hoya , \" would entertain fans . Georgetown 's unique team name has caused opponents to mock Georgetown with chants including \" What 's a Hoya ? \" Harrison High School , located in Kennesaw , Georgia , is the only other institution in the country licensed to share this name . However , Georgetown Preparatory School , which separated from the University in 1927 , uses the name \" Little Hoyas \" for its sports teams and shares the University 's blue and gray color scheme . = = = Mascot = = = Georgetown 's nickname is The Hoyas , but its mascot is \" Jack the Bulldog . \" Various breeds of dogs have been used by the sports teams as mascots since the early 1900s . Several notable bull terriers like Sergeant Stubby and \" Hoya \" were used at football games in the 1920s , as was a Great Dane in the 1940s . However , in 1951 , the school suspended its football program because of the increasing cost of the game financially and academically , which left the school without an official live mascot . In 1964 , the school permitted exhibition football games to resume , and students financed the purchase of a young English bulldog named Royal Jacket , whom they intended to rename \" Hoya \" , but he only responded to the callname \" Jack \" . This breed was chosen to represent the school because of their \" tenacity . \" The athletics department subsequently adopted as its logo a drawing of a bulldog sporting a blue and gray freshman beanie . The original Jack retired in 1967 , but the name was carried over to his successors . In 1977 , the university began the tradition of dressing up a student in a blue and gray bulldog costume , replacing the live bulldog , though several dogs periodically joined the costumed mascot during the 1980s and 1990s . In 1999 , Scott R. Pilarz , S.J. , with the help of the Hoya Blue fan club , revived the tradition of an official live bulldog named Jack , to work along with the costumed mascot . When Pilarz left for the University of Scranton in 2003 , taking Jack with him , Georgetown secured a new bulldog puppy and found another Jesuit , Christopher Steck , S.J. , to care for him . The current bulldog is named \" John S. Carroll , \" a play on the name of Georgetown 's founder , which name allows for continuation of the \" Jack the Bulldog \" nickname . After Jack injured his leg in 2012 , two Georgetown parents donated a younger bulldog puppy , who the school refers to as \" Jack Jr . \" = = = Colors = = = Blue and gray are the official colors of Georgetown University and its athletic teams . The colors are an important reminder of the school 's past . During the American Civil War , Prussian blue was commonly used in Union uniforms , while cadet grey was used in Confederate uniforms . These colors were introduced by the rowing team in 1876 , who deemed blue and gray \" appropriate colors for the [ Boat ] Club and expressive of the feeling of unity between the Northern and Southern boys of the College . \" Girls from neighboring Georgetown Visitation sewed the original uniforms together for the team and presented the Boat Club with a blue and gray banner reading \" Ocior Euro \" ( Swifter than the Wind ) . The basketball and lacrosse teams use gray as their primary color in home jerseys , with blue in away jerseys . White is also frequently used as an accent to these colors , and is actually the main color in the football and baseball teams ' away jerseys and the soccer team 's home jerseys . Campus spirit groups often encourage students to \" bleed Hoya blue , \" a slogan used on teeshirts and bumper stickers sold to fans . Fans are generally encouraged to wear gray to home games , and sellouts are referred to as a \" gray out . \" Though various shades are used , the primary ones suggested by the school 's identification policy are pantone 409 and pantone 282 , which is the same shade as Oxford Blue . = = = Fight song = = = The Georgetown Fight Song , known as \" There Goes Old Georgetown \" , is actually an amalgamation of three songs , only the oldest of which , 1913 's \" The Touchdown Song \" , contains the lyric \" here goes old Georgetown \" . Students combined a version of \" The Touchdown Song \" with \" Cheer for Victory \" , written in 1915 , and \" The Hoya Song \" , written in 1930 , both of which are included in their entirety . The authors of these songs , and of the combined version , are unknown . Georgetown 's fight song is rare among U.S. university fight songs for mentioning other colleges by name . Specifically , it mentions Yale University , Harvard University , Princeton University , College of the Holy Cross , the United States Naval Academy , and Cornell University , who were all rivals of Georgetown in the early to mid-20th century , and mocks their fight songs . In recent years the Hoyas only play Cornell and Holy Cross regularly ( in football ) , and many of these schools no longer use the fight songs that Georgetown 's song mocks . = = Varsity sports = = Georgetown University fields 23 varsity level sports teams , 11 men 's teams , 11 women 's teams , and one co-ed team . Intercollegiate sports include ( inaugural season in parentheses ) : Men 's : baseball ( 1870 ) , basketball ( 1907 ) , crew ( 1876 ; 1958 ) , cross country ( 1924 ) , football ( 1887 ) , golf ( 1925 ) , lacrosse ( 1951 ) , soccer ( 1952 ) , swimming and diving ( 1949 ) , tennis ( 1920 ) , and track and field ( 1891 ) Women 's : basketball ( 1960 ) , crew ( 1975 ) , cross country ( 1976 ) , field hockey ( 1960 ) , golf ( 2001 ) , lacrosse ( 1975 ) , soccer ( 1991 ) , softball ( 2005 ) , swimming and diving ( 1975 ) , tennis ( 1960 ) , track and field ( 1976 ) , and volleyball ( 1960 ) Coed : sailing ( 1937 ) = = = Basketball = = = The Georgetown University men 's basketball team is perhaps the most well-known Hoya program . Georgetown 's first intercollegiate men 's basketball team was formed in 1907 . John Thompson III , son of the accomplished Hoyas coach John Thompson , is the current head coach . The Hoyas historically have been well regarded not only for their team success , but also for their ability to generate players that after graduation succeed both on the court , such as Patrick Ewing , and off , such as Paul Tagliabue and Henry Hyde . The team has reached the NCAA Tournament Final Four five times including the 1984 national championship , and has won the Big East Tournament seven times , and has also won or shared the Big East regular season title seven times . The women 's basketball also plays in the Big East Conference , and are coached by Terri Williams-Flournoy . The team was first formed in 1970 , and joined the Big East in 1983 . They play their home games on campus at McDonough Gymnasium . The women 's team so far has not seen the same success as the men 's , and have only been invited to the NCAA tournament three times , reaching the Sweet Sixteen in 1993 and 2011 , and the second round in 2010 . They have been invited to the Women 's National Invitation Tournament , five times , progressing furthest in 2009 by reaching the fourth round . = = = Rowing = = = Rowing at Georgetown has a distinguished history dating back to the founding of the Boat Club in 1876 . The team was however suspended from 1909 to 1920 due to lack of interest , and involvement in World War I. Georgetown added a men 's lightweight team in 1963 , a women 's team in 1975 , and a women 's lightweight team in 1996 . The men have won 5 national championships at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta , the most recent being the men 's varsity lightweight fours with coxswain on June 5 , 2016 . The first national championship win was in 1991 with the varsity heavyweight fours with coxswain . Under the guidance of coaches Tony Johnson and Steve Full , Georgetown competes as a member of the top leagues in American rowing , the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges and Eastern Association of Women 's Rowing Colleges . Georgetown 's four crew teams have seen success in recent years , including trips to the Henley Royal Regatta and entry into the Eastern Sprints for the men 's heavyweight and lightweight teams and second-in-the-nation finishes for both men 's and women 's lightweight teams . Many Georgetown oarsmen and -women have gone on to represent the United States on national and Olympic teams . The lightweight women 's team has earned bronze medals at Women 's Eastern Sprints in the Lightweight Women 's Varsity 8 + in 2013 and the Lightweight Women 's Varsity 4 + in 2015 . The LW8 + crew earning bronze in 2013 was later named Row2k Crew of the Week . The university rents space in Thompson Boat Center , though it has ongoing plans to build a new boathouse closer to campus . For land workouts , Georgetown rowers have access to the Rowing Training Center , a refurbished storeroom beneath the Leavey Center that was repurposed into an erg room in 2013 ( its underground , windowless location has inspired numerous nicknames such as the \" Thunder Dungeon \" ) . Notable Georgetown crew alumni include walk-on Mike Vespoli , the founder and chief executive officer of Vespoli USA , Inc. as well as actor Bradley Cooper . = = = Sailing = = = The sailing team competes in the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association ( MAISA ) of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association ( ICSA ) . Under coach Mike Callahan has been ranked number 1 nationally in the ICSA Sailing World College Rankings on multiple occasions . The team sails from the Washington Sailing Marina Andrew Campbell was named U.S. Olympic Committee ( USOC ) Male Sailing Athlete of the Year in 2002 and 2005 , and ICSA College Sailor of the Year in 2006 . He is one of the six team members awarded as College Sailors of the Year on seven occasions , as Nevin Snow has taken the prize twice , in 2015 and 2016 . Campbell helped lead the team to the first of their 13 Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association National Championships since 2001 , and are the reigning national co-ed champions as of 2016 . During this time the team also won seven MAISA conference championships , known as the America Trophy . After the team 's 2013 national championship , they were invited to participate in the 2014 World University Match Racing Championships in Trentino , Italy , on Lago di Ledro , which they won 7 \u2013 1 , besting nineteen teams from fourteen countries . The Hoyas won the Leonard M. Fowle Trophy to the best overall collegiate team in 2006 . = = = Soccer = = = The men 's soccer team was organized in 1952 , and have made four NCAA Tournament appearances , in 1994 , 1997 , 2010 , and 2012 . They play in the Big East Conference , and have made it to the Big East Tournament 19 times , and advanced to the finals in 2012 . They are coached by Brian Wiese , and play their home games on campus at North Kehoe Field . The women 's soccer team began play in 1991 , have been coached by Dave Nolan since 1999 , and share the same home field . The women 's team has been to the NCAA Tournament twice , in 2007 and 2010 , when they advanced to the quarterfinals . Six players from the men 's soccer team have played professionally for Major League Soccer : Phil Wellington ( drafted in 1996 ) , Brandon Leib ( 1997 ) , Eric Kvello ( 1999 ) , Dan Gargan 2004 ( Selected 43rd overall in the 2005 MLS Supplemental Draft ) , Jeff Curtin 2005 ( 1st round draft Pick # 14 overall ) , and Steve Neumann 2014 ( 1st round draft pick in 2014 MLS SuperDraft , 4th overall pick ) . Ricky Schramm , who played on the 2006 Hoyas , was drafted in the 3rd round by D.C. United . Women 's team star Ingrid Wells has played on the United States U-23 women 's national soccer team and for G\u00f6teborg FC . = = = Lacrosse = = = Both the men 's and women 's lacrosse teams have been highly competitive in recent years , both in conference and tournament play . A men 's lacrosse team was first organized in 1951 , and entered Division 1 play in 1970 . The team played in the Eastern College Athletic Conference until the 2010 season , when the Big East Conference created a men 's league . The men 's team made the NCAA Tournament each season from 1996 \u2013 2007 , reaching the Final Four in 1999 . The women 's lacrosse team was formed in 1977 , and won the first 6 consecutive Big East titles from 2001 \u2013 2006 . The Lady Hoyas reached the NCAA Women 's Lacrosse Championship final in both 2001 and 2002 . In 2005 , their first season under new coach Ricky Fried , the team went 13 \u2013 5 and made the NCAA Tournament for the 8th straight year . Both the men 's and women 's teams play their home games on Multi-Sport Field . = = = Football = = = The football team at Georgetown was first formed on November 1 , 1874 , with the earliest recorded games dating to 1887 . By the 1940s , Georgetown had one of the better college football teams in America , and played in the 1941 Orange Bowl , where they lost 14 \u2013 7 to Mississippi State . As the college game became more expensive after World War II , however , Georgetown 's program began to lose money rapidly . The Hoyas last successful season was 1949 , when they lost in the Sun Bowl against Texas Western . However the program was losing too much money , and on March 22 , 1951 , the university 's president canceled the football program . In 1964 , Georgetown allowed its students to start a football program as an exhibition-only club sport . Varsity football resumed in 1970 at what later became known as the Division III level . Today , Georgetown plays at the Division I Football Championship Subdivision , competing in the Patriot League and perennially plays against Ivy League schools . The Hoyas have also begun a cross-town rivalry with Howard University for a championship known as the D.C. Cup . \" Big Jim \" Ricca , an NFL defensive end and offensive lineman , graduated in 1949 and was the last Hoya to play in an NFL game . In 2007 , the Washington Redskins made Alex Buzbee a reserve player , becoming the first Georgetown player on an NFL team since Ricca retired in 1956 . The 2011 Georgetown Football team finished 8-3 , which was their first winning season since the 1999 campaign , giving them a second place in the conference . = = = Track and field = = = Georgetown has been nationally successful in both cross country and track and field . The men and women 's track and field teams practice off-campus at Duke Ellington Track in neighboring Burleith . The men 's and women 's teams have both been ranked # 1 by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association in recent years , both nationally and in the Mid-Atlantic Region . In 2011 , the women 's cross country program won Georgetown 's only other team NCAA Championship by besting Big East rival Villanova . Chris Miltenberg , women 's cross country coach , won the 2011 NCAA coach of the year for women 's cross country . Patrick Henner is the director of men 's and women 's track and field as of 2012 . Georgetown track and field has won 21 individual NCAA National Championships , being 15 by male athletes and 6 by female athletes . The first individual NCAA National Champion was Charles Capozzoli in cross country in 1952 . To date , there have also been 11 National Champions in indoor and 9 National Champions in outdoor NCAA track and field championships . = = = Baseball = = = Baseball is Georgetown 's oldest sport , with the first recorded game taking place in 1866 , and the team formally organized and sanctioned in 1870 . The Hoyas have seen little national success , with no appearances in the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship since the event was established in 1947 . The team was once known as the Stonewalls , and is one possible source of the Hoya Saxa cheer famous among all Georgetown sports teams . The Hoyas play their home games at Shirley Povich Field , a 1,500 seat stadium located in Bethesda , Maryland and named for Washington Post sports columnist Shirley Povich . The stadium was built in 2000 . The Hoyas also utilize three lighted batting cages and two bullpen areas located on campus above Yates Field House , and adjacent to Kehoe Field . = = = Golf = = = The men 's golf team has won two Big East Conference championships : 1998 and 2010 .

        "doc": "George Kenney = George Churchill Kenney ( 6 August 1889 \u2013 9 August 1977 ) was a United States Army Air Forces general during World War II . He is best known as the commander of the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , a position he held from August 1942 until 1945 . Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the Aviation Section , U.S. Signal Corps in 1917 , and served on the Western Front with the 91st Aero Squadron . He was awarded a Silver Star and the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in which he fought off German fighters and shot two down . After hostilities ended he participated in the Occupation of the Rhineland . Returning to the United States , he flew reconnaissance missions along the border between the US and Mexico during the Mexican Revolution . Commissioned into the Regular Army in 1920 , he attended the Air Corps Tactical School , and later became an instructor there . He was responsible for the acceptance of Martin NBS-1 bombers built by Curtis , and test flew them . He also developed techniques for mounting .30 caliber machine guns on the wings of an Airco DH.4 aircraft . In early 1940 , Kenney became Assistant Military Attach\u00e9 for Air in France . As a result of his observations of German and Allied air operations during the early stages of World War II , he recommended significant changes to Air Corps equipment and tactics . In July 1942 , he assumed command of the Allied Air Forces and Fifth Air Force in General Douglas MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific Area . Under Kenney 's command , the Allied Air Forces developed innovative command structures , weapons , and tactics that reflected Kenney 's orientation towards attack aviation . The new weapons and tactics won perhaps his greatest victory , the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , in March 1943 . In June 1944 he was appointed commander of the Far East Air Forces ( FEAF ) , which came to include the Fifth , Thirteenth , and Seventh Air Forces . In April 1946 , Kenney became the first commander of the newly formed Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) , but his performance in the role was criticized , and he was shifted to become commander of the Air University , a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951 . = = Early life = = George Churchill Kenney was born in Yarmouth , Nova Scotia , Canada , on 6 August 1889 , during a summer vacation taken by his parents to avoid the humidity of the Boston area . The oldest of four children of carpenter Joseph Atwood Kenney and his wife Anne Louise Kenney , n\u00e9e Churchill , Kenney grew up in Brookline , Massachusetts . He graduated from Brookline High School in 1907 and later that year he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , where he pursued a course in civil engineering . After his father left his family , Kenney quit MIT and took various jobs before becoming a surveyor for the Quebec Saguenay Railroad . His mother died in 1913 and Kenney returned to Boston , where he took a job with Stone & Webster . In 1914 he joined the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad as a civil engineer , building a bridge in New London , Connecticut . After this was completed , he formed a partnership , the Beaver Contracting and Engineering Corporation , with a high school classmate , Gordon Glazier . The firm became involved in a number of projects , including the construction of a seawall at Winthrop , Massachusetts , and a bridge over the Squannacook River . = = World War I = = The United States entered World War I in April 1917 , and Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the Aviation Section , U.S. Signal Corps on 2 June 1917 . He attended ground school at MIT in June and July , and received primary flight training at Hazelhurst Field in Mineola , New York , from Bert Acosta . He was commissioned as a first lieutenant on 5 November 1917 , and departed for France soon after . There , he received further flight training at Issoudun . This ended in February 1918 , when he was assigned to the 91st Aero Squadron . The 91st Aero Squadron flew the Salmson 2A2 , a reconnaissance biplane . Kenney crashed one on takeoff on 22 March 1918 . He broke an ankle and a hand , and earned himself the nickname \" Bust ' em up George \" . His injuries soon healed , and he recorded his first mission on 3 June . Kenney flew one of four aircraft on a mission near Gorze on 15 September 1918 that was attacked by six German Pfalz D.III scouts . His observer shot one of them down , and Kenney was credited with his first aerial victory . For this he was awarded a Silver Star . A second victory followed in similar circumstances on 9 October while he was flying near Jametz in support of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive . Once again , the formation he was flying with was attacked by German fighters . This time he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross , which was presented by Brigadier General Billy Mitchell on 10 January 1919 . Kenney 's citation read : For extraordinary heroism in action near Jametz , France , October 9 , 1918 . This officer gave proof of his bravery and devotion to duty when he was attacked by a superior number of aircraft . He accepted combat , destroyed one plane and drove the others off . Notwithstanding that the enemy returned and attacked again in strong numbers , he continued his mission and enabled his observer to secure information of great military value . Kenney remained for a time with the Allied occupation forces in Germany , and was promoted to captain on 18 March 1919 . He returned to the United States in June 1919 . He was sent to Kelly Field , near San Antonio , Texas , and then to McAllen , Texas . As commander of the 8th Aero Squadron , he flew reconnaissance missions along the border with Mexico during the Mexican Revolution . Poor aircraft maintenance , rough landing strips and bad weather led to the squadron losing 22 of its 24 Airco DH.4 aircraft in just one year . = = Between the wars = = Kenney applied for one of a number of Regular Army commissions offered to reservists after the war , and was commissioned as a captain in the Air Service on 1 July 1920 . While he was in hospital in Texas recovering from an aviation accident , he met a nurse , Helen \" Hazel \" Dell Richardson , the daughter of a Mobile , Alabama , contractor , George W. Richardson . They were married in Mobile on 6 October 1920 . Hazel miscarried twins , and was warned by her doctor of the danger of another pregnancy , but she strongly wished to have a child . In 1922 , while the couple was living on Long Island , New York , a son , William Richardson Kenney , was born to them , but Hazel died soon afterward from complications . Kenney arranged to have the infant cared for by his neighbor , Alice Steward Maxey , another nurse . On 5 June 1923 Kenney married Maxey in her home town of Gardiner , Maine . From July to November 1920 , Kenney was air detachment commander at Camp Knox , Kentucky . He then became a student at the Air Service Engineering School at McCook Field , near Dayton Ohio . He was the Air Service Inspector at the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in Garden City , New York , where he was responsible for the acceptance of the fifty Martin NBS-1 bombers that the Air Service had ordered from Curtis between 1921 and 1923 . Kenney inspected the aircraft , and test flew them . While there , he was reduced in rank from captain to first lieutenant on 18 November 1922 , a common occurrence in the aftermath of World War I when the wartime army was demobilized . He returned to McCook in 1923 , and developed techniques for mounting .30 caliber machine guns on the wings of a DH.4. He was promoted to captain again on 3 November 1923 . His daughter , Julia Churchill Kenney , was born in Dayton in June 1926 . In 1926 , Kenney became a student at the Air Corps Tactical School , at Langley Field , Virginia , the Air Corps ' advanced training school . He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , the Army 's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers . Most Air Corps officers , including Kenney , considered the course largely irrelevant to them , and therefore a waste of time , but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army . Afterwards , he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor . He taught classes of attack aviation . He was particularly interested in low-level attacks , as a means of improving accuracy . There were tactical problems with this , as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire . There were also technical problems to be solved , as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments . His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking . Kenney reached the pinnacle of his professional education in September 1932 , when he entered the Army War College in Washington , D.C .. At the war college , committees of students studied a number of World War I battles ; Kenney 's committee examined the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes . They updated actual war plans , Kenney 's study group working on War Plan Orange . They also had to write an individual paper ; Kenney wrote his on \" The Proper Composition of the Air Force \" . One benefit of the Army War College was that it brought Air Corps officers into contact with ground officers that they would later have to work closely with . Members of Kenney 's class included Richard Sutherland and Stephen Chamberlain , both of whom worked with him on committees . Graduation from the Army War College was normally followed by a staff posting , and on graduation in June 1933 Kenney became an assistant to Major James E. Chaney in the Plans Division of the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps , Major General Benjamin Foulois . He performed various duties , including translating an article by the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet into English . In 1934 , he was involved with drafting legislation that granted the Air Corps a greater degree of independence . This legislation prompted the Army to create GHQ Air Force , a centralized , air force-level command headed by an aviator answering directly to the Army Chief of Staff . Lieutenant Colonel Frank M. Andrews was chosen to command it , and selected Kenney as his Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans and Training . In this role , Kenney was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel on 2 March 1935 , skipping that of major . He became involved in an acrimonious debate with the Army General Staff over the Air Corps ' desire to purchase more Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers . He also became caught up in a bureaucratic battle between Andrews and Major General Oscar Westover over whether the Chief of the Air Corps should control GHQ Air Force . As a result , Kenney was transferred to the Infantry School at Fort Benning , Georgia , on 16 June 1936 , with the temporary rank of major , to teach tactics to young infantry officers . He was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 October 1937 , but the assignment was hardly a choice one for an Air Corps officer . In September 1938 he accepted an offer to command the 97th Observation Squadron at Mitchell Field , New York . = = World War II = = In 1939 , Kenney was made Chief of the Production Engineering Section at Wright Field , Ohio . He was sent to France in early 1940 , once again with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel , as Assistant Military Attach\u00e9 for Air . His mission was to observe Allied air operations during the early stages of World War II . As a result of his observations , he recommended many important changes to Air Corps equipment and tactics , including upgrading armament from .30 caliber to .50 caliber machine guns , and installing leak-proof fuel tanks , but his scathing comparisons of the German Luftwaffe with the Air Corps upset many officers . This resulted in his being sent back to Wright Field . In January 1941 , he became commander of the Air Corps Experimental Depot and Engineering School there , with the rank of brigadier general . He was promoted to major general on 26 March 1942 , when he became commander of the Fourth Air Force , an air defense and training organization based in San Francisco . Kenney personally instructed pilots on how to handle the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and A-29 Hudson . = = = Southwest Pacific Area = = = In July 1942 , Kenney received orders to take over the Allied Air Forces and Fifth Air Force in General Douglas MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific Area . MacArthur had been dissatisfied with the performance of his air commander , Lieutenant General George Brett . Andrews , by then a major general , turned down the job , and , offered a choice between Kenney and Major General James Doolittle , MacArthur chose Kenney . Kenney reported to MacArthur in Brisbane on 28 July 1942 , and was treated to \" a lecture for approximately an hour on the shortcomings of the Air Force in general , and the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific in particular . \" Kenney felt that MacArthur did not understand air operations , but recognized that he somehow needed to establish a good working relationship with him . When he asked MacArthur for authority to send people he considered \" deadwood \" home , something that his superiors in Washington , D.C. had refused to give , MacArthur enthusiastically approved . Building a good relationship with MacArthur meant getting past Sutherland , MacArthur 's chief of staff . Brett advised Kenney that \" a showdown early in the game with Sutherland might clarify the entire atmosphere . \" Sutherland , who had a civil pilot 's license , had taken to issuing detailed instructions to the Allied Air Forces . This was more than simply a turf battle ; to many airmen , it was a part of the ongoing battle for an independent air force that they had long been advocating . At one point , Kenney drew a dot on a plain page of paper and told Sutherland , \" the dot represents what you know about air operations , the entire rest of the paper what I know . \" Sutherland backed down , and would henceforth let Kenney run the Allied Air Forces without interference . It did not follow , however , that MacArthur would invariably accept Kenney 's advice . Kenney sent home Major General Ralph Royce , Brigadier Generals Edwin S. Perrin , Albert Sneed and Martin Scanlon , and about forty colonels . In Australia , he found two talented , recently arrived brigadier generals , Ennis Whitehead and Kenneth Walker . Kenney reorganized his command in August , appointed Whitehead as commander of the V Fighter Command and Walker as commander of the V Bomber Command . The Allied Air Forces was composed of both United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) and Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) personnel . Kenney moved to separate them . Brigadier General Donald Wilson arrived in September and replaced Air Vice Marshal William Bostock as Kenney 's chief of staff . Bostock took over the newly created RAAF Command . This brought Kenney into conflict with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF , Air Vice Marshal George Jones , who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify the administration of the RAAF . Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command , and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance , was happy to leave arrangements the way they were . However , Kenney deviated from the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon ( ADVON ) under Whitehead . The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area , where fast-changing weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia . Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942 . Perhaps because of his experience in World War I , Kenney had a great deal of respect for Japanese fighters . He decided to conserve his bombers , and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea . Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided . SWPA had a low priority , and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions . What he needed was an effective long-range fighter , and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill , but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems . Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft . The Southwest Pacific was not a promising theater of war for the strategic bomber . The bombers of the day did not have the range to reach Japan from Australia , and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries . This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney , an attack aviator , and Walker , the bomber advocate . The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers . With sufficient mass , so the theory went , bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs , and do so from above the effective range of the ship 's anti-aircraft fire . However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific . A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together , owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable . The results were therefore generally ineffective , and operations incurred heavy casualties . Walker resisted Kenney 's proposals that the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses . Kenney ordered Walker to try the fuses for a couple of months , so that data could be gained about their effectiveness ; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use . In November , Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth , a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice . After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage . As expected , none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck , but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water , so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship . Walker reluctantly conceded the point . A few weeks later , Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul , an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night . In addition to trying different types of ordnance , the Allied Air Forces experimented with modifications to the aircraft themselves. the Major Paul I. \" Pappy \" Gunn modified some USAAF Douglas A-20 Havoc light bombers by installing four .50 in ( 12.7 mm ) machine guns in their noses , and two 450-US-gallon ( 1,700 l ; 370 imp gal ) fuel tanks were added to give the aircraft more range . This was successful , and an attempt was then made to create a longer range attack aircraft by doing the same thing to a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber , to operate as a \" commerce destroyer \" . This proved to be somewhat more difficult . The resulting aircraft was obviously nose heavy despite adding lead ballast to the tail , and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft . The tail guns and belly turrets were removed , the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low . The Allied Air Forces also adopted innovative tactics . In February 1942 , the RAAF began experimenting with skip bombing , an anti-shipping technique used by the British and Germans . Flying only a few dozen feet above the sea toward their targets , aircraft would release their bombs , which would then , ideally , ricochet across the surface of the water and explode at the side of the target ship , under it , or just over it . A similar technique was mast-height bombing , in which bombers would approach the target at low altitude , 200 to 500 feet ( 61 to 152 m ) , at about 265 to 275 miles per hour ( 426 to 443 km \/ h ) , and then drop down to mast height , 10 to 15 feet ( 3.0 to 4.6 m ) about 600 yards ( 550 m ) from the target . They would release their bombs at around 300 yards ( 270 m ) , aiming directly at the side of the ship . The two techniques were not mutually exclusive . A bomber could drop two bombs , skipping the first and launching the second at mast height . The Battle of the Bismarck Sea demonstrated the effectiveness of low-level attacks on shipping . Another form of airpower employed by Kenney was air transport . This started in September 1942 when troops of the 32nd Infantry Division were airlifted from Australia to Port Moresby . Later in the campaign , C-47 Dakotas landed Australian troops at Wanigela . A year later , American paratroops landed at Nadzab , enabling the Australian 7th Division to be flown in . The ultimate challenge was to integrate air power with MacArthur 's strategy . Kenney described the process this way in 1944 : The first step in this advancement of the bomber line is to gain and maintain air control as far into enemy territory as our longest range fighters can reach . Then we put an air blockade around the Jap positions or section of the coast which we want in order to stop him from getting supplies or reinforcements . The bombers then go to work and pulverize his defensive system , methodically taking out artillery positions , stores , bivouac areas and so on . Finally comes the air cover escorting the amphibious expedition to the landing beach , a last minute blasting and smoking of the enemy beach defenses and the maintenance of strafers and fighters overhead , on call from the surface forces until their beachhead is secured . If emergency supplies are needed we drop them by parachute . The ground troops get a transport field ready as fast as possible so that we can supplement boat supply by cargo carrying airplanes . When necessary , we evacuate the wounded and sick and bring in reinforcements in a hurry . The transport field becomes a fighter field , the strafers and finally the heavies arrive and it is time to move forward again . = = = Far East Air Forces = = = In June 1944 , Kenney was appointed commander of the Far East Air Forces ( FEAF ) , which came to include the Fifth , Thirteenth , and Seventh Air Forces . He created the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in forward areas , each for a specific mission , another departure from doctrine . While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation , Washington did not like it and , over Kenney 's objections , converted the three air task forces into the 308th , 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings . He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945 . Kenney hoped to get Boeing B-29 Superfortresses assigned to the Far East Air Forces so that , based from airfields near Darwin , they could destroy the Japanese oilfields at Balikpapan . His agitation for the B-29s did not endear him to the USAAF staff in Washington , D.C. After the war , the Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that this would have been far more productive than Operation Matterhorn , which saw B-29s based in China to bomb steel plants in Japan , as oil was more critical to the Japanese war effort than steel . = = = War crimes accusation = = = On 4 March 1943 , during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and aircraft to attack Japanese rescue vessels , as well as the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea . This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service . These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907 , which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances . = = Post-war career = = In April 1946 , Kenney became the first commander of the newly formed Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) . He was encouraged by Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington to join him in the political battle surrounding the establishment of an independent United States Air Force . Separately , the two men gave promotional speeches around the country . As a result , SAC 's efficiency suffered . On 8 May 1946 , Kenney publicly presented the Medal of Honor to the family of Thomas B. McGuire , Jr , the second-highest scoring US fighter pilot , who had been killed in action . Kenney left day-to-day operations at SAC in the hands of his deputy commander , Major General St. Clair Streett . Part of the reason for Kenney 's lack of focus on SAC was also his assignment as U.S. representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee , which appeared at that time to be potentially an important assignment . In January 1947 , Streett was replaced by Major General Clements McMullen . With McMullen serving officially as Kenney 's deputy but actually in command , a cross-training program was implemented in early 1948 to teach bomber crew members each other 's tasks , the goal being to reduce each bomber 's contingent of officers from five to three . Morale suffered as a result . Major General Lauris Norstad , responsible for reporting the readiness of American airpower to the U.S. Secretary of Defense , James Forrestal , heard from unhappy airmen that the SAC was in a poor state of readiness , and he initiated an investigation . He selected Charles Lindbergh and Paul Tibbets to perform the inquiry . Tibbets told Norstad that he found nobody at SAC knew their job . Lindbergh said that McMullen 's cross-training program \" seriously interfered with training the primary mission . \" On 6 May 1948 , Kenney spoke to a crowd in Bangor , Maine , telling them that the US was likely to be attacked by the Soviet Union as soon as the latter had enough atomic bombs . In Washington , D.C. , a group of senators including Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. complained of Kenney 's \" belligerent \" speech , and previous ones in the same vein by Symington , saying that matters of foreign policy should be left to the president and the secretary of state , not to leaders of the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . Another controversy that Kenney became embroiled in concerned the Convair B-36 Peacemaker . He was less than impressed with this expensive and under-performing aircraft , preferring the Boeing B-50 Superfortress , an upgraded version of the B-29 instead . The USAF , however , had staked much of its credibility on the B-36 , something that Kenney did not seem to appreciate . In the context of the Berlin Blockade in June 1948 , the Air Force Chief of Staff , General Hoyt S. Vandenberg met with Forrestal to report the poor state of SAC . Following this meeting , Norstad recommended that Vandenberg replace Kenney , and Vandenberg quickly agreed , choosing Lieutenant General Curtis LeMay as the man he would prefer to lead the strategic bombing arm in case of war with the USSR . LeMay was made leader of SAC , and Kenney became commander of the Air University , a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951 . = = Retirement = = After his retirement , he lived in Bay Harbor Islands , Florida . In 1958 he appeared as the host of the TV anthology series Flight . He died on 9 August 1977 . = = Books = = Kenney wrote three books about the SWPA air campaigns he led during World War II . His major work was General Kenney Reports ( 1949 ) , a personal history of the air war he led from 1942 to 1945 . He also wrote The Saga of Pappy Gunn ( 1959 ) and Dick Bong : Ace of Aces ( 1960 ) , which described the careers of Paul Gunn and Richard Bong , two of the most prominent airmen under his command . = = Family = = He was survived by his two children , five grandsons and one granddaughter . His stepson , William \" Bill \" R. Kenney , rose to the rank of colonel in the USAF . His daughter , Julia , earned a B.A. in English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1947 . In 1948 she married Edward C. Hoagland Jr . , a fighter pilot in World War II and later in Korea , who eventually retired from the USAF at the rank of lieutenant colonel . = = Awards = = During a career that spanned over 30 years , Kenney was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with one oak leaf cluster , the Distinguished Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster , the Silver Star Medal , the Distinguished Flying Cross , the Bronze Star Medal , the Purple Heart and several foreign decorations .",

        "doc": "Simon Favre = Simon Favre ( May 31 , 1760 \u2013 July 3 , 1813 ) was an interpreter of the Muskogean languages , particularly Choctaw and Chickasaw , for the French , British , Spanish and Americans in the part of West Florida that became part of the states of Mississippi and Alabama . The son of another prominent interpreter , Favre spent the late 18th century in the vicinity of Mobile and the Tombigbee River , which changed hands from French to British , and then Spanish control . He became well versed in the language and culture of the Choctaws , and was involved with several treaties between the Europeans and natives . As a young man he had a Chocktaw mistress with whom he had six known children , then at the age of 41 he was legally married in Mobile to a woman of European descent . Within a few years of his marriage , he moved with his new family from the Tombigbee area to a plantation on the Pearl River . As the power of the Choctaws diminished , Favre became less important as an interpreter , and more important as a facilitator of the political changes occurring along the Gulf Coast . Once the Louisiana Purchase was concluded between France and the United States , American settlers from both inside and outside Spanish West Florida increased pressure on Spain for American control of the territory . While the transfer did not officially take place until 1821 , the Spanish essentially put Florida under the trust of the United States in 1810 , and Favre played a major role in facilitating the transfer , and keeping the Indians informed of the events . Favre was considered the top interpreter in the region by men of prominence , including Governor William C. C. Claiborne of Louisiana who made Favre a justice of the peace , and recommended him for the position of United States agent to the Choctaws . A \" talk \" that Favre gave to the Choctaws on the eve of the War of 1812 was touted by historian Russell Guerin as a masterpiece of diplomacy , and displayed Favre 's deep understanding of the native language and culture . Favre died in 1813 , leaving many minor children and a substantial estate of more than 5000 acres of land and 57 slaves . He had 13 known children with three different women , and leaves numerous descendants . A well-known descendant is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre . Simon Favre 's associations with property owners and prominent officials demonstrate that he was a person of very high social standing . = = Life = = = = = Ancestry = = = Born near Mobile , then a part of French Louisiana , on May 31 , 1760 , Simon Favre was the son of Jean Claude Favre ( 1721 \u2013 1782 ) and Marguerite Wiltz ( 1740 \u2013 1805 ) . His grandfather , Jean Baptiste Favre , came from Royan , France , and by tradition was a cabin boy when Pierre D 'Iberville placed him on shore near Biloxi to make contact with the natives . His father was a government interpreter who was commissioned to explain the terms of the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) to the natives upon the conclusion of the French and Indian War . Favre 's mother was the daughter of a Swiss soldier . = = = Early life = = = Learning from his father , Favre became fluent in the languages of French , English , Spanish , and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw . The lands along the Gulf coast were held by the British for nearly two decades following the 1763 Treaty of Paris , but their ability to maintain control diminished during that time . On September 3 , 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles . Favre 's father had just died the year before this treaty , and Simon Favre followed his father 's career , also inheriting his father 's plantation on the Pearl River , though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother . Favre spent his early adult years among the natives along the Tombigbee River , being initially employed by the French as an interpreter of the Choctaw language , but soon coming into the employ of the British and later the Spanish . Favre also understood the Chickasaw language , but at one point his translation was challenged by James Colbert ( grandfather of Holmes Colbert ) , who had married into the Chickasaw tribe , and was asked by the tribe to replace Favre as interpreter . Favre was said to be a confidante and personal friend of the celebrated Choctaw Indian chief Pushmataha . Genealogist Heitzmann relates that at one point Favre acted as the interpreter between Pushmataha and the military commanders Andrew Jackson and General Thomas Hinds . In 1792 Juan De la Villebeuvre , who worked among the Indians on behalf of the Spanish government , was named a special commissioner to the Choctaws and Chickasaws . Favre 's reputation as a competent and valuable interpreter grew quickly , and in an undated letter to Governor Francisco Carondelet , De la Villebeuvre wrote , \" ... I am going to reside with Favre , who is employed by the king [ of Spain ] and who will serve me as interpreter . He is the best one of the province , with a great influence over the minds of the Indians , and he knows how to lead them firmly whenever necessary . \" Favre built a house for De la Villebeuvre about 12 miles from the village of the Choctaw chief Franchimastabee with whom Favre had become friendly . Favre was present at Fort Nogales , located in Choctaw territory near the mouth of the Yazoo River , when the Treaty of Nogales was signed on October 28 , 1793 . The treaty was between Spain ( and signed by the king ) and the Alibamon , Cherokee , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek and Tallapoosa nations . Representing the Choctaws were chiefs Franchimastabee and Pushmataha , while Favre signed as a witness . In January 1794 Favre wrote a letter to Don Manuel Lanzos , Spanish commander at Natchez , warning of a great rumor among the Choctaws that the Americans were coming to destroy them . The Choctaws were in difficult straits at the time , from both the consumption of alcohol and from a corn crop failure brought on by an earlier drought . They were stealing horses from other tribes as well as from the Europeans , and Favre himself had three horses stolen while staying near the Tombigbee . De la Villebeuvre felt that these actions were being instigated by the Americans , and Favre was sent to the Choctaw villages to assess the feelings of the natives . Following the Treaty of Boukfouka on May 10 , 1793 , the Spaniards built a fort on the location where the French had earlier built Fort Tombecbe , and named it Confederacion in honor of the alliance between the Spanish and Indians . In the late 1700s Favre was living near Fort Confederation , but sometime after 1797 moved to St. Stephens . He moved into a house across the road from Augustin Rochon , his future father-in-law . After spending time there and at various other locations along the Tombigbee , Favre returned to Mobile before 1800 where he occupied a house on Loyal Street . While there , he associated with other interpreters including J. B. Roussere and Simon Andry . Favre also maintained very close ties with New Orleans , and he called himself of that city in the 1800 baptismal record for his son Simon . = = = Pearl River = = = After having seven children with two other women , Favre was legally married in Mobile in 1801 to Celeste Rochon . Sometime between 1804 and 1806 , following the birth of two children in Mobile , he moved with his new family to one of his plantations on the Pearl River , near what became Pearlington , Mississippi . This was shortly following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 , when the Americans were showing a great interest in West Florida , still governed by Spain . Favre then became an important interpreter in the service of the Americans , as well as continuing to work for the Spanish who were eventually compelled to give up control of their Florida lands . While Favre 's importance had initially sprung from his influence with the native tribes , particularly the Choctaws , as the power of these people declined he became much more important as an intermediary during the turbulent times of transition from Spanish to American rule in West Florida . During this period early in the 19th century , the Spanish authorities were losing their hold on West Florida for a variety of reasons . One such reason was piracy , while another was American encroachment following the Louisiana Purchase . Many Americans felt that West Florida should have been included in the purchase . One means used by Spain to attempt to hold on to this region was to commission several important settlers to work for their government . In this regard , Favre was assigned to confirm land deeds that the Spanish were doling out at an accelerated rate , to attempt to stem the tide of American encroachment . Favre also provided intelligence and military maps to the Spanish concerning the activities of not only the Americans , who were applying pressure from outside the jurisdiction , but also rebels along the Pearl River and nearby coast . The rebels , led by Reuben Kemper and his brothers , were causing difficulties from within , and had been attempting to pull West Florida from Spanish control for several years . Under the Spanish , Favre became known as the commander of the District of Bay St. Louis . Many of the land titles that were awarded by Favre were later reviewed by the United States government and appear in the collection of American state papers . With Americans in control of New Orleans , mail from Fort Stoddard , near Mobile , had to pass through Spanish territory to get there . In 1808 the United States Postmaster wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury that Favre , who was still a Spanish subject , served as an agent for the post office , forwarding the mail passing through Spanish lands . Though West Florida was not officially ceded to the United States until 1819 under the provisions of the Adams-Onis Treaty , in November 1810 Spanish governor Folach , demanding secrecy , essentially delivered both East and West Florida to the United States in trust . This was done in hopes that the \" robberies and depredations \" upon the citizens would cease , and under the realization that the transfer was inevitable . Soon thereafter American officials began managing the Florida lands , setting up administrative regions within them , and the western part of West Florida ( the part in present-day Louisiana ) was absorbed into the United States under the proclamation of President James Madison . When Louisiana became a state in 1812 , the remainder of West Florida ( the panhandles of Mississippi and Alabama ) was absorbed by the United States . The western part of this newly annexed Mobile District was organized into Hancock and Harrison Counties ( soon a part of the Mississippi Territory ) , and in 1813 American federal troops were stationed there to formalize the transition . = = = Late career and death = = = Just as his father had made the transition from French to British rule , Favre likewise had little difficulty changing his allegiance from the Spanish to the Americans , and he continued to hold a prominent position in the region . In January 1811 Favre was chosen by the Orleans territorial governor William C. C. Claiborne as a magistrate of the \" Parish of Biloxi \" which was within the territory . When Claiborne became the Louisiana governor following statehood in 1812 , he commissioned Favre as a justice of the peace , and clearly admired him , calling him in a letter an educated and very agreeable man who would make an energetic officer . At the outset of the War of 1812 , the Americans were interested in assessing the alignment of the native tribes in regards to their loyalty to Britain . In August 1812 Claiborne sent Favre to present a talk to the native tribes of West Florida . Favre 's carefully crafted words , presented under Claiborne 's name , provide an example of the diplomatic skill with which Favre was able to address the language and culture of the Muskogean tribes . While the goal of Favre and the governor was to keep the Choctaws and other tribes out of the \" white man 's war \" , ultimately the Creeks aligned themselves with the British , and the Americans requested assistance from the Choctaws . In a letter to Secretary of War John Armstrong , Claiborne recommended that \" Colonel Simon Favre \" become a United States agent for the Choctaws . Favre held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Hancock County militia , and early in the War of 1812 he was able to negotiate with the Choctaws to provide assistance against Britain 's Creek allies . Favre died in the summer of 1813 , and though he was living along the Pearl River , court testimony by Peter Moran in 1845 stated that he died in Mobile , and had not been there long before his death . A letter by Mississippi governor David Holmes , dated August 1 , 1813 , mentions the \" absence of Colonel Favre at Mobile \" and \" his subsequent death \" . Favre 's daughter Mary stated that he died on July 21 , but an obituary that appeared in a New Orleans newspaper on July 20 gives his death date as July 3 . Several years after his death , in 1817 or 1818 , his widow married Isaac Graves , with whom she had one additional child , and they lived in Pearlington , Mississippi . Graves had been the operator of Favre 's schooner , Pearl , and had very little estate , but following his marriage to Favre 's widow , he utilized Favre 's estate as his own , much to the disadvantage of Favre 's heirs . = = Favre 's \" wives \" = = While a young man , conducting his business among the Choctaws , Favre consummated a relationship with a native woman named Pistikiokonay , who may have been a daughter of the Choctaw Chief Pushmataha , since there was a documented relationship between Favre and this chief . Over a period of about 15 years Favre sired at least six chldren with this woman , the first of whom was born in about 1784 . Shortly before 1800 he then had a relationship with a woman whose first name has been given as Rebecca or Rosella , and whose last name has been written as Austin or Ostein , with other spelling variations . In 1800 he had an illegitimate son born of this union , and this son , Simon , Jr . , was later named prominently in his will . In 1801 a number of slave exchanges took place between Favre and Austin , as he prepared to marry another woman . On March 25 , 1801 he was legally married to Celeste Rochon , a daughter of Augustine Rochon and Luisa Fievre of Mobile , with whom he had six more children . = = Land holdings and slaves = = In 1806 Favre began cultivation of land on the Pearl River in what became Hancock County , Mississippi . Favre 's land holdings were extensive , and his will mentions eight different plantations totalling over 5000 acres in area . He also acquired 57 slaves shortly before his death , as they were not mentioned in his will , but later became prominently mentioned during the settlement of his estate . The October 1814 inventory of his personal property includes a list of the 57 slaves , giving the name , age , and value of each . The oldest was 80 and valued at $ 5.00 , while the most valuable was a 30-year-old \" cow hunter \" valued at $ 900 . Collectively , the slaves were valued at just under $ 15,000 . The inventory also mentioned 6200 arpents ( 5247 acres ) of land valued at $ 2410 , a schooner named Pearl , and 450 head of cattle . One of Favre 's properties on the Pearl River was originally settled by his father in 1767 , and was inherited by Favre upon his father 's death in 1782 . This plantation later became known as the town of Napoleon , and Favre kept a store there that later became a part of the community 's church . In 1961 all the residents of the town were moved when the property was declared within the buffer zone of the John C. Stennis Space Center . Another one of his Pearl River properties became the town of Pearlington , Mississippi , where many of his children , including those of his Choctaw mistress , lived . Though Favre lived in Hancock County in West Florida , and died in Mobile , Mississippi Territory , documents concerning his estate were also filed in New Orleans , Louisiana , probably by his Hancock County attorney , Rutillius Pray of Pearlington . By 1826 the estate had been partially settled , and during the October court term Pray submitted a final settlement showing total sales from the estate of just under $ 27,000 ( including nearly $ 22,000 for slaves ) , while total debts amounted to nearly $ 33,000 . However , taking into account unsold assets , the estate appears to have been solvent . = = Family = = Favre 's earliest known children were with his Choctaw mistress named Pistikiokonay . This woman lived in what later became Lauderdale County , Mississippi , though most of her children moved to Hancock County where Favre had two large plantations along the Pearl River . Favre had six known or suspected children with her , the earliest born about 1784 , and the last possibly born about 1805 , though without birth records there is uncertainty among most of the birth years . The oldest child was likely Alexis ( male ) , born about 1784 ( based on a deposition he made in 1844 , calling himself aged 60 ) ; he married a Choctaw named Cuna and had several children . A second child , Katherine , died after 1830 without issue . Louis , possibly the third child , had a wife named \" Milisew \" and four children ; he died between 1830 and 1835 . Charles , born about 1798 ( deposed in 1856 that he was 58 years old ) , married Carmelite LaFontaine , had several children , and died by 1868 . Mary , born about 1800 ( aged 70 in the 1870 census ) , never married , but was highly respected in the family and became the administratrix of her father 's estate . Favre 's youngest child with his Choctaw mistress appears to be Jean Baptiste , usually just called Baptiste , who was born about 1805 ( aged about 40 in 1845 ) , married a woman named Toshowahoke , and had two children . In 1800 Favre had an illegitimate son with Rebecca Austin ( also called Rosella Ostein ) , a native of Tombigbee in the District of Mobile . The child , named Simon , was born February 5 , 1800 . Favre left a bequest to the child in 1812 so that he could \" be taught to read and write and to learn a trade or profession . \" Favre had six children with his legal wife , Celeste Rochon , the oldest of whom was Jean ( John ) , born August 2 , 1802 , died January 7 , 1888 , and married Dianna Edwards . Augustine ( Gus ) was born July 17 , 1804 and had two wives , Eleanor and Mary Jane , whose maiden names are uncertain . The third child of this marriage , Onezan ( Nezan ) , was born December 23 , 1806 , died May 10 , 1875 , and married Mary Moody . Next was Louisa Eucharist , born May 15 , 1809 , who married first James Conerly , and then John L. Armstrong . The fifth child was Marguerite , born January 17 , 1812 , died February 6 , 1908 , and married James Murphy . The last child of this marriage was Carlota , who was confirmed in New Orleans in February 1813 , and thus does not appear in her father 's 1812 will . She is not mentioned as an heir of Simon , so may have died young . Probably the best known of Favre 's descendants is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre , who descends from Simon 's Choctaw mistress , through their son Louis .",

In July 2007 , reports of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) were made public , which alleged that during the 2005 \u2013 06 and 2006 \u2013 07 NBA seasons , referee Tim Donaghy bet on games in which he officiated . On August 15 , 2007 , Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation , and a year later he was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release . As a result , the general reaction by the media was that the NBA 's popularity would be hurt by the news of this scandal . = = Initial reports = = The story first broke when the New York Post reported that the FBI was investigating allegations that an NBA referee had bet on games . The story was soon picked up by other major news agencies , as it was revealed that Donaghy was the referee under investigation . The reports claimed that Donaghy had started betting on games in 2005 , and had connections to organized crime . The day after the initial reports , NBA commissioner David Stern said \" that no amount of effort , time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation , to bring to justice an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust in professional sports , and to take the necessary steps to protect against this ever happening again . \" He then held a press conference on July 24 to address questions about the investigation . Although he called the Donaghy matter \" an isolated case \" , he also said it was \" the most serious situation and worst situation that I have ever experienced \" . On July 27 , U.S. Congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Commerce , Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee , asked to meet with Stern regarding the Donaghy matter . In a letter to Stern , Rush indicated that he might call a hearing \" should the facts warrant public scrutiny . \" He also said that the affair could potentially be \" one of the most damaging scandals in the history of American sports . \" On the same day , it was reported that a high school classmate of Donaghy 's , and the classmate 's boss , had bet on NBA games based on Donaghy 's tips . Donaghy later revealed that he was rewarded $ 2,000 cash for each correct pick based on the tips he would pass along . = = = Surrender = = = After the initial reports , Donaghy stayed at his home , before moving to a secure location to avoid the media scrutiny . He surrendered on August 15 , 2007 , and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy . He told judges that he had used coded language to tip others about players ' physical condition and player \/ referee relations , and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006 \u2013 07 season . In total , he received $ 30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies . Donaghy also admitted that he had a severe gambling addiction , and was on medication to address it . He was released on a $ 250,000 bond . = = Sentencing = = On June 11 , 2008 , Donaghy alleged in a statement through his lawyers that several series in the NBA Playoffs had been improperly refereed according to the NBA 's instructions . He alluded specifically to a playoff game where \" personal fouls [ resulting in obviously injured players ] were ignored even when they occurred in full view of the referees \" because \" it was in the NBA 's interest to add another game to the series . \" The game referred to was widely believed to be Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings , in which the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter . Donaghy also referred to a playoff series where \" Team 3 's Owner alleged that referees were letting a Team 4 player get away with illegal screens . NBA Executive Y told Referee Supervisor Z that the referees for that game were to enforce the screening rules strictly against that Team 4 player . \" The playoff series was believed to be the first-round encounter between the Houston Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks in the 2005 NBA Playoffs . The Rockets led 2 \u2013 0 in the series before losing in 7 games , and then-Rockets head coach Jeff Van Gundy was fined $ 100,000 for stating that a referee was targeting Houston center Yao Ming . On July 29 , 2008 , Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in prison , and three years of supervised release . Although his lawyer asked for a probationary sentence , Donaghy admitted that he had \" brought shame on myself , my family and the profession \" . Donaghy was released from federal prison on November 4 , 2009 . He is under supervised release by a federal parole-type officer . = = Reaction = = Immediately after the reports were released , several writers said that the NBA 's popularity would be hurt by the news . Chris Sheridan of ESPN said that \" the general American public has been turning away since the end of the Bulls ' dynasty , and this fiasco isn 't going to help bring it back \" , and J. A. Adande said that \" the integrity of the games just took a major hit \" . Sports gambling expert R. J. Bell , president of sports betting information site Pregame.com , tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007 . He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA , the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time . In the previous two seasons , this only happened 44 percent of the time . According to Bell , the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000 , and there was \" a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor . \" He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip \u2014 an indication that big money had been wagered on the game . The big money won every time \u2014 another indication that \" something ( was ) going on \" . However , Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn 't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy 's actions during a game ; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on . Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game , despite Stern 's insistence that Donaghy was a \" rogue official \" . According to Lang , an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game . For instance , Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus . When a game is being fixed , Lang said , the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future . Lang also believed a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI . As a result of the betting scandal , Stern revised the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors ' meeting in 2007 . Despite the labor agreement for referees , which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling , it was revealed that about half of the NBA 's officials had made bets in casinos , albeit not with sportsbooks . In addition , almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling . Stern stated that \" [ the ] ban on gambling is absolute , and in my view it is too absolute , too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years \" . The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting \u2014 though not on sports . There were several other referee-related rule changes made : the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game , to reduce the value of the information to gamblers ; referees received more in-season training and counseling on gambling ; more thorough background checks were carried out ; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees ' gambling patterns for those games ; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal .",

In July 2007, reports of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) were made public, which alleged that during the 2005 \u2013 06 and 2006 \u2013 07 NBA seasons, referee Tim Donaghy bet on games in which he officiated. On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation, and a year later he was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release."
