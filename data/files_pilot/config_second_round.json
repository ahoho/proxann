Following the 2010 \u2013 11 Big Ten Conference men 's basketball season , Darius Morris was selected as a third team All-Big Ten selection by both the conference 's coaches and the conference 's media . Morris was also a National Association of Basketball Coaches ( NABC ) Division I District 7 All \u2010 District second team choice . Since the Big Ten Conference is its own district , this is equivalent to being named second team All-Big Ten by the NABC . Following the season , Morris sought the advice of the NBA 's undergraduate advisory committee to determine his draft prospects . On May 4 , Morris announced his final decision not to withdraw his name prior to the May 8 deadline and to enter the June 23 , 2011 NBA Draft . = = Professional career = = = = = 2011 \u2013 12 season = = = ESPN 's Chad Ford described Morris at 6 feet 5 inches ( 1.96 m ) as the biggest true point guard in the draft . Morris was selected by his hometown Los Angeles Lakers in the second round of the 2011 NBA Draft with the 41st overall selection . In the week prior to the beginning of the 2011 \u2013 12 NBA season , Morris appeared along with teammates Derek Fisher , Steve Blake and Matt Barnes on the December 22 season 1 finale of The X Factor during a performance by 50 Cent . On January 11 , he played 13 minutes against Utah in his first game for the Lakers , contributing his first four points , his first two assists and first rebound . The game went to overtime and marked the Lakers ' first road victory of the season in four attempts . Morris began seeing action as Blake endured a costrochaondral fracture of the cartilage that connects the rib to the sternum in subsequent games . Morris stayed in the main rotation for seven games during Blake 's rib injury before returning to a limited role . On March 7 , 2012 , Morris was assigned to the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League . Morris debuted for the Defenders with 21 points on March 10 . He was recalled by the Lakers on March 16 , 2012 .

On December 16 , Morris posted a career-high 15 points against the Philadelphia 76ers . A few nights later , Kobe Bryant praised him for his defensive effort . When Nash returned to the starting lineup on December 22 , Morris started in place of Metta World Peace , who came off the bench . This was part of a common strategy employed by Lakers head coach Mike D 'Antoni to play players out of position . While a starter , Morris ' responsibility was to defend against the opponents ' most dangerous perimeter player . On January 4 , World Peace returned to the starting lineup in Morris ' place . Then in late January , Jodie Meeks replaced Morris in the rotation as Blake also returned to the rotation . On March 7 , 2013 , Morris was reassigned to the Los Angeles D-Fenders . He played for the D-Fenders on March 9 , scoring 21 points and adding 6 rebounds , 2 assists and a steal . He was recalled on March 9 , 2013 .

On November 16 , 2013 he scored a NBA regular season career high 20 points along with 2 assists in a 135 \u2013 98-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans . On November 20 , 2013 , he was waived by the 76ers as part of roster moves that included signing Elliot Williams and Lorenzo Brown and waiving Kwame Brown . In December , he was one of several guards to work out with the Memphis Grizzlies . That month , he was also considered by the Los Angeles Lakers when Kobe Bryant was injured since point guards Blake , Nash and Jordan Farmar were all injured . The Lakers , however , decided to sign Kendall Marshall who was averageing 19.4 points and 9.6 assists in the D-League at the time . On January 6 , 2014 , Morris signed a 10-day contract with the Los Angeles Clippers after Chris Paul suffered a separated shoulder .

Bernie Harris was waived on January 20 , 1975 . Mike Macaluso did not return to play for the Braves and never played in the NBA again . On March 21 , Braves general manager Eddie Donovan announced that he would resign effective April 1 .

Upon the announced resignation , NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy announced that the league would conduct a hearing on the matter . The transition was complicated by Donovan 's 5 % ownership of the Braves .

A 1997 Princeton alumnus , Johnson played for the Tigers from 1993 to 1997 . As a player he was a member of the 1995 \u2013 96 Ivy League champions and undefeated ( in conference ) 1996 \u2013 97 Princeton Tigers . He earned Ivy League Men 's Basketball Player of the Year recognition for the undefeated 1997 team . He continues to hold the Ivy League record for consecutive three point shots made and the league record for most single-game three point shots made without a miss as well as the Princeton Tigers record for career steals . His college career was marked by many memorable overtime performances , game-winning shots and game-clinching free throws . Nonetheless , his greatest recognition came for his defense . During a seven-year professional career , he won three championships in Europe . After being hired in 2007 , he has been the youngest coach in the Ivy League for his entire four-year tenure there . In his fourth season , he coached the 2010 \u2013 11 Princeton Tigers men 's basketball team to a league championship . Previously as an assistant he was part of the 2006 \u2013 07 Big East Conference champions . = = Playing career = = Johnson spent much of his childhood in Baltimore . He played his sophomore and junior season of high school basketball at Moorhead Senior High School in Moorhead , Minnesota . Johnson transferred from Minnesota to Towson Catholic High School prior to his senior season . During the early signing period from November 13 through November 20 , 1991 , Johnson , who was considering several Ivy League schools as well as Northeastern University , verbally committed to Boston University . On December 1 , 1991 , Boston University announced that Johnson signed a letter of intent . During his senior season , Johnson lead Towson to the Baltimore Catholic Basketball League Championship . Following the season , he earned Baltimore Catholic Basketball League All-league first-team recognition . He was also selected to participate in the Rodney Beasley East vs. West All-Star Games , sponsored by the Baltimore Metro Coaches Association . He was also a second team All-metro selection and following his 1992 graduation attended the Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia for a postgraduate year . In April 1993 , after playing a year a Fork Union , Johnson signed a letter of intent with Herb Sendek 's Miami ( OH ) team , but upon being accepted by Princeton University in June of that year , he revoked his letter . Johnson showed strong leadership skills early at Princeton and is the only three-time captain in university history . During his freshman year , he was twice named Ivy League Men 's Basketball Rookie of the Week for the 1993 \u2013 94 team . That season the 11 \u2013 3 Tigers could not match the Penn Quakers who were led by Jerome Allen and Matt Maloney . Johnson provided heroics for the 1994 \u2013 95 Tigers on a couple of occasions . On December 27 , 1994 , he hit what The New York Times described as \" a falling-down 3-point basket with three seconds left in regulation \" . The basket forced overtime . At the end of the third overtime period Johnson converted two foul shots with three seconds left to cement a 71 \u2013 66 victory over Texas A & M. Later that season , he set a career-high with a 25-point performance against Harvard in a double-overtime victory . He recorded seven steals in a game against Brown on February 3 , 1995 , which is one shy of the school record . Again the Tigers could not get past Penn . As a junior , he was named Ivy League Player of the week for the second weekend in February as he led the team on both ends of the court . The following week , he posted 21 points against Yale , which established his season-high . Even after Allen and Maloney graduated , Princeton 's only two losses were to Penn . After Princeton and Penn ended the 1995 \u2013 96 season tied as Ivy League Co-Champions , Johnson made the decisive three point shot with one minute and four seconds remaining in overtime in the one-game playoff , corralled a defensive rebound , added a pair of free throws with 24 seconds left and then made a steal . The win ended an eight-game losing streak to Penn . The win earned the team the conference automatic bid to the 1996 NCAA Tournament and following the game head coach Pete Carril announced his retirement . The thirteen seeded team was matched against the defending national champion UCLA Bruins in its first round pairing . He was the team 's leading scorer with 11 points in the 43 \u2013 41 first round victory over UCLA in the 1996 NCAA Tournament . The team fell behind 41 \u2013 34 with over six minutes remaining . His 3-of-7 three point shooting performance included a shot to bring the team to within 4 . He also made the game-tying layup to knot the score at 41 . He also defended Toby Bailey 's last second shot after Princeton took the lead with 3.9 seconds remaining . During the game , UCLA jumped out to a 7 \u2013 0 lead at the first TV timeout , and Johnson 's leadership held the team together early when UCLA looked strong . As a senior , his new head coach , Bill Carmody described him as a shutdown defender . He was 1997 Ivy League Men 's basketball Player of the Year . Johnson earned the award for his defense and was the first winner with a single-digit scoring average . He scored 15 on February 22 , when Princeton clinched the Ivy League regular season championship by defeating Dartmouth . The following week , he established Ivy League records for most consecutive three-point field goals made , with 11 , and the most single-game three-point field goals made with no misses ( 6 for 6 ) against Columbia Lions men 's basketball on February 28 , 1997 and Cornell Big Red men 's basketball ( first 5 ) on March 1 , 1997 . He had twelve points in the regular season finale during which Princeton tied the school record with its nineteenth consecutive win . In the 1997 NCAA Tournament opening round matchup against the Cal Bears , when a final second pass was intercepted , he attempted to shoulder the blame with the press . He retired as the Princeton University all-time leader in steals . His 169 total steals were fifth in Ivy League history at the end of his career and was eleventh at the end of the 2009-10 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season . He retired second in Princeton history in career three point shots and fourth in career assists . After writing his senior thesis on Kenyan education under British colonial rule and graduating with a bachelor 's degree in history , Johnson declined the postgraduate scholarship that he was awarded and played five years in Italy followed by two in Spain .

In 1999 , he earned another league championship with for Reggio Calabria , and in his final professional season in 2004 he earned a league title with Siena . With Reggio Calabria , he teamed with Brent Scott , Brian Oliver , and Manu Ginobili to win a championship . = = Coaching career = = = = = Georgetown = = = Johnson was then brought on as an assistant to the newly appointed head coach at Georgetown , John Thompson III in 2004 . The team was coming off of a losing record and made it to a 2005 National Invitation Tournament . The team reached the Sweet Sixteen round of the 2006 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . During his tenure at Georgetown , he helped coach the team to an overall 72 \u2013 30 record over 3 seasons and the 2006 \u2013 07 team the 2007 Big East regular season championship , the 2007 Big East Men 's Basketball Tournament championship , and a trip to the Final Four of the 2007 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . = = = Princeton = = = When Scott abandoned his struggling Princeton team to coach at Denver in 2007 , athletic director Gary Walters hired Sydney Johnson to take over the program . Johnson emerged from a field of Princeton offense veterans that included Mike Brennan , Robert Burke , Craig Robinson , Bill Carmody , Armond Hill , Chris Mooney , and Mitch Henderson . Johnson 's demeanor as a coach is said by players to be more benevolent than his predecessor , Joe Scott , who left for the University of Denver after compiling a losing record in three years at Princeton . He was regarded as an inexperienced coach because he only had three years of experience as an assistant coach . He became the youngest coach in the Ivy League . Johnson inherited a team that had gone 2 \u2013 12 in conference the prior season and 38 \u2013 45 overall during the prior three season . Among the lowlights that the team had achieved during the Scott era was a 21-point performance that tied the record for fewest points since the inception of the three point shot and the shot clock . The team had ranked last in the nation in scoring in both 2006 and 2007 . Although race is an issue among collegiate coaching ranks , in Johnson 's first year , he was one of six African-American men 's basketball head coaches in the 8-team Ivy League . Johnson employs the Princeton offense . Former Tiger stars Brian Earl and Scott Greenman were among Johnson 's assistants at Princeton . After a tumultuous first season of rebuilding during which it posted a 3 \u2013 11 record , Princeton began to show great improvement in 2008 \u2013 2009 . Even with only three games left on their schedule and a 7 \u2013 4 conference record , they still controlled their own destiny for a possible postseason bid . They finished 13 \u2013 14 with an 8 \u2013 6 record in the Ivy League , which tied them with Yale for second place . Along the way , the Tigers defeated Fordham , UNC-Greensboro , and Lehigh during their non-conference schedule and also notched wins over Harvard twice . One highlight of the season was an early season victory over eventual Ivy League champs Cornell who had possessed a 19-game Ivy League winning streak . The Ivy League does not name a coach of the year in any sport , but Collegeinsider.com named Johnson Ivy League Coach of the Year . During Johnson 's third season , the 2009 \u2013 10 team rebounded from a 2 \u2013 4 start to win 20 of its final 25 games and earn a berth in the 2010 College Basketball Invitational .

The team won the gold medal , although Parker missed some games , including the semifinal , with an ankle injury . = = Player profile = = Parker was frequently compared to Derrick Rose in high school . According to Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael O 'Brien , as of November 2011 , Rose had a 3 \u2013 0 advantage in defining moments : \" the back-to-back dunks against Washington in the city championship at the United Center , the game-winning shot in overtime to give Simeon the state championship against Peoria Richwoods and the dismantling of Oak Hill , the top-ranked team in the country . \" Rose 's game against the Oak Hill team with Brandon Jennings , Nolan Smith and Alex Legion on ESPN is described as Rose 's national introduction . Although there are comparisons to Rose , his game is most often compared to Grant Hill and Paul Pierce . Dime Magazine describes him as \" Grant Hill with a jump shot \" . Parker claims to model his game after Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony . He hopes to be regarded as the best high school basketball player in the history of the city of Chicago and has stated that \" being compared to Derrick also drives me . I know if I get better than him or break the records he broke I could be one of the best players to come out of Chicago . I look forward to being one of those players . \" Because of the title of the Sports Illustrated story that compared Parker to LeBron James , Mike DeCourcy of Sporting News stated that \" Jabari Parker is , rather , the best [ high school basketball player ] since Greg Oden . \" In addition , Parker was considered to have a much less developed physique than James at the same stage of development . CBS Sports ' Jeff Borzello also contested the proclamation , pointing out that since James 's 2003 class both Dwight Howard ( 2004 ) and Oden ( 2006 ) were consensus top players in their classes and that Parker might not be any better than the most recent consensus , Oden . In addition , CBS noted that Parker \" might not even be the best high school basketball player in the country , given the development of class of 2014 's Andrew Wiggins . \" Chicago Tribune writer Mike Helfgot described the Sports Illustrated comparison as \" incredibly irresponsible journalism \" , noting he had once worked for the Star-Ledger when it described Derrick Caracter as the next James . Following his four consecutive championships with Simeon , Parker ( and Chicago 's Simeon ) were compared to McClain ( and Peoria 's Manual ) . Peoria 's Journal Star emphasized that McClain was 32 \u2013 0 as a starter in IHSA play because in the 1994 \u2013 97 time period the IHSA was only divided into two classes . Thus , Manual had to wade through an 8-round tournament instead of the 7-round modern 4-class format . However , Simeon won 6 of its 7 games in its final championship by more than 10 points , while Manual only won 3 of its 8 by such a margin . In the postgame press conference , Simeon Coach Smith emphasized that his team had to endure the pressure of playing a national schedule that included games against elite teams in distant venues . Note , that with the 4-class system rather than the 2-class system of the past , the 2013 Class 3A IHSA champion was CPL runner-up Morgan Park , who split 2 neutral court 2013 games with Simeon . As noted above , Rose-era Simeon teams only won 2 championships in the 2-class era . Adding Parker 's 55-11 start to a 33 \u2013 1 junior year and a 30 \u2013 3 senior season gives him a 118 \u2013 15 legacy compared to Rose 's 120 \u2013 12 . = = Personal life = = Parker is of Tongan and African American descent . His parents are Folola \" Lola \" Finau-Parker and Sonny Parker . His father , Sonny , a Chicago native , played for the Texas A & M Aggies before becoming a 1976 NBA Draft first round selection ( 17th overall ) by the Golden State Warriors .

His father , Gustavo , was a point guard for a number of professional basketball teams in Argentina . Pepe S\u00e1nchez convinced Fern\u00e1ndez to play basketball at his alma mater , Temple University , and Fern\u00e1ndez joined the Temple Owls team in December 2008 . As a sophomore , he was named Atlantic 10 Tournament Most Valuable Player . After struggling through a prolonged shooting slump as a junior , he hit an off-balance 18-foot shot with .4 seconds to play to defeat Penn State in the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament and was named to the All-Atlantic 10 Third Team . In addition to his college exploits , he led Argentina to a gold medal in the 2008 Under-18 World Championship . = = Early life = = Fern\u00e1ndez was born on July 22 , 1990 in Rio Tercero , Argentina to Gustavo Fern\u00e1ndez and Nancy Fiandrino . His father was a point guard for a number of professional basketball teams in Argentina . He earned the nickname \" Lobito \" ( Spanish for \" little wolf \" ) after starring on a basketball team with a wolf mascot . Juan Fern\u00e1ndez 's little brother , also named Gustavo , fell out of a chair when he was a toddler and used a wheelchair for life . He is one of the top wheelchair tennis players in the world under the age of 18 . The family operates the Pinot Grigio restaurant in R\u00edo Tercero . At the urging of his father , Juan Fern\u00e1ndez began playing basketball when he was six years old . He described himself as a \" fat little kid \" who was more interested in being a soccer goalie at first . When Fern\u00e1ndez showed star potential on junior club teams , he was given the \" Lobito \" nickname , while his father became known as \" Lobo \" . As a teenager , Fern\u00e1ndez was offered deals to play in the Spanish B and C league when he graduated from Dr. Alexis Carrel High School . At the same time , he was considering playing college basketball in the United States . His mother went to Connecticut for six months to learn English , and she persuaded him that it would be a good place to be a student-athlete . Pepe S\u00e1nchez , an Argentine basketball player who played college basketball at Temple University , offered some advice in an e-mail : \" I 'm not the kind of guy who preaches about what people should do . But when kids like Juan ask me , I tell them my two greatest experiences in basketball was playing for my college team and my national team \u2013 the two times that money wasn 't involved . It was about the chance to represent your school and your country . More than that , it just opened my mind to so much . \" When I spoke with Juan , it just struck me he was the same and that college was the right situation to him . I told him regardless of what happens in basketball \u2013 whether he plays in the NBA , in Europe , whatever \u2013 going to college would make the biggest difference in his life . \" S\u00e1nchez had recommended Fern\u00e1ndez to the coach of his alma mater , Fran Dunphy . Dunphy dispatched assistant Matt Langel to recruit Fern\u00e1ndez to Temple . On one recruiting trip , Langel drove for 10 hours on the backroads of Argentina searching for Fern\u00e1ndez , who was practicing with the national team instead of home in Rio Tercero as Langel had thought . After his official visit to the Philadelphia campus in September 2008 , Fern\u00e1ndez signed his letter of intent . He graduated high school in December , and enrolled at Temple . = = College career = = = = = Freshman = = = Fern\u00e1ndez played college basketball with the Temple Owls men 's basketball team . At Temple , Fern\u00e1ndez drew immediate comparisons to S\u00e1nchez ; he was dubbed \" Pepe S\u00e1nchez with a jump shot . \" He chose S\u00e1nchez 's jersey , number 4 , but Fern\u00e1ndez said this was to honor his father . Unfamiliar with the practice of lifting weights , Fern\u00e1ndez wore gloves to his first session , drawing the laughs of his teammates . Against Kent State , Fern\u00e1ndez contributed eight points and four assists in his Temple debut , three days after arriving in the United States . He scored a season-high 19 points on February 15 , 2009 , to power Temple past Duquesne 78 \u2013 73 . The Owls reached the 2009 NCAA Tournament after winning the Atlantic 10 tournament title . In 23 games , he averaged 5.5 points and 2.7 assists per game on the basketball court , and earned a 3.0 grade point average in the classroom . = = = Sophomore = = = In his sophomore year , Fern\u00e1ndez was moved to shooting guard in the Temple starting lineup , a change that felt strange for him as he was used to playing point guard . He was still in frequent playmaking positions , and led the team in assists with 3.6 per game . He increased his scoring average to 12.6 points per game , second on the team , and led the Atlantic 10 in three-point percentage ( 45.3 % ) . Fern\u00e1ndez scored in double figures in 23 games . On December 13 , he netted a career best 33 points to upset local rival and third-ranked Villanova 75 \u2013 65 ; he shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc . This earned him Philadelphia Big Five Player of the Week honors for the week of December 7 \u2013 14 . As a result of his performance against Villanova and his 21 points versus Seton Hall , Fern\u00e1ndez was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week on December 20 . In the Fordham game on January 23 , 2010 , he took a blow to the head and was forced to leave in the second half . He missed the February 2 game against Richmond with post-concussive symptoms . Fern\u00e1ndez became a fan favorite at Temple . Every time he made a three-pointer against Bowling Green , the Temple student section chanted \" Ole , ole , ole ! \" Seton Hall fans were not so kind , mocking him with \" Messi , Messi . \" Little did they realize that Lionel Messi was one of his favorite soccer players , and their comments only served as inspiration . On his return flights to Argentina , strangers frequently went up to Fern\u00e1ndez to congratulate him on his recent performances . Fern\u00e1ndez helped Temple to a 29 \u2013 5 season , capture a share of the Atlantic 10 conference regular season championship with a 14 \u2013 2 record , and earn a third consecutive Atlantic 10 conference tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament . He was named Atlantic 10 Tournament Most Valuable Player after scoring 18 points in the final versus Richmond . In the NCAA Tournament , Temple was seeded fifth and matched up with 12 seed Cornell in the first round . Fern\u00e1ndez had 14 points , but his Owls were upset by the Big Red 78 \u2013 65 . Following the season , Fernandez was an All-Atlantic 10 Honorable Mention selection . = = = Junior = = = With the graduation of Luis Guzm\u00e1n , Fern\u00e1ndez switched back to his natural position at point guard in his junior campaign . Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection . He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard in college basketball . A shooting slump that lasted the majority of the season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5 % , his three point percentage drop to 33.3 % , and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game . He still led the team in assists , with 3.9 per game . Fern\u00e1ndez did miss four games in the middle of the season due to a bone bruise in his knee , but the shooting slump was more devastating and caused him to consult a sports psychologist . One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond , in which he went 3-for-17 from the field and committed three turnovers . After the game Fran Dunphy convinced Fern\u00e1ndez that he had to take less shots and get his teammates involved . Fern\u00e1ndez led Temple to a 26 \u2013 8 record and a seven seed in the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . In the Round of 64 , he hit an off-balance 18-foot shot with .4 seconds to play to defeat Penn State , 66 \u2013 64 , and finished with a season-high 23 points . In the timeout that preceded the shot , teammate Khalif Wyatt convinced coach Dunphy to draw up a play for Fern\u00e1ndez , despite his struggles during the season . Fern\u00e1ndez finished with 14 points against San Diego State , but the Owls fell in double overtime .

The daughter of two national basketball team players , Jackson was awarded a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport ( AIS ) in 1997 , when she was 16 . In 1998 , she led the AIS side that won the Women 's National Basketball League ( WNBL ) championship . Jackson joined the Canberra Capitals for the 1999 season when she turned 18 , and played with the team off and on until 2006 , winning four more WNBL championships . From 2010 to 2016 , Jackson played with the Canberra Capitals , which she did during the Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) offseason during the time she continued WNBA play . Jackson made the Australian under-20 team when she was only 14 years old , and was first called up to the Australian Women 's National Basketball Team ( nicknamed The Opals ) when she was 16 years old . She was a member the 2000 Summer Olympics , and 2004 Summer Olympics teams , captain of the 2008 Summer Olympics team , winning three silver medals . She was also part of the Australian team that won the bronze at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Jackson was a member of the Australian Senior Women 's Team that won a silver medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship for Women in China , co-captain of the team that won a gold medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne , and captain of the team that won a gold medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship for Women in Brazil . In 2001 , Jackson entered the Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) draft and was selected by the Seattle Storm , which viewed Jackson as a franchise player . She has won two WNBA titles with the Storm , in 2004 and 2011 , the latter also earning Jackson the WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award . Jackson ranks among the top WNBA players in played games and minutes , field goals and three point shoots , and turnover percentage . Jackson has played club basketball in Europe with WBC Spartak Moscow in Russia and Ros Casares Valencia in Spain . She has also played with the Women 's Korean Basketball League , where she was named the league 's Most Valuable Player and set a league record scoring 56 points , and the Women 's Chinese Basketball Association . Jackson announced her retirement from basketball on 31 March 2016 , citing a persistent knee injury as the reason for her decision . Besides her basketball career Jackson is in the process of attaining her university degree at the Macquarie University , majoring in gender studies . = = Personal = = Lauren Elizabeth Jackson , whose nicknames include \" Loz \" , \" Jacko \" and \" LJ \" , was born in Albury , New South Wales , on 11 May 1981 , the oldest of two children of Gary Jackson and his wife Maree Bennie . Both her parents played for Australia 's national basketball teams . Jackson inherited her height from her father , Gary , who played for the Boomers in 1975 , while her mother , Maree , played for the Opals from 1974 to 1982 . She played in two World Championships , and for the women 's basketball team at Louisiana State in the late 1980s , wearing the number 15 , the number Jackson wears in her mother 's honour . She was one of the first Australians to play in the American collegiate system , where she was known for her aggressive style of play and was nicknamed \" the assassin \" . Her parents continued to play basketball locally on the social level when Lauren and her brother were young , and her family had a basketball court in their backyard when Jackson was growing up . Her grandfather played for the Western Suburbs Magpies . Jackson grew up in Albury , where she attended Murray High School . She earned her Higher School Certificate in Canberra while she was training with the Australian Institute of Sport . Jackson studied for a psychology degree at Lomonosov Moscow State University and continued via correspondence from America . In 2007 she was working on a university course in business management . When she finishes her playing career , Jackson wants to become a basketball administrator . She said \" Where I put my time and energy is now crucial . I want to get involved in the political side of sport rather than the media and I need to learn from the people who have been there before . \" In 2010 , she was taking classes at Macquarie University in Sydney . Her course work was centred in cultural studies and included topics like women 's rights and racism . Injuries have prevented her from studying around 2010 , but in 2012 , she was back working on her degree , and her aspirations have included becoming a United Nations diplomat . She has also considered becoming an advocate for women . Her interests regarding gender studies were inspired by a book regarding the rape during the Rwandan Genocide , and Jackson is even an embassador of a foundation that seeks to empower the abused women of that war . As a youngster , Jackson was active in other sports . She was involved in athletics at school and played tennis , which she gave up because competitions conflicted with her ability to play basketball . Similarly , she played on her school netball team , until the age of 14 , giving it up because of basketball commitments . In the off season , Jackson trains by pumping weights . Jackson is 195 centimetres ( 77 in ) tall . She was this tall by the time she turned 16 , after she gained 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) in height when she was 15 years old . = = Celebrity = = By 2003 , she was being recognised around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan . She said of her private life : \" I don 't really have a private life . I 've found it difficult as an athlete , to maintain a relationship . It 's not one of my best points but I 've got family and friends who compensate for that . When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun , and there were moments when people criticised me for that , and you know what , I 'm young , I 'm going to do that , and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn 't care . \" She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons : First , she gets recognised by too many people . Second , everyone wants to comment on her height . In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies , internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved . These rumours were incorrect . Jackson said of them : \" When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like , ' Oh ... My ... God ! When I tell you we were in hysterics ... because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind . A 7 foot 8 Chinese man ? That 's just not my thing . I really respect him as a player . And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top . I 'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person . I guess the Chinese people don 't do that stuff very often , so the cultural [ differences ] was a big thing . But I don 't care . You have to laugh about things or you 'll be crying , which I would probably have been doing anyway [ because of the loss and surgery ] . I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time . \" She partied a fair amount in her early 20s . By 2010 , she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5 : 30 am any more because she lacked the stamina . When people google Jackson , some of the first search results feature her in the nude .

In the 2002 / 2003 season , she was one of only three players who were taller than 190 centimetres ( 75 in ) . She played with the Capitals in the Women 's World Cup 2003 where she averaged 30.6 points per game and 11.4 rebounds . She also won the WNBL Grand Final as a member of the Capitals , and was named the Most Valuable Player in the Grand Finals match . During the 2003 / 2004 season , she scored 48 points in a single October 2003 game . This was her highest individual game point total at the time and is her single highest WNBL point scoring game . Jackson returned to the Capitals for the last half of the 2009 / 2010 season . The Capitals started an effort to re-sign Jackson , and in March 2011 , she signed a contract for a million dollars to play in the WNBL . This was the most an Australian woman had ever been offered to play for a domestic side in the country , with most of the top women earning only $ 50,000 a year . Despite returning to Australia and being present at every Capitals game , injuries prevented Jackson from playing in the 2012 \u2013 13 NBDL season . For the 2013 \u2013 14 season , the Capitals missed the deadline date to sign Jackson and led her to play in China instead . Jackson was signed for the Capitals ' next two seasons , and expected to join the team in November 2014 , after recovering from a hip surgery she went through in September . Jackson 's return happened in December 19 against the Adelaide Lightning . Jackson managed to play five more games in the 2014 \u2013 15 WNBL season , losing only one as she averaged 13 points and seven rebounds . Still her physical ailments prevented Jackson from training with her teammates , and requiring weekly drainings of synovial fluid out of her knee . During a double-header road trip in Victoria , Jackson 's knee gave in . A subsequent MRI scan showed further damage to her knee that required new surgeries , forcing Jackson to sit out the rest of the season . The Capitals released Jackson from her contract in January 2016 . = = = China 2013 = = = After missing the 2013 WNBA season and with a deal with Canberra Capitals falling through , in September 2013 Jackson signed with the Heilongjiang Shenda of the Women 's Chinese Basketball Association . She helped Heilongjiang qualify to the playoffs with an average of 22 points , 9.5 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game , but a heel injury made Jackson lose the post-season . Another injury during the season , where Jackson \" pulled my meniscus out of the root of my bone \" was not deemed too grave at the time , but the knee problems would escalate during the following years . = = = National team = = = Jackson made the Australian under-20 team when she was only 14 years old . She was first called up to the senior national team when she was 16 years old . Her national team coaches Tom Maher and Carrie Graf say positive things about Jackson to the press and others but they rarely have said those things to Jackson . This is a strategy designed to help motivate Jackson to play better . Tom Maher who was the coach her called her up said \" She 's so good she could be the greatest sportswoman in the world . She 's that extraordinary . \" Graf has described Jackson as one of the superstars of the game . Jackson was a member of the 1997 Australian Junior Women 's Team that won a silver medal at the World Championships in Brazil . At the time , she was 16 years old . She averaged 14.3 points per game and 9.9 rebounds per game . She was also a member of the 1998 Australian Senior Women 's Team that won a bronze medal at the World Championships in Germany . At the time , she was 16 years old and the youngest Australian woman ever to be named to the team . In the tournament , she averaged 10.9 points per game and 3.9 rebounds per game . She was a key part of the team 's success . She was coached in the tournament by Tom Maher . She came off the bench to play . In the Olympic test tournament in the lead up to the 2000 Summer Olympics , Jackson scored 18 points and 10.7 rebounds per game . She was a member of the 2000 Summer Olympics team that won a silver medal . At the 2000 Games , she scored 127 total points , had 23 total blocked shots , 12 steals and 67 rebounds . She averaged 15.9 points and 8.4 rebounds per game . In the 76 \u2013 54 loss in the gold medal game , she scored 24 points and had 13 rebounds . She led the team in points scored and total rebounds . Going into the Olympics , her team was ranked third in the world . At the Sydney Games , she was coached by Tom Maher . The gold medal final was against the United States . Jackson was a member of the Australian Senior Women 's Team that won a silver medal in the World Championships in China in 2002 . She averaged 23.1 points a game in the competition and was named to the All-Star team for the tournament . She averaged 5.4 rebounds per game . In a semi-final match against the United States , Jackson fouled Lisa Leslie three times in the first six minutes of the game . The team lost while Jackson spent most of the time on the bench . By January 2003 , Jackson had played over 100 games with Australia 's senior side . She competed in the 2003 World Championships and was named the International Basketball Federation 's Most Valuable Player . At the FIBA Diamond Ball Tournament for Women 2004 , she averaged 22.7 points and 14.0 rebounds per game . Jackson was a member of the Australian senior team that won a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics , where she averaged 22.9 points and 10.0 rebounds per game . The gold medal final was against the United States . In 2006 , she was a co-captain with Jenny Whittle of the Australian women 's senior team that won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games . She played in the preliminary final against the Mozambique women 's national basketball team , and the gold deal match against New Zealand . Jackson was the captain of the Australian women 's senior team that won a gold medal at the World Championships in Brazil in 2006 that beat Russia in the Gold Medal match . This was the first time Australia had ever earned gold in the event . Jackson averaged 21.3 points and 8.9 rebounds per game . While the national team is called The Opals , Jackson asked Basketball Australia if they were to make rings for team members in honour of their win , if they would use diamonds instead of opals . As captain of the 2008 Summer Olympics Australian women 's team that won a silver medal at the Olympics , Jackson averaged 17.3 points and 8.6 rebounds per game . In the FIBA Diamond Ball Tournament for Women 2008 , Jackson averaged 20.3 points per game and 5.0 rebounds per game . In 2010 , she was a member of the senior women 's national team that competed at the World Championships in the Czech Republic . She averaged 13.4 points per game and 7.9 rebounds per game . Jackson missed the first training camp for the 2012 Summer Olympics squad in March , but was back by April to train with the team . In June , Jackson tore her adductor magnus muscle during the Australian training camp in the Czech Republic . She was one of the models for the 2012 Australian Olympic team uniforms , and chosen to carry the Australian Flag during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Olympic Games . The hamstring injury prevented Jackson from getting much play during the Olympic tournament , having only had significant court time in the matches against USA and the bronze medal play-off with Russia . After flying to Australia in February 2014 to operate on her heel and knee , Jackson committed to return to the Opals in time for the 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women . However , the delayed recovery of Jackson 's knee led her to give up on the tournament to have her right hip operated on to fix a torn labrum in September 2014 . She had gotten the tear while playing for Ros Casares Valencia in 2012 but went without surgery to not miss the then-upcoming Olympics . Jackson would later express interest in attending her fifth Olympic tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics as a way to close her career , while also pursuing her long-standing dream of a gold medal . However , while attending the Opals training camp in Canberra , she announced her retirement saying her conditions were not improved enough and she needed an \" absolute miracle \" to get into shape . = = Honours = = Jackson was named the Australian International Player of the year in 1999 , 2000 and 2002 . In 2005 , she was inducted into the Australian Institute of Sport ' Best of the Best ' . In late 2011 , the Albury Sports Stadium was renamed the Lauren Jackson Sports Centre . A thousand people showed up at the renaming ceremony , at which Jackson was the guest of honour . She was the flag bearer for Australia at the Summer 2012 London Olympic Games . On 8 June 2015 , she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Queen 's Birthday Honours .",

                    "text": "2007 NBA betting scandal = The 2007 NBA betting scandal was a scandal involving the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) and accusations that an NBA referee used his knowledge of relationships between referees , coaches , players and owners to bet on professional basketball games . In July 2007 , reports of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) were made public , which alleged that during the 2005 \u2013 06 and 2006 \u2013 07 NBA seasons , referee Tim Donaghy bet on games in which he officiated . On August 15 , 2007 , Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation , and a year later he was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release . As a result , the general reaction by the media was that the NBA 's popularity would be hurt by the news of this scandal . = = Initial reports = = The story first broke when the New York Post reported that the FBI was investigating allegations that an NBA referee had bet on games . The story was soon picked up by other major news agencies , as it was revealed that Donaghy was the referee under investigation . The reports claimed that Donaghy had started betting on games in 2005 , and had connections to organized crime . The day after the initial reports , NBA commissioner David Stern said \" that no amount of effort , time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation , to bring to justice an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust in professional sports , and to take the necessary steps to protect against this ever happening again . \" He then held a press conference on July 24 to address questions about the investigation . Although he called the Donaghy matter \" an isolated case \" , he also said it was \" the most serious situation and worst situation that I have ever experienced \" . On July 27 , U.S. Congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Commerce , Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee , asked to meet with Stern regarding the Donaghy matter . In a letter to Stern , Rush indicated that he might call a hearing \" should the facts warrant public scrutiny . \" He also said that the affair could potentially be \" one of the most damaging scandals in the history of American sports . \" On the same day , it was reported that a high school classmate of Donaghy 's , and the classmate 's boss , had bet on NBA games based on Donaghy 's tips . Donaghy later revealed that he was rewarded $ 2,000 cash for each correct pick based on the tips he would pass along . = = = Surrender = = = After the initial reports , Donaghy stayed at his home , before moving to a secure location to avoid the media scrutiny . He surrendered on August 15 , 2007 , and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy . He told judges that he had used coded language to tip others about players ' physical condition and player / referee relations , and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006 \u2013 07 season . In total , he received $ 30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies . Donaghy also admitted that he had a severe gambling addiction , and was on medication to address it . He was released on a $ 250,000 bond . = = Sentencing = = On June 11 , 2008 , Donaghy alleged in a statement through his lawyers that several series in the NBA Playoffs had been improperly refereed according to the NBA 's instructions . He alluded specifically to a playoff game where \" personal fouls [ resulting in obviously injured players ] were ignored even when they occurred in full view of the referees \" because \" it was in the NBA 's interest to add another game to the series . \" The game referred to was widely believed to be Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings , in which the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter . Donaghy also referred to a playoff series where \" Team 3 's Owner alleged that referees were letting a Team 4 player get away with illegal screens . NBA Executive Y told Referee Supervisor Z that the referees for that game were to enforce the screening rules strictly against that Team 4 player . \" The playoff series was believed to be the first-round encounter between the Houston Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks in the 2005 NBA Playoffs . The Rockets led 2 \u2013 0 in the series before losing in 7 games , and then-Rockets head coach Jeff Van Gundy was fined $ 100,000 for stating that a referee was targeting Houston center Yao Ming . On July 29 , 2008 , Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in prison , and three years of supervised release . Although his lawyer asked for a probationary sentence , Donaghy admitted that he had \" brought shame on myself , my family and the profession \" . Donaghy was released from federal prison on November 4 , 2009 . He is under supervised release by a federal parole-type officer . = = Reaction = = Immediately after the reports were released , several writers said that the NBA 's popularity would be hurt by the news . Chris Sheridan of ESPN said that \" the general American public has been turning away since the end of the Bulls ' dynasty , and this fiasco isn 't going to help bring it back \" , and J. A. Adande said that \" the integrity of the games just took a major hit \" . Sports gambling expert R. J. Bell , president of sports betting information site Pregame.com , tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007 . He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA , the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time . In the previous two seasons , this only happened 44 percent of the time . According to Bell , the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000 , and there was \" a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor . \" He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip \u2014 an indication that big money had been wagered on the game . The big money won every time \u2014 another indication that \" something ( was ) going on \" . However , Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn 't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy 's actions during a game ; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on . Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game , despite Stern 's insistence that Donaghy was a \" rogue official \" . According to Lang , an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game . For instance , Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus . When a game is being fixed , Lang said , the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future . Lang also believed a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI . As a result of the betting scandal , Stern revised the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors ' meeting in 2007 . Despite the labor agreement for referees , which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling , it was revealed that about half of the NBA 's officials had made bets in casinos , albeit not with sportsbooks . In addition , almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling . Stern stated that \" [ the ] ban on gambling is absolute , and in my view it is too absolute , too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years \" . The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting \u2014 though not on sports . There were several other referee-related rule changes made : the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game , to reduce the value of the information to gamblers ; referees received more in-season training and counseling on gambling ; more thorough background checks were carried out ; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees ' gambling patterns for those games ; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal .",

Selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the June 2000 Draft , he had brief professional experiences in the Pirates , Montreal Expos , and Texas Rangers minor league systems before debuting with the Rangers in August 2004 . Young 's professional baseball career took off in the 2006 season , when he was the major league leader in opponent batting average , hits per nine innings and road earned run average ( ERA ) and was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for June . Additionally , he extended his streak of consecutive undefeated games started as a visiting pitcher to 24 , and secured the only Padres win in the team 's 3 \u2013 1 series loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Division Series . In 2007 , he defended his opponent batting average and hits per nine innings titles , but instead of winning the road ERA title he won the home ERA title . He is 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) , which makes him , along with former pitchers Eric Hillman , Randy Johnson , Andrew Brackman and Andrew Sisco , the second tallest player in baseball history , next to relief pitcher Jon Rauch ( who is 6 feet 11 inches ( 2.11 m ) and Young 's teammate on the 2012 New York Mets ) . He was elected to the 2007 MLB All-Star Game as a first-time All-Star via the All-Star Final Vote . = = High school = = Young attended Highland Park High School , where he played basketball and baseball . He lettered three times in basketball , in a career in which he scored over 1,000 points , and accumulated 500 rebounds and 200 blocks . He was a two-year letterman in baseball , compiling a 14 \u2013 3 record with 180 strikeouts . In basketball he averaged 16 points , 12 rebounds , and 3 blocked shots a game , and in baseball he had an 8 \u2013 3 record with a 1.70 ERA and 95 strikeouts in 80 innings pitched . As a sophomore in the fall of 1995 , he was moved up to the varsity basketball team from the junior varsity due to injuries . As a junior , his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him . He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final . As a junior in baseball , Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997 . However , he missed a large part of the season after getting off to a 6 \u2013 0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot . Nonetheless , he was already considered a top professional prospect , and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team . By the summer of 1997 , he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series , and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series . By January of Young 's senior season , he had led his basketball team to a district-leading 23 \u2013 1 ( 4 \u2013 0 in district ) record and first place in both the The Dallas Morning News ' Class 4A area poll and the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches ' state poll . Young developed a reputation as a finesse post player , and that season he led his team to the UIL State Tournament championship game . Highland Park lost to Houston 's Waltrip High School and Young was credited with a tournament-high 18 rebounds by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram , although The Dallas Morning News only credited him with 17 points and 14 rebounds . Young finished his senior season as a Texas Association of Basketball Coaches ' first-team All-State selection and the District 9-4A Most Valuable Player . He was later chosen to play in the mid-summer Texas High School Coaches Association 's Southwestern All-Star basketball game at the Hofheinz Pavilion . Young announced he planned to attend Princeton in May 1998 . He chose Princeton over Boston College , University of Oklahoma , University of Pennsylvania , University of Texas , Vanderbilt University , and Yale University . Young 's decision was based on Princeton 's rising national profile in basketball and the opportunity to work with baseball coach Scott Bradley , who had played catcher for the Seattle Mariners while 6 \u2013 10 pitcher Randy Johnson was with the team . On May 9 , 1998 , Young was involved in a combined no-hitter when he pitched into the fifth inning against Mois\u00e9s E. Molina High School and was relieved by Mike Matthews . Highland Park won this game , which was the clinching Region II best-of-3 bi-district series game , by the 10-run rule . Young displayed home run power as a senior , and in some games , he played designated hitter . Later that month , Young pitched another no-hitter in another 10-run rule victory , this time against Carthage High School . Young was the starting pitcher at UFCU Disch-Falk Field during the Texas state 4A championship game victory against Calallen High School , and he clinched the game with a successful pickoff move . He was selected to the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association 1998 All-State baseball team as well as The Texas Sports Writers Association third-team Class 4A all-state baseball . = = College career = = In his freshman season at Princeton University , Young was the first male athlete to be named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in two sports \u2014 basketball and baseball \u2014 and was a unanimous selection for both awards .

His athletic career was not entirely on hold as an upperclassman , and he was able to get some low minor league experience before completing his degree at Princeton in politics in June 2002 and becoming a full-time professional athlete . He played in the class A minor leagues after his junior year . Young then completed his senior thesis , entitled \" The Impact of Jackie Robinson and the Integration of Baseball on Racial Stereotypes in America : A Quantitative Content Analysis of Stories about Race in the New York Times \" while commuting on minor league buses as a player for the Hickory Crawdads .

He was signed to a deal on September 6 . After a few years of minor league service , he was traded to the Montreal Expos ' organization . The Expos traded him to the Texas Rangers , for whom he eventually made his major league debut . After less than two seasons with the Rangers , he was traded to the San Diego Padres . = = = Minor leagues = = = In 2001 , Young went 5 \u2013 3 with a 4.12 ERA in 12 starts for the Hickory Crawdads in the Class-A South Atlantic League , including two complete games .

He posted a 5 \u2013 2 record with a 1.62 ERA , and held opposing batters to a .150 batting average in eight starts . His season was highlighted by an eight-inning , one-hit , no-walk , eight-strikeout performance against the Fort Myers Miracle on May 11 . This capped a 3 \u2013 0 , 0.47 ERA start to the season . In June 2003 , Young was promoted to the Harrisburg Senators of the Double-A Eastern League . He went 4 \u2013 4 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 starts .

He posted four quality starts , and in his fifth start he only allowed two runs . The club was 4 \u2013 1 in his PCL starts . The only loss was due to a blown save with a 4 \u2013 2 ninth-inning lead on August 7 against the Tacoma Rainiers in a game in which Young allowed no earned runs . He was named Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Week for August 16 to 22 after his last start on August 18 against the Memphis Redbirds . Young took a no-hitter into the sixth inning of his second Triple-A start on August 2 against the Sacramento River Cats . = = = Texas Rangers = = = = = = = 2004 = = = = Young debuted with the Rangers on August 24 , 2004 against the Minnesota Twins .

Young exited the game trailing 3 \u2013 0 , but was rescued by a comeback walk-off 5 \u2013 4 win . This debut made Young the first Princeton baseball player to start a major league game at any position since Dave Sisler ( son of Hall of Famer George Sisler and brother of Dick Sisler ) gave up six earned runs in just over four innings on August 27 , 1961 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers . The game also marked the first appearance in a major league game by a Princeton baseball player since Bob Tufts played his final game for the Kansas City Royals on May 6 , 1983 . Other Princeton baseball players who have recorded either 50 innings pitched or 130 at bats ( the requirements to qualify for Rookie of the Year ) in the major leagues are Moe Berg , Homer Hillebrand , King Lear , Dutch Meier , Dutch Sterrett , and Bobby Vaughn . Young has been joined in the major leagues by Princetonian Ross Ohlendorf who debuted for the New York Yankees on September 11 , 2007 . Another Princetonian , Tim Lahey , was on the Philadelphia Phillies roster from the team 's Opening Day on March 31 , 2008 until April 5 , 2008 without making an appearance . The debut , which occurred in a home game at Ameriquest Field in Arlington , served as a homecoming for Young who grew up in nearby Dallas , Texas and went to Highland Park High School . With his debut , Young became the second-tallest player in Major League Baseball , only an inch shorter than the 6-foot-11-inch ( 2.11 m ) Jon Rauch . Three other current and previous pitchers \u2014 Randy Johnson , Andrew Sisco and Eric Hillman \u2014 are also 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) . He became the tallest pitcher in Rangers history , surpassing the 6-foot-8-inch ( 2.03 m ) right-handed pitcher Mike Smithson . After becoming part of the starting rotation , he made seven starts and compiled a 3 \u2013 2 record with a 4.71 ERA . Young signed a three-year contract through 2007 on November 19 . Young 's first major league decision came during his second start in an August 29 loss to the Baltimore Orioles . His first win came in his third start on September 4 against the Boston Red Sox . His fifth start was a six-inning performance in a 1 \u2013 0 win against the Anaheim Angels on September 19 . This was the first Ranger 1 \u2013 0 victory since August 25 , 2000 against the Toronto Blue Jays , a stretch of 669 games . The club went 5 \u2013 2 during his starts in his brief 2004 stint with the club . = = = = 2005 = = = = Young was one of three rookies on the Opening Day roster . He made 31 starts in 2005 with the Rangers , compiling a 12 \u2013 7 record with a 4.26 ERA . His twelve victories tied Kevin Brown 's record for most wins by a Rangers rookie . His season started slowly , with seven earned runs allowed in 7 \u2153 innings pitched ( 8.59 ERA ) over his first two starts . However , over the course of 11 starts from April 17 \u2013 June 13 , he lowered his ERA to a season-low 2.78 by going 6 \u2013 2 , 2.18 in 70 \u2153 innings pitched over that stretch . This included the month of May when he went 3 \u2013 0 in five starts with a 1.42 ERA that was third-best among all qualifying major leaguers for the month . This included his season-high 13 \u2154 scoreless innings recorded from May 3 \u2013 9 . He had subsequent hot and cold streaks , with a record of 2 \u2013 4 and a 9.07 ERA in nine starts from June 20 \u2013 August 2 , followed by a 2.53 ERA over his final nine starts . He closed out the season by winning his final four decisions , which was a personal best . May 9 was one of two times Young came within an inning of a shutout by pitching eight scoreless innings ; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians was the other . Young recorded a personal-best eight strikeouts in a seven-inning no-decision on June 2 at Detroit . The closest Young came to a no-hitter was 5 \u2154 innings of hitless pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning . Over the course of the season , Young was the beneficiary of the second-highest run support in the majors , trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox . However , he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts . After a 2005 season when he went 5 \u2013 0 with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 7 \u2013 7 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games at night , he had a career 8 \u2013 1 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games and 7 \u2013 8 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night . In his rookie season , Young ranked in the top five among qualifying major league rookies in several statistical categories : strikeouts ( second , 137 ) , wins ( tied for third , 12 ) , ERA ( fourth , 4.26 ) , starts ( fifth , 31 ) and innings pitched ( fifth , 164 \u2154 ) . He also tied Rangers rookie club records : wins ( 12 , Edwin Correa in 1986 and Kevin Brown in 1989 ) and pre All-Star break wins ( 8 , Jeff Zimmerman in 1999 and Jos\u00e9 Guzm\u00e1n in 1986 ) . Young ranked fifth among all American League pitchers with 7.5 strikeouts per 9 innings . Despite this success , however , he was a key part of an offseason trade that also sent Terrmel Sledge and Adrian Gonzalez to the San Diego Padres for starting pitcher Adam Eaton , middle reliever Akinori Otsuka and minor-league catcher Billy Killian . = = = San Diego Padres = = = = = = = 2006 = = = = 2006 marked Young 's breakout season . His ERA continued its downward trend , falling to 3.46 over 31 starts , good enough for sixth best in the National League , and he recorded a career-high 169 strikeouts . He finished with an 11 \u2013 5 record , led all major league pitchers with a 2.41 road ERA , allowed a league-leading 6.72 hits per 9 innings pitched , and a .206 opponent batting average . During 2006 he led the majors in stolen bases allowed , with 41 . During the season , Young won a National League Pitcher of the Month award , took a no-hitter into the sixth inning or beyond three times , and extended his undefeated road start streak to 24 games . This streak made Young one of only three pitchers in major league history to have gone at least 23 straight road starts without a loss ; Allie Reynolds set the record at 25 straight road starts spanning the 1948 and 1949 seasons , with Russ Meyer falling one short , going undefeated in 24 straight road contests spanning the 1953 and 1954 seasons . In his first six starts after Memorial Day , he improved from a 3 \u2013 3 with a 4.32 ERA to 7 \u2013 3 with a 2.97 ERA , by allowing only four earned runs over 38 \u2154 innings . He was named one of five candidates from the National League for Major League Baseball 's \" All-Star Final Vote \" to determine the final official selection for the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game ; however , Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Nomar Garciaparra was elected . Nonetheless , his strong June performance \u2013 during which he allowed 16 hits and 13 walks over 30 \u2154 innings , maintained a 1.17 ERA and struck out 34 \u2013 earned him the National League Pitcher of the Month award . His five starts in June were highlighted by a career-best 12-strikeout performance on June 9 against the Florida Marlins and a June 21 win over his former team , the Texas Rangers . On September 22 , Young had a no-hitter through 8 \u2153 innings of the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run . This would have been the first no-hitter in Padres history . It was the first time a Padre had taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5 , 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves . Young had been on pace for a perfect game through 5 \u2154 innings . Young also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance . In that game , which marked the first time a pitcher took a no-hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season , he surrendered a double to Brad Hawpe , who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series , on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game . During Young 's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh , he did not allow a hit for the first 5 \u2153 innings , making him one of only two pitchers ( Steve Trachsel \u2013 June 20 \u2013 25 , 2002 ) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season . He ended the season by winning his first career postseason start ; on October 7 , he earned a 3 \u2013 1 victory in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals . He pitched 6 \u2154 shutout innings , struck out nine , walked two and allowed four hits . It remains the Padres ' only victory in ten post-season games against the Cardinals . The Padres lost the series three games to one . Young 's 6 \u2013 0 road performance in 2006 was one of 49 undefeated road seasons with at least five victories by a pitcher since post-season play began in 1903 . However , it was the first to be followed by a postseason road victory . In November , he traveled to Japan to take part in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series . Young was the starter in an exhibition game against the Yomiuri Giants , which was memorable for the major leaguers ' three-run ninth-inning rally to earn a tie . This game was the prelude to the five-game series which began with three games at the Tokyo Dome and was followed by games in Osaka and Fukuoka . Young pitched the fourth game of the series . Young also blogged on behalf of mlb.com about daily life during the trip . He detailed visits with United States Ambassador to Japan Tom Schieffer , time in the Harajuku , and travels on the Bullet Train . = = = = 2007 = = = = In his season debut on April 4 against the San Francisco Giants , Young became the 435th different pitcher to surrender a home run to Barry Bonds when he surrendered Bonds ' first of the season and 735th of his career . The game marked Young 's 25th consecutive road start without a loss . Young was 9 \u2013 0 during the streak , which ended in his subsequent road start on April 15 at Dodger Stadium in a 9 \u2013 3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers . The last of the nine other pitchers to go 20 consecutive road starts without a loss was Greg Maddux who went 22 starts without a loss during 1997 and 1998 . Young 's streak began on June 25 , 2005 . On April 10 , Young signed a four-year extension with the Padres through the 2010 season , reportedly worth $ 14.5 million with a club option for 2011 . On June 16 , Young threw a pitch that hit Chicago Cubs All-Star first baseman Derrek Lee on the back of the upper left arm . The day before the fracas , Alfonso Soriano homered off David Wells , and the Padres believed Soriano showed poor sportsmanship by admiring and celebrating his home run . The pitch nicked Lee 's left hand near his surgically repaired wrist . When the 6 ft 5 in ( 1.96 m ) Lee began walking towards first base , both he and Young , 6 ft 10 in ( 2.08 m ) , exchanged words , and a bench-clearing altercation ensued . Both Young and Lee were ejected from the game , along with Jake Peavy and Cubs bench coach Gerald Perry . On June 18 , Young and Lee were suspended five games each for their roles in the brawl , and Perry was suspended three games . All suspended parties were fined , as were Peavy and Brian Giles . Young and Lee appealed their suspensions , which were to begin the following day . At the time of the scuffle in the fourth inning , both pitchers were working on no-hitters . Young was ejected in the game , and he earned a no-decision in the game which the Padres ultimately won 1 \u2013 0 . On June 24 , Jake Peavy surrendered three earned runs in five innings , which caused his ERA to rise from 1.98 to 2.14 . This gave Young , who had a 2.08 ERA , the National League-leading average for one day . The next day , Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings to take the lead with a 2.04 ERA . On July 1 , Young was nominated as a candidate for the All-Star Final Vote , contending against Tom Gorzelanny , Roy Oswalt , Brandon Webb and Carlos Zambrano . In a bid for the final spot on July 4 , Young posted seven scoreless innings in a 1 \u2013 0 victory over the Florida Marlins to not only retake the National League ERA lead , but also assume the major league lead over Brad Penny by a slim margin ( 1.9968 to 1.9970 ) . The voting ended on July 5 , with Young defeating the four opposing pitchers to earn his first career All-Star Game selection . The selection made Young the sixth Ivy League athlete named to the All-Star team ( joining Lou Gehrig , Red Rolfe , Ron Darling , Brad Ausmus and Mike Remlinger ) . Young entered the All-Star break with the major league lead in ERA and opponent batting average as well as an undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals . Prior to the announcement of his election , Young dropped his appeal of the five-game suspension . Young served his suspension during the final four games before the All-Star break and the first game afterwards , yet was allowed to play in the All-Star Game at AT & T Park in San Francisco , California . In the fifth inning of the 5 \u2013 4 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher , he surrendered the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki . He was placed on the disabled list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during the third inning of his July 24 start . On August 9 , he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start . He took a 12-start ( five-decision ) undefeated streak , dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals , into his first start off the disabled list , but he took the loss in a 5 \u2013 0 defeat , which was again against the Cardinals . Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings , but also in stolen bases allowed ( with 44 ) . He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start . = = = = 2008 = = = = Young started the season in the second spot in the Padres rotation between ace Peavy and Maddux . He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation . On April 18 , he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation . Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation . The number three spot in the rotation is the only one that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12 \u2013 15 , 2008 . Young , thus , did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007 . On May 21 , 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals , Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols . Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose . Later in the same inning , Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate . Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks . Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux , who had become a Los Angeles Dodger , earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list . Then , on September 7 he came within four outs of perfection when Milwaukee Brewers ' Gabe Kapler hit a one-out home run in the eighth inning . He allowed two hits , did not walk a batter and struck out five , en route to 10 \u2013 1 victory at Milwaukee 's Miller Park . Young did not get his first perfect game or first no-hitter , but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts . Two starts later he hit his first home run as a major league batter . = = = = 2009 = = = = After starting the season with a 4 \u2013 2 record , Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the disabled list . His final start occurred on June 14 . He was initially placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 19 , but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list . In August , he had season ending arthroscopic surgery to repair partial tears in his labrum . He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation . = = = = 2010 = = = = Young pitched six shutout innings in the second game of the season before being pulled with a right shoulder strain . He missed almost the entire season except for three starts near the end of the season , finishing the season 2 \u2013 0 with a 0.90 ERA . In November , the Padres declined to pick up the option for 2011 . In 2010 , he was chosen as the eighth-smartest athlete in sports by Sporting News . = = = New York Mets = = = = = = = 2011 = = = = On January 17 , 2011 , Young signed a contract with the New York Mets worth $ 1.1 million with the ability to reach up to $ 4.5 million through incentives . In his first career start with the Mets on April 5 , 2011 , Young went five and a third innings while striking out seven batters , recording the victory in a 7 \u2013 1 Mets win over the Philadelphia Phillies . He also went three for three at the plate with two runs batted in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels . In that game , Young became the first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning . Shortly after the start of the season , Young sustained an arm injury which forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list . Following the season , he was a free agent . = = = = 2012 = = = = On March 26 , 2012 , Young signed on a minor league deal with the Mets .

He spent the first 33 days of the season on the triple A Buffalo Bisons ' disabled list before being activated on May 10 . Young subsequently made three starts with the single A St. Lucie Mets on May 11 , May 16 and 25 before being promoted back to Buffalo on May 27 . He compiled a 1 \u2013 0 record with 3.18 ERA in 17.0 innings during the three starts . On May 31 , he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Bisons against the Columbus Clippers . The Mets announced on June 4 that they would call Young up to the major league roster on June 5 . On June 5 , 2012 , Young made his return against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park with the Mets , giving up 3 runs ( 2 earned ) over 5 innings in a game that was eventually decided in 12 innings . On June 6 his wife gave birth and he was placed on a paternity leave , which was not intended to interfere with his June 10 scheduled start . The move was for the purpose of freeing up a roster spot during Young 's off days under a Major League Baseball rule that allows for a three-day leave . Young made his next start on June 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays , earning his first win in over a year . = = = Washington Nationals = = = = = = = 2013 \u2013 14 = = = = On February 21 , 2013 , Young signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals and an invitation to training camp . On March 26 , 2013 he was granted his unconditional release by the Nationals after opting out of his contract . He was re-signed by the Nationals on April 4 , 2013 . He was then assigned to Triple-A Syracuse . He made his season debut on April 23 against Rochester , giving up 6 runs in 4.2 innings . He made 6 additional starts before going on the disabled list with a neck injury on May 28 , 2 days after leaving a start against Columbus after the first inning . He made 2 starts at the end of the year in the Gulf Coast League and with Short-Season Auburn before the end of the injury-marred season . In 9 total starts , he went 1 \u2013 2 with a 6.81 ERA , striking out 21 in 37 innings . After experiencing pain in his shoulder and neck , he had surgery to repair what was diagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome . This condition is a nerve problem that puts pressure on a pitcher \u2019 s shoulder . On November 19 , 2013 , Young re-signed with the Nationals on a minor league deal . He was released on March 25 , 2014 . = = = Seattle Mariners = = = = = = = 2014 = = = = Young signed a highly incentivized one-year deal with the Seattle Mariners on March 27 , 2014 . Young was scheduled to debut as a starter for the Mariners on April 4 . However , the Oakland Coliseum had its first rainout since 1998 . As a result , after 159 Major League starts and 102 Minor League starts , Young made his first appearance as a relief pitcher ( other than the 2007 All-Star Game ) and he pitched two shutout innings on April 6 against the Oakland A 's later in that series . He made his first Major League start since September 9 , 2012 on April 13 against Oakland . He posted six scoreless innings , while scattering 4 hits and 3 walks . By early June , Young was in the conversation for Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award , with a 5 \u2013 2 start and 3.27 ERA , according to MLB.com 's Adam Lewis . In helping to stabilize a rotation battered by injuries and ineffectual fifth starters , Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon was unabashed in his praise of the right-hander at the time , calling him a \" godsend . \" Young finished the season with a 12 \u2013 9 record and a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts . His 7.8 hits per nine innings was the sixth in the AL . Following the season , Young was recognized with the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award , The Sporting News American League Comeback Player of the Year Award , and Players Choice Comeback Player of the Year Award . At the conclusion of the season , Young became a free agent . = = = Kansas City Royals = = = = = = = 2015 = = = = On March 7 , 2015 , Young signed with the Kansas City Royals . Young entered the season in the long reliever role with the Royals . He appeared in the Royals ' sixth game on April 12 against the Los Angeles Angels with two scoreless innings as the Royals started the season 6 \u2013 0 . Young made his first start with the Royals on May 1 . He tossed five no-hit innings against the Detroit Tigers . On June 16 , Young posted 7 shutout innings and 3 runs batted in against the Milwaukee Brewers , becoming the first Royals pitcher to tally 3 RBI in a game since 1972 . After achieving a record of 8 \u2013 6 with a 3.25 ERA through the end of July , Young was returned to the bullpen on July 31 after posting a 5.11 ERA over a 5-game stretch . On September 27 ( one day after his father died ) , Young made his first start since July 28 and pitched 5 no-hit innings against the Cleveland Indians . On October 20 , Young started and pitched 4 2 / 3 innings in a game 4 victory in the 2015 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays . It was Young 's first postseason start since the 2006 National League Division Series . He earned the win in the October 27 game 1 of the 2015 World Series when he shut down the New York Mets , giving up a walk and no hits while striking out 4 over the final three innings , to help the Royals win 5 \u2013 4 in 14 innings . = = = = 2016 = = = = On December 7 , 2015 , the Royals announced that they had signed Young to a two-year $ 11.75 million contract with mutual third-year option . After beginning the 2016 season with a record of 1-5 in 7 starts , Young was placed on the disabled list with a strained right forearm from May 12 to May 28 . = = Player profile = = = = = Pitching style = = = Young is not a traditional power pitcher . He is said to be a control pitcher in a 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) power pitcher 's body \u2014 his pitching style is more like Greg Maddux 's than that of five-time Cy Young Award winner Randy Johnson , who is the same height as Young . Young has been traded three times partly because of the low velocity of his fastball , which is in the 83 \u2013 87 miles per hour ( 133.6 \u2013 140 km / h ) range . Young has learned how to use precise location to make his fastball effective . He has also been compared to another control pitcher , Jim Palmer , because Young similarly induces popups and fly ball outs with deceptive late movement on his high fastballs . Over 50 % of the balls put in play against him are fly balls . Of the flyballs hit off Young in 2007 , 3.8 % were home runs. while the average is about 11 % . From 2003 to 2006 the best single-season percentage was 6.2 % by Dontrelle Willis in 2005 . Young 's mid-2000s repertoire included fastballs , curveballs , sliders and changeups . His curveball is a slow curveball and his 85 miles per hour ( 137 km / h ) fastball has been described by former teammate and catcher Mike Piazza as having late life and late movement that seems to jump . His curveball is used to keep the hitters off balance so that they do not jump on his low-velocity fastball . Former Ranger pitching coach Orel Hershiser says Young has the ability to throw his fastball to all locations effectively which gives him a chance at success . Hershiser describes Young 's pitches as sneaky fast because his methodical delivery and size give him deception . This delivery has also left him susceptible to stolen bases due to the relatively long time it takes for him to deliver a pitch from the stretch . By 2012 , nearly all of his pitches were fastballs or sliders . = = = Batting = = = As of the end of the 2015 season , Young has a career .150 batting average , including 31 hits , eight of which were extra base hits ( six doubles , one triple , and one home run ) . He has yet to record a stolen base . The only Princeton players who have hit a home run or recorded a stolen base at least once during their careers , along with Young , are Moe Berg , Dutch Sterrett , Homer Hillebrand , Dutch Meier , Ted Reed , Bobby Vaughn , and Will Venable . Venable is the most recent player to have accomplished the feat . These same players join Young as Princeton alumni to have hit a home run . Berg had been the last to do so before Young hit his home run on September 20 , 2008 . = = Personal life = = Young 's wife , Elizabeth Patrick , is the granddaughter of Lester Patrick , who was the namesake of the National Hockey League 's Patrick Division and the Lester Patrick Trophy . She was also a member of the Princeton University class of 2002 , and she attends law school in Washington , D.C. On March 4 , 2008 , she was induced into labor four days before her due date to deliver a girl named Catherine Elizabeth .

                    "text": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A.

Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P. Bradley \u2013 1870 Ward Hunt \u2013 1873 Morrison Remick Waite ( Chief Justice ) \u2013 1874 = = = States admitted to the Union = = = Colorado \u2013 August 1 , 1876 Colorado came into the Union just in time to give enough electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

Originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4 , it was recast as a very long-range bomber with fuel-conserving diesel engines before production of the single prototype began in December 1942 . Flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved to be hard to start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements . Further development was canceled in 1944 . = = Development = = Outwardly similar to the Il-4 , the Il-6 was faster and had a longer and slimmer fuselage fitted with a completely new , highly tapered wing with an aspect ratio of 8 . The engine nacelles were streamlined to reduce drag and increase speed as the engine radiators were mounted in the wing center section , fed by slits in the leading edge of the wing . Defensive armament was greatly improved with five 20 mm ( 0.79 in ) cannon fitted on flexible mountings in the nose , dorsal turret , two waist positions and a ventral blister forward of the tailplane . The Il-6 was originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4 . But after the initial design was completed in August 1942 , the VVS requested that the bomber have extended range instead of high speed . So the original M-71 radial engines were replaced by Charomskiy ACh-30 diesel engines with low fuel consumption which promised to give the Il-6 the required range , especially when operated at moderate weights . The revised design was completed in December 1942 and production of the prototype was initiated . First flight of the Il-6 was made in Irkutsk on 7 August 1943 with lower-powered ACh-30B engines substituted for the unavailable ACh-30BF engines . Flight tests revealed difficult handling , and a lack of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines . Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF 's were fitted between May and July 1944 . Despite modifications , the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance . Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air , but were found to be very difficult to start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements .

                    "text": "Handley Page Victor = The Handley Page Victor is a British jet-powered strategic bomber , developed and produced by the Handley Page Aircraft Company , which served during the Cold War . It was the third and final of the V-bombers operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , the other two V-bombers being the Avro Vulcan and the Vickers Valiant . The Victor had been developed to perform as part of the United Kingdom \u2019 s airborne nuclear deterrent . In 1968 , the type was retired from the nuclear mission following the discovery of fatigue cracks , which had been exacerbated by the RAF 's adoption of a low-altitude flight profile to avoid interception . A number of Victors had received modifications to undertake the strategic reconnaissance role , employing a combination of radar , cameras , and other sensors . As the nuclear deterrence mission was given to the Royal Navy 's submarine-launched Polaris missiles in 1969 , a large V-bomber fleet was deemed surplus to requirements . Consequently , many of the surviving Victors were converted into aerial refuelling tankers . During the Falklands War , Victor tankers were notably used in the airborne logistics operation to repeatedly refuel Vulcan bombers on their way to and from the Black Buck raids . The Victor was the last of the V-bombers to be retired , the final aircraft being removed from service on 15 October 1993 . In its refuelling role , the type had been replaced by the Vickers VC10 and the Lockheed Tristar . = = Development = = = = = Origins = = = The origin of the Victor and the other V bombers is heavily linked with the early British atomic weapons programme and nuclear deterrent policies that developed in the aftermath of the Second World War . The atom bomb programme formally began with Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.1001 issued in August 1946 , which anticipated a government decision in January 1947 to authorise research and development work on atomic weapons , the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1946 ( McMahon Act ) having prohibited exporting atomic knowledge , even to countries that had collaborated on the Manhattan Project . OR.1001 envisaged a weapon not to exceed 24 ft 2 in ( 7.37 m ) in length , 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) in diameter , 10,000 lb ( 4,500 kg ) in weight , and suitable for release from 20,000 ft ( 6,100 m ) to 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) . At the same time , the Air Ministry drew up requirements for bombers to replace the existing piston-engined heavy bombers such as the Avro Lancaster and the new Avro Lincoln which equipped RAF Bomber Command . In January 1947 , the Ministry of Supply distributed Specification B.35 / 46 to aviation companies to satisfy Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.229 for \" a medium range bomber landplane capable of carrying one 10,000 lb ( 4,500 kg ) bomb to a target 1,500 nautical miles ( 1,700 mi ; 2,800 km ) from a base which may be anywhere in the world . \" A cruising speed of 500 knots ( 580 mph ; 930 km / h ) at heights between 35,000 ft ( 11,000 m ) and 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) was specified . The maximum weight when fully loaded ought not to exceed 100,000 lb ( 45,000 kg ) . The weapons load was to include a 10,000 lb \" Special gravity bomb \" ( i.e. a free-fall nuclear weapon ) , or over shorter ranges 20,000 lb ( 9,100 kg ) of conventional bombs . No defensive weapons were to be carried , the aircraft relying on its speed and height to avoid opposing fighters . The similar OR.230 required a \" long range bomber \" with a 2,000 nautical miles ( 2,300 mi ; 3,700 km ) radius of action at a height of 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) , a cruise speed of 575 mph ( 925 km / h ) , and a maximum weight of 200,000 lb ( 91,000 kg ) when fully loaded . Responses to OR.230 were received from Short Brothers , Bristol , and Handley Page ; however , the Air Ministry recognised that developing an aircraft to meet these stringent requirements would have been technically demanding and so expensive that the resulting bomber could only be purchased in small numbers . As a result , realising that the majority of likely targets would not require such a long range , a less demanding specification for a medium-range bomber , Air Ministry Specification B.35 / 46 was issued . This demanded the ability to carry the same 10,000 lb bomb-load to a target 1,500 nmi ( 1,725 mi , 2,800 km ) away at a height of 45,000 \u2013 50,000 ft ( 13,700 \u2013 15,200 m ) at a speed of 575 mph . = = = HP.80 = = = The design proposed by Handley Page in response to B.35 / 46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance , Handley Page 's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy , Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80 ; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip , to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed . Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs , which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead ; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted , full tailplane was adopted instead . The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages , particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behavior in flight . The HP.80 and Avro 's Type 698 were chosen as the best two of the proposed designs to B.35 / 46 , and orders for two prototypes of each were placed . It was recognised , however , that there were many unknowns associated with both designs , and an order was also placed for Vickers ' design , which became the Valiant . Although not fully meeting the requirements of the specification , the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier . The HP.80 's crescent wing was tested on a \u2153 -scale glider , the HP.87 , and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker , which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation . The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence . By the time the HP.88 was ready , the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative . The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme . Two HP.80 prototypes , WB771 and WB775 , were built . WB771 was broken down at the Handley Page factory at Radlett and transported by road to RAF Boscombe Down for its first flight ; bulldozers were used to clear the route and create paths around obstacles . Sections of the aircraft were hidden under wooden framing and tarpaulins printed with \" GELEYPANDHY / SOUTHAMPTON \" to make it appear as a boat hull in transit . GELEYPANDHY was an anagram of \" Handley Pyge \" marred by a signwriter 's error . On 24 December 1952 , piloted by Handley Page 's chief test pilot Hedley Hazelden , WB771 made its maiden flight , which lasted for a total of 17 minutes . Ten days later , the Air Ministry announced the aircraft 's official name to be Victor . The prototypes performed well ; however , several design failings led to the loss of WB771 on 14 July 1954 , when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield , causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew . Attached to the fin using three bolts , the tailplane was subject to considerably more stress than had been anticipated , and the three bolts failed due to metal fatigue . Additionally , the prototypes were considerably tail heavy due to the lack of equipment in the nose ; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes . Production Victors had a lengthened nose that also served to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes . The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the tailplane attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing . = = = Victor B.1 = = = Production B.1 Victors were powered by the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 turbojets rated at 11,000 lbf ( 49 kN ) , and was initially equipped with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon , re-equipping with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available , although Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs ( made available under the Project E programme ) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon . A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard by the addition of Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tailcone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) from 1958 to 1960 . On 1 June 1956 , a production Victor XA917 flown by test pilot Johnny Allam inadvertently exceeded the speed of sound after Allam let the nose drop slightly at a higher power setting . Allam noticed a cockpit indication of Mach 1.1 and ground observers from Watford to Banbury reported hearing a sonic boom . The Victor maintained stability throughout the event . Aviation author Andrew Brookes has claimed that Allam broke the sound barrier knowingly to demonstrate the Victor 's superiority to the earlier V-bombers . The Victor was the largest aircraft to have broken the sound barrier at that time . = = = Victor B.2 = = = The RAF required a higher ceiling for its bombers , and a number of proposals were considered for improved Victors to meet this demand . At first , Handley Page proposed use of the 14,000 lbf ( 62.4 kN ) Sapphire 9 engines to produce a \" Phase 2 \" bomber , to be followed by \" Phase 3 \" Victors with much greater wingspan ( 137 ft ( 42 m ) ) and powered by Bristol Siddeley Olympus turbojets or Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans . The Sapphire 9 was cancelled , however , and the heavily modified Phase 3 aircraft would have delayed production , so an interim \" Phase 2A \" Victor was proposed and accepted , to be powered by the Conway and having minimal modifications . The \" Phase 2A \" proposal was accepted by the Air Staff as the Victor B.2 , with Conway RCo.11 engines providing 17,250 lbf ( 76.7 kN ) . The new Conway engines required redesigned enlarged intakes to provide the greater airflow required . The wingtips were extended , increasing the wingspan to 120 ft ( 36.6 m ) . The B.2 featured distinctive retractable \" elephant ear \" intakes not found on the B.1 , located on the rear fuselage forward of the tail fin . These scoops fed ram air to Ram Air Turbines ( RAT ) which could provide electrical power during emergency situations , such as engine failure , during flight . The first prototype Victor B.2 , serial number XH668 made its maiden flight on 20 February 1959 . It had flown 100 hours by 20 August 1959 , when , while high-altitude engine tests were being carried out by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment ( A & AEE ) , it disappeared from radar screens , crashing into the sea off the coast of Pembrokeshire . An extensive search operation was initiated to locate and salvage the wreckage of XH668 to determine the cause of the crash . It took until November 1960 to recover most of the aircraft ; the accident investigation concluded that the starboard pitot head had failed inflight , causing the flight control system to force the aircraft into an unrecoverable dive . Only minor changes were needed to resolve this problem , allowing the Victor B.2 to enter service in February 1962 . = = = Further development = = = A total of 21 B.2 aircraft were upgraded to the B.2R standard with Conway RCo.17 engines ( 20,600 lbf or 92 kN thrust ) and facilities to carry a Blue Steel stand-off nuclear missile . Their wings were modified to incorporate two \" speed pods \" or \" K\u00fcchemann carrots \" . These were anti-shock bodies ; bulged fairings that reduced wave drag at transonic speeds ( see area rule ) , which were also used as a convenient place to house chaff dispensers . Handley Page proposed to build a further refined \" Phase 6 \" Victor , with more fuel and capable of carrying up to four Skybolt ( AGM-48 ) ballistic missiles on standing airborne patrols , but this proposal was rejected although it was agreed that some of the Victor B.2s on order would be fitted to carry two Skybolts . This plan was abandoned when the U.S. cancelled the whole Skybolt programme in 1963 . With the move to low-level penetration missions , the Victors were fitted with air-to-air refuelling probes above the cockpit and received large underwing fuel tanks . Nine B.2 aircraft were converted for strategic reconnaissance purposes to replace Valiants which had been withdrawn due to wing fatigue , with delivery beginning in July 1965 . These aircraft received a variety of cameras , a bomb bay-mounted radar mapping system and wing top sniffers to detect particles released from nuclear testing . Designated Victor SR.2 , a single aircraft could photograph the whole of the United Kingdom in a single two-hour sortie . Different camera configurations could be installed in the bomb bay , including up to four F49 survey cameras and up to eight F96 cameras could be fitted to take vertical or oblique daylight photography ; nighttime photography required the fitting of F89 cameras . = = = Aerial refuelling conversion = = = The withdrawal of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft , so the B.1 / 1A aircraft , now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role , were refitted for this duty . To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible , six B.1A aircraft were converted to B ( K ) .1A standard ( later redesignated B.1A ( K2P ) ) , receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried under each wing , while the bomb bay remained available for weapons . Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft , with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965 , and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965 . While these six aircraft provided a limited tanker capability suitable for refuelling fighters , the Mk 20A wing hosereels could only deliver fuel at a limited rate , and were not suitable for refuelling bombers . Work therefore continued to produce a definitive three-point tanker conversion of the Victor Mk.1. Fourteen further B.1A and 11 B.1 were fitted with two permanently fitted fuel tanks in the bomb bay , and a high-capacity Mk 17 centreline hose dispenser unit with three times the fuel flow rate as the wing reels , and were designated K.1A and K.1 respectively . The remaining B.2 aircraft were not as suited to the low-level mission profile that the RAF had adopted for carrying out strategic bombing missions as the Vulcan with its strong delta wing . This , combined with the switch of the nuclear deterrent from the RAF to the Royal Navy ( with the Polaris missile ) meant that the Victors were considered to be surplus to requirements . Hence , 24 B.2 were modified to K.2 standard . Similar to the K.1 / 1A conversions , the wing was trimmed to reduce stress and the bomb aimer 's nose glazing was plated over . During 1982 , the glazing was reintroduced on some aircraft , the former nose bomb aimer 's position having been used to mount F95 cameras in order to perform reconnaissance missions during the Falklands War . The K.2 could carry 91,000 lb ( 41,000 kg ) of fuel . It served in the tanker role until withdrawn in October 1993 . = = Design = = = = = Overview = = = The Victor was a futuristic-looking , streamlined aircraft , with four turbojet engines buried in the thick wing roots . Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes , and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar , cockpit , nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer 's position . It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes to act as an escape pod , but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950 . The Victor had a five-man crew , comprising the two pilots seated side-by-side and three rearward-facing crew , these being the navigator / plotter , the navigator / radar operator , and the air electronics officer ( AEO ) . Unlike the Vulcan and Valiant , the Victor 's pilots sat at the same level as the rest of the crew , thanks to a larger pressurised compartment that extended all the way to the nose . As with the other V-bombers , only the pilots were provided with ejection seats ; the three systems operators relying on \" explosive cushions \" inflated by a CO2 bottle that would help them from their seats and towards a traditional bail out in the event of high g-loading , but despite this , escape for the three backseaters was extremely difficult . While assigned to the nuclear delivery role , the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme , designed to protect the aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation . The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft ; paler variations of RAF 's roundels were also applied for this same reason . When the V-bombers were assigned to the low-level approach profile in the 1960s , the Victors were soon repainted in green / grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation ; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft . = = = Armaments and equipment = = = The Victor 's bomb bay was much larger than that of the Valiant and Vulcan , which allowed heavier weapon loads to be carried at the cost of range . As an alternative to the single \" 10,000 lb \" nuclear bomb as required by the specification , the bomb bay was designed to carry several conventional armaments , including a single 22,000 lb ( 10,000 kg ) Grand Slam or two 12,000 lb ( 5,500 kg ) Tallboy earthquake bombs , up to forty-eight 1,000 lb ( 450 kg ) bombs or thirty-nine 2,000 lb ( 900 kg ) sea mines . One proposed addition to the Victor were underwing panniers capable of carrying a further 28 1,000 lb bombs to supplement the main bomb bay , but this option was not pursued . In addition to a range of free-fall nuclear bombs , later Victor B.2s operated as missile carriers for standoff nuclear missiles such as Blue Steel ; it had been intended for the American Skybolt missile to be introduced ; however , development of Skybolt was cancelled . Target information for Blue Steel could be input during flight , as well in advance of the mission . It was reported that , with intensive work , a B.2 missile carrier could revert to carrying free-fall nuclear weapons or conventional munitions within 30 hours . Like its sibling V-Bombers , the Victor made use of the Navigational and Bombing System ( NBS ) ; a little-used optical sight had also been installed upon early aircraft . For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes , the Victor employed numerous radar systems . These included the H2S radar , the first airborne ground-scanning radar , and the Green Satin radar . Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus . Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from , or shared concepts with , those used on Handley Page 's preceding Halifax bomber . Operationally , the accuracy of the bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards , which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations . = = = Avionics and systems = = = The Victor had fully duplicated powered controls ; many of the flight controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies . Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system . This setup was developed to provide , amongst other capabilities , a level of artificial feel to the pilot . Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft , which comprised the alighting gear , flaps , nose flaps , air brakes , bomb doors , wheel brakes , nose-wheel steering , and the ram-air turbine scoops . An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2 , electrical reliability being noticeably improved . To evade enemy detection and interception efforts , the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) suite which were operated by the air electronics officer ( AEO ) , who had primary responsibility for the aircraft 's electronics and communication systems . The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar in the vicinity of the aircraft , and to provide situational awareness for the crew . Enemy communications could also be jammed , and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective . The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment . Some of the ECM equipment which initially saw use on the Victor , such as the original chaff dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar , had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete by the time the Victor had entered service . Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites , as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor 's role ; for example , the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar . The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems , including a passive radar warning receiver , a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment . Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff / flares were also new additions . While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar , neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet . = = = Engines = = = The Victor B.1 was powered by an arrangement of four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines . The engines were embedded in pairs into the aircraft 's wing root ; because of the high mounted position of the wing , the tail had to adopt a high mounting to maintain clearance of the jet turbulence , however the airbrakes were ideally situated to take advantage of this phenomenon . Difficulties were encountered with the Sapphires when stationed in tropical environments ; several engines were destroyed by the turbine blades striking the outer engine casing . The Victor B.2 adopted the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan ; the Conway at one point held the distinction of being the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside of the Soviet Union , and were significantly more powerful than the preceding Sapphire engines employed upon on the B.1. The Victor B.2 featured a distinct change in the aircraft 's engine arrangements ; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit ( AAPU ) , effectively a small fifth engine . The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines , and also providing electrical power on the ground or alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures . The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment . Turbine-driven alternators , otherwise known as ram air turbines ( RATs ) , had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost . Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs , which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls . In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit . = = = Flight profile = = = The Victor was commonly described as having good handling and excellent performance , along with favourable low speed flight characteristics . During the flight tests of the first prototype , the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance , flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems ; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft . Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers . At low altitude , the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner , in part due to its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing . One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability ; once lined up with the runway , the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink , giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot . The Victor has been described as an agile aircraft , atypical for a large bomber aircraft ; in 1958 , a Victor had performed several loops and a barrel roll during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow . Manoeuverability was greatly enabled by the light controls , quick response of the aircraft , and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable tail-mounted airbrake . The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds , although multiple instances have occurred in which the sound barrier was broken . During development of the Victor B.2 , the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuverability , which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft 's height and range performance . = = Operational history = = The Victor was the last of the V bombers to enter service , with deliveries of B.1s to No. 232 Operational Conversion Unit RAF based at RAF Gaydon , Warwickshire before the end of 1957 . The first operational bomber squadron , 10 Squadron , formed at RAF Cottesmore in April 1958 , with a second squadron , 15 Squadron forming before the end of the year . Four Victors , fitted with Yellow Astor reconnaissance radar , together with a number of passive sensors , were used to equip a secretive unit , the Radar Reconnaissance Flight at RAF Wyton . The Victor bomber force continued to build up , with 57 Squadron forming in March 1959 and 55 Squadron in October 1960 . At its height , the Victor was simultaneously operating with six squadrons of RAF Bomber Command . According to the operational doctrine developed by the RAF , in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike , each Victor would have operated entirely independently ; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon the effectiveness of their individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target ; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime . Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important ; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years , and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel . In order to maximize the operational lifespan of each aircraft , Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week . Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection , refuelling and turnaround operations . In times of high international tension , the V-bombers would be dispersed and have been maintained at a high state of readiness ; if the order was given to deploy a nuclear strike , Victors at high readiness would have been airborne in under four minutes from the point the order had been issued . British intelligence had estimated that the Soviet 's radar network was capable of detecting the Victor at up to 200 miles away , so to avoid interception , the Victor would follow carefully planned routes to exploit weaknesses in the Soviet detection network . This tactic was employed in conjunction with the Victor 's extensive onboard electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) to increase the chances of evasion . Whilst originally the Victor would have maintained high altitude flight throughout a nuclear strike mission , rapid advances of the Soviet anti-aircraft warfare capabilities ( exemplified by the downing of a U2 from 70,000 ft in 1960 ) led to this tactic being abandoned : a low-level high-speed approach supported by increasingly sophisticated ECMs was adopted in its place . The improved Victor B.2 started to be delivered in 1961 , with the first B.2 Squadron , 139 Squadron forming in February 1962 , and a second , 100 Squadron in May 1962 . These were the only two bomber squadrons to form on the B.2 , as the last 28 Victors on order were cancelled . The prospect of Skybolt ballistic missiles , with which each V-bomber could strike at two separate targets , meant that fewer bombers would be needed , while the government were unhappy with Sir Frederick Handley Page 's resistance to their pressure to merge his company with competitors . While Skybolt 's development would be terminated , Victor B.2s were retrofitted as carrier aircraft for the Blue Steel standoff nuclear missile . The introduction of standoff weapons and the switch to low-level flight in order to evade radar detection was said to be decisive factors in the successful penetration of enemy territory . In 1964 \u2013 1965 , a series of detachments of Victor B.1As was deployed to RAF Tengah , Singapore as a deterrent against Indonesia during the Borneo conflict , the detachments fulfilling a strategic deterrent role as part of Far East Air Force , while also giving valuable training in low-level flight and visual bombing . In September 1964 , with the confrontation with Indonesia reaching a peak , the detachment of four Victors was prepared for rapid dispersal , with two aircraft loaded with live conventional bombs and held on one-hour readiness , ready to fly operational sorties . However , they were never required to fly combat missions and the high readiness alert finished at the end of the month . Following the discovery of fatigue cracks , developing due to their low-altitude usage , the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage by the end of 1968 . The RAF had experienced intense demand upon its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet , and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s , thus it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also . Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks , the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings , and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers . The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation . The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley , who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page , with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life . While the Victor was never permanently based with any units stationed overseas , temporary deployments were frequently conducted , often in a ceremonial capacity or to participate in training exercises and competitions . Victor squadrons were dispatched on several extended deployments to the Far East , and short term deployments to Canada were also conducted for training purposes . At one point during the early 1960s , South Africa showed considerable interest in the acquisition of several bomber-configured Victors ; in the end , the Victor would not serve with any other operator other than the RAF . Several of the Victor B.2s had been converted for Strategic Reconnaissance mission following the retirement of the Valiant in this capacity . In service , this type was primarily used in surveillance of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas , capable of surveying 400,000 square miles in an eight-hour mission ; they were also used to sample the fallout from French nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific . Originally reconnaissance Victors were equipped for visual reconnaissance ; however , it was found to be cheaper to assign Canberra light bombers to this duty and as such the cameras were removed in 1970 . Subsequently , radar-based reconnaissance was emphasised in the type 's role . The reconnaissance Victors remained in use until 1974 when they followed the standard bombers into the tanker conversion line ; a handful of modified Avro Vulcans assumed the maritime radar reconnaissance role in their place . Two of the V-bombers , the Victor and the Vulcan , played a high-profile role during the 1982 Falklands War . In order to cross the vast distance of the Atlantic Ocean , a single Vulcan required refuelling several times from Victor tankers . A total of three bombing missions were flown against Argentine forces deployed to the Falklands , with approximately 1.1 million gal ( 5 million L ) of fuel consumed in each mission . At the time , these missions held the record for the world 's longest-distance bombing raids . The deployment of other assets to the theatre , such as the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod and Lockheed Hercules , required the support of the Victor tanker fleet , which had been temporarily relocated to RAF Ascension Island for the campaign . The Victor also undertook several reconnaissance missions over the South Atlantic . These missions provided valuable intelligence for the retaking of South Georgia by British forces . Following the invasion of Kuwait by neighbouring Iraq in 1991 , a total of eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War . RAF strike aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado would frequently make use of the tanker to refuel prior to launching cross-border strikes inside of Iraq . Shortly after the Gulf War , the remaining Victor fleet was quickly retired in 1993 , at which point it had been the last of the three V-bombers in operational service ; retiring nine years after the last Vulcan , although the Vulcan had survived longer in its original role as a bomber . = = Variants = = HP.80 Prototype , two aircraft built .

                    "text": "Blackburn Firebrand = The Blackburn Firebrand was a British single-engine strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft . Originally intended to serve as a pure fighter , its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability . Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until after the end of the war . Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953 . = = Development = = In general , the Fleet Air Arm had required fighters that were capable of navigating long ranges over sea and speed differential over attackers was not critical . However , while defence of British naval bases was a RAF commitment , provision had not been made for this and so the Admiralty accepted that it would have to take on the duty . For this it needed an interceptor fighter . Experience in the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 had also shown a high-performance , carrier-based , single-seat fighter would be an advantage . Blackburn tendered their B-37 design using the Napier Sabre 24-cylinder H-type engine , and this was accepted by June 1940 with a proposal to order \" off the drawing board \" ( meaning without prototypes ) . Air Ministry Specification N.11 / 40 \u2014 stating a minimum top speed of 350 knots ( 650 km / h ; 400 mph ) \u2014 was raised to cover this design and an order placed in January 1941 for three prototypes . The B-37 , given the service name \" Firebrand \" on 11 July 1941 , was a low-winged , all-metal monoplane . Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque , but forward it had a circular-section , tubular-steel frame that housed the 169-imperial-gallon ( 770 l ; 203 US gal ) main fuel tank and the 71-imperial-gallon ( 320 l ; 85 US gal ) auxiliary fuel tank behind the engine . The radiators for the neatly cowled Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions . The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually folded outer panels ( with 5 degrees of dihedral ) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers . To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large , hydraulically powered Fowler flaps that extended to the edges of the Frise ailerons . The fixed armament of four 20 mm ( 0.79 in ) Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun . The vertical stabilizer and rudder were positioned forward of the horizontal stabilizer to ensure spin recovery and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness . The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the centre wing section and retracted inwards . The Firebrand was unusual in that there was an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings , presaging the development of the modern heads-up display . The unarmed first prototype first flew on 27 February 1942 using the Sabre II , the first of two armed prototypes following on 15 July . The initial flight trials were a disappointment as the aircraft could only reach 32 mph ( 51 km / h ) below Blackburn 's estimated maximum speed of 390 mph . Replacement of the Sabre II with a Sabre III ( an engine built specifically for the Firebrand ) improved its top speed to 358 mph ( 576 km / h ) . The second prototype , DD810 , conducted deck-landing trials , with Commander Dennis Cambell at the controls , aboard the fleet carrier HMS Illustrious in February 1943 . The Sabre engine was also used in the Hawker Typhoon , a fighter already in production , and the Ministry of Air Production ( MAP ) decided that the Typhoon had priority for the Sabre . The Sabre was also experiencing production problems and so a new engine was needed , along with the necessary airframe improvements to accommodate it ; rather than abandon the time and effort invested in the design , the MAP decided to convert the Firebrand into an interim strike fighter to meet the Fleet Air Arm 's requirement for a single-seat torpedo bomber capable of carrying bombs and rockets as well as engaging in air-to-air combat . Nine production F. Mk I aircraft were built to the original specifications and all were retained for trials and development work . After it was badly damaged during an emergency landing , DD810 was converted into a prototype of the first strike variant , the Firebrand T.F. Mk II ( with the company designation B-45 ) , that flew on 31 March 1943 . It was an adaptation of the Mk I with the wing centre section widened by 1 foot 3.5 inches ( 39.4 cm ) to make room for the torpedo on the centreline between the mainwheels . Like the Mk I , the TF Mk II only saw a very limited production run of 12 aircraft and they were also allocated for development work , including those assigned to 708 Naval Air Squadron , a shore-based trials unit . Blackburn proposed several versions of the Sabre-powered aircraft including one for the RAF as the B-41 , a version with a high-lift wing as the B-42 , and the B-43 floatplane , none of which were accepted for further development . A new specification was issued as S.8 / 43 to cover the development of the Firebrand T.F. Mk III ( B-45 ) with the 2,400-horsepower ( 1,800 kW ) Bristol Centaurus VII radial engine . Two prototypes were converted from incomplete F Mk Is and 27 additional aircraft were delivered , completing the first batch of 50 aircraft . The first prototype flew on 21 December 1943 , but construction of the new aircraft was very slow with the first flight not being made until November 1944 . Most changes were related to the installation of the larger-diameter Centaurus engine , including air intakes for the carburetor and oil cooler in the wing-root extensions that formerly housed the engine 's radiators . Spring-loaded trim tabs were also fitted to all control surfaces . Production aircraft after the first 10 were fitted with the improved Centaurus IX engine . The Mk III was found to be unsuitable for carrier operations for a variety of reasons . The new engine produced more torque than the Sabre , and rudder control was insufficient on takeoff with the full flaps needed for carrier use . Visibility while landing was very poor , the tailhook attachment to the airframe was too weak , and the aircraft had a tendency to drop a wing at the stall while landing , so development continued to rectify these issues . The T.F. Mk IV ( B-46 ) , as the new development was designated , featured larger tail surfaces for better low-speed control . The enlarged rudder was horn balanced and the vertical stabilizer was offset three degrees to port to counteract the four-bladed Rotol propeller 's torque . The wings now featured hydraulically operated dive brakes on both upper and lower surfaces . The aircraft 's wings were now stressed to carry one 2,000-pound ( 910 kg ) bomb under each wing or a 45-imperial-gallon ( 200 l ; 54 US gal ) drop tank or eight RP-3 rockets . The frame that held the torpedo was connected to the undercarriage so that it pivoted nose-downward to increase ground clearance with the landing gear extended and pivoted upward to reduce drag while in flight . A 100-imperial-gallon ( 450 l ; 120 US gal ) fuel tank could be fitted on the centreline in lieu of the torpedo . The Mk IV first flew on 17 May 1945 , and was the first version of the Firebrand to enter mass production , with 170 built , although 50 more aircraft were cancelled . The later Firebrand T.F. Mk 5 featured minor aerodynamic improvements and 123 were converted from Mk IVs . The final version was the Firebrand T.F. Mk 5A with hydraulically boosted ailerons to increase the aircraft 's rate of roll . Two Mk 5s and five Mk IVs were converted to Mk 5A standard . = = Operational history = = The Firebrand did not see action in World War II , as TF 4s were not issued to 813 Naval Air Squadron until 1 September 1945 . The squadron was disbanded 30 September 1946 without ever deploying to sea . It was reformed with TF 5s on 1 May 1947 and flew them from the carrier HMS Implacable , later HMS Indomitable , until it was reequipped with turboprop Westland Wyvern attack aircraft in February 1953 . 827 Naval Air Squadron received their TF 5 and 5As on 13 December 1950 and flew them primarily off the carrier HMS Eagle until it disbanded on 19 November 1952 . A variety of second-line squadrons were issued Firebrands of various marks for training or trials at one time or another . In test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown 's opinion the aircraft was \" short of performance , sadly lacking in manoeuvrability , especially in rate of roll \" . Furthermore , the positioning of the cockpit even with the trailing edge of the wing gave the pilot a very poor view over the nose and inhibited his ability to view his target and to land his aircraft aboard a carrier , enough so that Brown called it \" a disaster as a deck-landing aircraft \" . = = Variants = = Blackburn B-37 Three prototypes ordered to meet Specification N.11 / 40 , named Firebrand on 11 July 1941 .

Intended to replace the Curtiss SOC Seagull in service as a scout aboard cruisers , it proved superior to the Curtiss SO3C in evaluation , but failed to win a production contract due to Vought 's lack of manufacturing capacity . = = Design and development = = In the late 1930s the United States Navy developed a set of specifications for a new scout-observation aircraft to operate from its cruisers in the reconnaissance and gunnery spotting roles . Intended to replace the Curtiss SOC biplane , the requirements included that the aircraft should have folding wings , have a superior range and speed to that of the SOC , and that the new type should be powered by the Ranger V-770 inline engine . Designs were submitted in response to the Navy 's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright . The Vought design , designated Model 403 by the company , was similar to the company 's OS2U Kingfisher , which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships , but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher , and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear . In addition , the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling . Capable of being operated with either the float as a seaplane or with a conventional taildragger undercarriage as a landplane , the XSO2U utilised all-metal construction , with the exception of its control surfaces which were fabric-covered . The wings folded to the rear for storage in a manner similar to that of the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber , . The aircraft was capable of performing dive bombing , and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission , or for anti-submarine warfare . Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns , one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear , while the other was in a flexible position in the observer 's cockpit for rear defense . = = Operational history = = Assigned the serial number 1440 , the XSO2U-1 flew for the first time , as a landplane , in July 1939 ; its first flight as a seaplane took place that December . Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability ; the addition of a large ventral fin , connecting the rear of the float to the tail , helped to cure the problem . The aircraft also suffered from engine problems , however , that were not so easily cured ; the Ranger engine was well known for unreliability , and was particularly prone to overheating problems that were never satisfactoriarly solved . The aircraft 's original XV-770-4 engine was replaced by a XV-770-6 , with a repositioned oil cooler , during flight testing ; despite this , the problems continued . Despite the engine issues , the SO2U-1 was considered overall to be superior to the competing Curtiss XSO3C-1 ; however , Vought 's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U Kingfisher scout and F4U Corsair fighter . As a result , the XSO3C was declared the winner of the contract , and was ordered into production . Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy , and Seamew by the Royal Navy , the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service , and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace . Following the end of the flyoff competition , the XSO2U-1 was used as a general utility aircraft and hack by the Navy , before being supplied to the Ranger Engine Corporation in July 1942 for use in tests of the V-770 engine . These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP-77 lightweight fighter and Edo XOSE floatplane , but the V-770 remained troublesome , and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy . Having no further use for the aircraft , the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy 's rolls on 6 July 1944 , being subsequently scrapped . = = Operators = = United States United States Navy = = Specifications ( XSO2U-1 ) = = Data from OS2U Kingfisher in action General characteristics Crew : 2 ( pilot and observer ) Length : 36 ft 1 in ( 11.00 m ) Wingspan : 38 ft 2 in ( 11.63 m ) Height : 15 ft 11 in ( 4.85 m ) Wing area : 300 sq ft ( 28 m2 ) Empty weight : 4,016 lb ( 1,822 kg ) Max takeoff weight : 5,624 lb ( 2,551 kg ) Fuel capacity : 128 US gallons ( 480 l ; 107 imp gal ) Powerplant : 1 \u00d7 Ranger XV-770 inline engine , 450 hp ( 340 kW ) Propellers : 2-bladed Hamilton Standard constant-speed Performance Maximum speed : 190 mph ( 306 km / h ; 165 kn ) at 9,000 feet ( 2,700 m ) Service ceiling : 22,200 ft ( 6,767 m ) Armament Guns : 2 x M2 Browning machine guns , one fixed forwards-firing , one flexible rear-firing .

                    "text": "Hawker Hunter = The Hawker Hunter is a transonic British jet aircraft developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s . The single-seat Hunter entered service as a manoeuvrable fighter aircraft , and later operated in fighter-bomber and reconnaissance roles in numerous conflicts . Two-seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and Royal Navy until the early 1990s . The Hunter was also widely exported , serving with 21 other air forces . Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service , operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014 . On 7 September 1953 , the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for jet-powered aircraft , achieving 727.63 mph ( 1,171.01 km / h ; 632.29 kn ) . Hunters were also used by two RAF display teams : the \" Black Arrows \" , who on one occasion looped a record-breaking 24 examples in formation , and later the \" Blue Diamonds \" , who flew 16 aircraft . Overall , 1,972 Hunters were produced by Hawker Siddeley and under licence . In British service , the aircraft was replaced by the English Electric Lightning , the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II . = = Development = = = = = Origins = = = At the end of the Second World War , it was apparent that jet propulsion would be the future of fighter development . Many companies were quick to come up with airframe designs for this new means of propulsion . Hawker Aviation 's chief designer , Sydney Camm , proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF , but the demonstrator failed to interest them . Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter . The Sea Hawk had a straight wing and used the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine , both features that rapidly became obsolete . Seeking better performance and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification E.38 / 46 , Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052 , which was essentially a Sea Hawk with a 35-degree swept wing . First flying in 1948 , the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials , but did not warrant further development into a production aircraft . As a private venture , Hawker converted the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes , a revised fuselage , and a single jet exhaust at the rear . First flown on 19 June 1950 , the P.1081 was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , but further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine reheat . The sole prototype was lost in a crash in 1951 . = = = P.1067 = = = In 1946 , the Air Ministry issued Specification F.43 / 46 for a daytime jet-powered interceptor . Camm prepared a new design for a swept-winged fighter powered by the upcoming Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet . The Avon 's major advantage over the Rolls-Royce Nene , used in the earlier Sea Hawk , was the axial compressor , which allowed for a much smaller engine diameter and provided greater thrust ; this single engine gave roughly the same power as the two Rolls-Royce Derwents of the Gloster Meteors that would be replaced by the new fighter . In March 1948 , the Air Ministry issued a revised Specification F.3 / 48 , which demanded a speed of 629 mph ( 1,010 km / h ) at 45,000 ft ( 13,700 m ) and a high rate of climb , while carrying an armament of four 20 mm ( 0.79 in ) or two 30 mm ( 1.18 in ) cannon ( rather than the large-calibre gun demanded by earlier specifications ) . Initially fitted with a single air intake in the nose and a T-tail , the project rapidly evolved into the more familiar Hunter shape . The intakes were moved to the wing roots to make room for weapons and radar in the nose , and a more conventional tail arrangement was devised as a result of stability concerns . The P.1067 first flew from RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951 , powered by a 6,500 lbf ( 28.91 kN ) Avon 103 engine . The second prototype , which was fitted with production avionics , armament and a 7,550 lbf ( 33.58 kN ) Avon 107 turbojet , first flew on 5 May 1952 . As an insurance against Avon development problems , Hawker modified the design to accommodate another axial turbojet , the 8,000 lbf ( 35.59 kN ) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101 . Fitted with a Sapphire , the third prototype flew on 30 November 1952 . The Ministry of Supply ordered the Hunter into production in March 1950 . The Hunter F.1 , fitted with a 7,600 lbf ( 33.80 kN ) Avon 113 turbojet , flew on 16 March 1953 . The first 20 aircraft were , in effect , a pre-production series and featured a number of \" one-off \" modifications such as blown flaps and area ruled fuselage . On 7 September 1953 , the sole Hunter Mk 3 ( the modified first prototype , WB 188 ) flown by Neville Duke broke the world air speed record for jet-powered aircraft , achieving 727.63 mph ( 1,171.01 km / h ) over Littlehampton . The record stood for under three weeks before being broken on 25 September 1953 by an RAF Supermarine Swift flown by Michael Lithgow . = = Design = = = = = Overview = = = The Hunter entered service with the Royal Air Force as an interceptor aircraft . It was the first jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF . From the outset it was clear that the type had exceptional performance , being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber . The Hunter also set numerous aviation records , including absolute speed records . The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time , enabled by features such as its removable gun pack , pressurised fuelling system , and easy handling in flight . The definitive version of the Hunter was the FGA.9 , on which the majority of export versions were based . Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British Government , the Hunter proved far more successful , and had a lengthy service life with various operators , in part due to its low maintenance requirements and operating costs . As the RAF received newer aircraft capable of supersonic speeds to perform the air interceptor role , many Hunters would be modified and re-equipped for undertaking ground-attack and reconnaissance missions instead . Hunters deemed surplus to the RAF 's requirements were also quickly refurbished for continued service abroad . The Hunter would be procured by a considerable number of foreign nations . In addition to former RAF aircraft , roughly half of the nearly 2,000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers . The Hunter would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years . As late as 1996 , hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world . = = = Armament and equipment = = = The single-seat fighter versions of the Hunter were armed with four 30 mm ( 1.18 in ) ADEN cannon , with 150 rounds of ammunition per gun . The cannon and ammunition boxes were contained in a single pack that could be removed from the aircraft for rapid re-arming and maintenance . Unusually , the barrels of the cannon remained in the aircraft while the pack was removed and changed . In the two-seat version , either a single 30 mm ADEN cannon was carried or , in some export versions , two , with a removable ammunition tank . Later versions of the Hunter were fitted with SNEB Pods ; these were 68 mm ( 2.68 in ) rocket projectiles in 18-round Matra pods , providing an effective strike capability against ground targets . The Hunter featured a nose-mounted ranging radar , providing automatic ranging for aiming various armaments . Other equipment included pylon-mounted underwing external fuel tanks , a forward-facing gun camera , and large streamlined pods for collecting expended shell cases beneath the gun pack . It was the placing of those pods which led to the plane getting the humorous nickname \" Huntress \" , because they resemble breasts . Several variants were fitted with tail-mounted brake parachutes . Typically , export Hunters were equipped to be compatible with additional types of missiles , such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile . = = = Layout and structure = = = The Hunter is a conventional swept wing all-metal monoplane . The fuselage is of monocoque construction , with a removable rear section for engine maintenance . The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots and has a single jetpipe in the rear of the fuselage . The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35 \u00b0 and slight anhedral , the tailplanes and fin are also swept . The Hunter 's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models , such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges , underwing fuel tanks to increase range , leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties , and a large ventral air brake . The airframe of the Hunter consists of six interchangeable major sections : the forward fuselage ( housing the cockpit and armament pack ) , center fuselage ( including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes ) , rear fuselage , tail unit assembly , and two individually produced wings . Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack . Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult , as manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures , jigs , and tools . = = = Engine = = = The P.1067 first flew from RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951 , powered by a 6,500 lbf ( 28.91 kN ) Rolls-Royce Avon 103 engine from an English Electric Canberra bomber . The second prototype was fitted with a 7,550 lbf ( 33.58 kN ) Avon 107 turbojet . Hawker 's third prototype was powered by an 8,000 lbf ( 35.59 kN ) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101 . Production Hunters were fitted with either the Avon or the Sapphire engine . Early on in the Hunter 's service the Avon engines proved to have poor surge margins , and worryingly suffered compressor stalls when the cannon were fired , sometimes resulting in flameouts . The practise of \" fuel dipping \" , reducing fuel flow to the engine when the cannon were fired , was a satisfactory solution . Although the Sapphire did not suffer from the flameout problems of the Avon and had better fuel economy , Sapphire-powered Hunters suffered many engine failures . The RAF elected to persevere with the Avon to simplify supply and maintenance , since the Canberra bomber used the same engine . The RAF sought more thrust than was available from the Avon 100 series ; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine . This was an almost wholly new design , equipped with a new compressor to put an end to surge problems , an annular combustion chamber , and an improved fuel control system . The resulting Avon 203 produced 10,000 lbf ( 44.48 kN ) of thrust , and was the engine for the Hunter F.6. = = Operational history = = = = = Royal Air Force = = = The Hunter F.1 entered service with the Royal Air Force in July 1954 . It was the first high-speed jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF . The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor , the Canadair Sabre , and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service . Initially , low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter 's performance , giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour . A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956 , when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions . Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed , killing one pilot . Another difficulty encountered during the aircraft 's introduction was the occurrence of surging and stalling with the Avon engines . The F.2 , which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine , did not suffer from this issue . Further problems occurred ; ejected cannon ammunition links had a tendency to strike and damage the underside of the fuselage , and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification . The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake . This meant , however , that the airbrake could not be used for landings . To address the problem of range , a production Hunter F.1 was fitted with a modified wing that featured bag-type fuel tanks in the leading edge and \" wet \" hardpoints . The resulting Hunter F.4 first flew on 20 October 1954 , and entered service in March 1955 . A distinctive Hunter feature added on the F.4 was the pair of blisters under the cockpit , which collected spent ammunition links to prevent airframe damage . Crews dubbed them \" Sabrinas \" after the contemporary movie star . The Sapphire-powered version of the F.4 was designated the Hunter F.5. The RAF later received Hunters equipped with an improved Avon engine . The Avon 203 produced 10,000 lbf ( 44.48 kN ) of thrust and was fitted to XF833 , which became the first Hunter F.6. Some other revisions on the F.6 included a revised fuel tank layout , the centre fuselage tanks being replaced by new ones in the rear fuselage ; the \" Mod 228 \" wing , which has a distinctive \" dogtooth \" leading edge notch to alleviate the pitch-up problem ; and four \" wet \" hardpoints , finally giving the aircraft a good ferry range . The Hunter F.6 was given the company designation Hawker P.1099. During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Hunters of No. 1 and No. 34 Squadrons based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus flew escort for English Electric Canberra bombers on offensive missions into Egypt . For most of the conflict the Hunters engaged in local air defence due to their lack of range . During the Brunei Revolt in 1962 , the Royal Air Force deployed Hunters and Gloster Javelins over Brunei to provide support for British ground forces ; Hunters launched both dummy and real strafing runs on ground targets to intimidate and pin down rebels . In one event , several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels . Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages in a fierce battle . In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation , Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya . The Hunter F.6 was retired from its day fighter role in the RAF by 1963 , being replaced by the much faster English Electric Lightning interceptor . Many F.6s were then given a new lease of life in the close air support role , converting into the Hunter FGA.9 variant . The FGA.9 saw frontline use from 1960 to 1971 , alongside the closely related Hunter FR.10 tactical reconnaissance variant . The Hunters were also used by two RAF display units ; the \" Black Arrows \" of No. 111 Squadron who set a record by looping and barrel rolling 22 Hunters in formation , and later the \" Blue Diamonds \" of No. 92 Squadron who flew 16 Hunters . In Aden in May 1964 , Hunter FGA.9s and FR.10s of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF were used extensively during the Radfan campaign against insurgents attempting to overthrow the Federation of South Arabia . SAS forces would routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision , and , predominantly using 3-inch high explosive rockets and 30 mm ADEN cannon , the Hunter proved an able ground-attack platform . Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967 . Hunters were flown by No.63 , No. 234 and No. 79 Squadrons acting in training roles for foreign and Commonwealth students . These remained in service until after the Hawk T.1 entered service in the mid-1970s . Two-seat trainer versions of the Hunter , the T.7 and T.8 , remained in use for training and secondary roles by the RAF and Royal Navy until the early 1990s ; when the Blackburn Buccaneer retired from service , the requirement for Hunter trainers was nullified and consequently all were retired . = = = Indian Air Force = = = In 1954 , India arranged to purchase Hunters as a part of a wider arms deal with Britain , ordering 140 Hunter single-seat fighters at the same time that Pakistan announced its purchase of several North American F-86 Sabre jet fighters . The Indian Air Force ( IAF ) was the first to operate the Hunter T.66 trainers , placing an initial order in 1957 . The more powerful engine was considered beneficial in a hot environment , allowing for greater takeoff weights . During the 1960s , Pakistan investigated the possibility of buying as many as 40 English Electric Lightnings , but Britain was unenthusiastic about the potential sales opportunity because of the damage it would do to its relations with India , which at the time was still awaiting the delivery of large numbers of ex-RAF Hunters . By the outbreak of the Sino-Indian War in 1962 , India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia , and the Hunter was the nation 's primary and most capable interceptor . During the conflict , the Hunter demonstrated its superiority over China 's Russian-sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air . India 's aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il-4 bombers from attacking targets within India . In 1962 , India had selected to procure its first supersonic-capable fighter , the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 ; large numbers of Russian-built fighters had increasingly supplemented the aging Hunters in the interceptor role by 1970 . The Hunter was to play a major role during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 ; along with the Gnat the Hunter was India 's primary air defence fighter , and regularly engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters . The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month . Both sides claimed victory in the air war , Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19 , while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own . Despite the intense fighting , the conflict was effectively a stalemate . IAF Hunters performed extensive operations during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 ; India had six combat-ready squadrons of Hunters at the start of the conflict . Pakistani infantry and armoured forces attacked the Indian outpost of Longewala in an event now known as the Battle of Longewala . Six IAF Hunters stationed at Jaisalmer Air Force Base were able to halt the Pakistani advance at Longewala by conducting non-stop bombing raids . The aircraft attacked Pakistani tanks , armoured personnel carriers and gun positions and contributed to the increasingly chaotic battlefield conditions , which ultimately led to the retreat of Pakistan 's ground forces . Hunters were also used for many ground-attack missions and raids inside Pakistan 's borders , such as the high-profile bombing of the Attock Oil refinery to limit Pakistani fuel supplies . In the aftermath of the conflict , Pakistan claimed to have shot down a total of 32 of India 's Hunters . Due to unfavourable currency conditions and conflicting pressures on the military budget , several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war ; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped , thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers . After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter , including the Dassault Mirage F1 , the Saab 37 Viggen , and several Soviet models , the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars , a large portion of which were to be assembled domestically , in October 1978 . In 1996 , the last of the IAF 's Hunters were phased out of service , the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI . = = = Swedish Air Force = = = In the early 1950s , the Swedish Air Force saw the need for an interceptor that could reach enemy bombers at a higher altitude than the J 29 Tunnan that formed the backbone of the fighter force . A contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s ( equivalent to the Mk 4 ) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954 and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955 . The model was designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that defended Stockholm . The J 34 was armed with four 30 mm ( 1.18 in ) cannon and two Sidewinders . The Swedish Air Force 's aerobatic team Acro Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s . The J 34s were gradually replaced by supersonic J 35 Draken and reassigned to less prominent air wings , F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in \u00c4ngelholm , during the 1960s . A project to improve the performance of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958 . While this significantly increased the engine 's thrust , there was little improvement in overall performance , thus the project was shelved . The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969 . = = = Swiss Air Force = = = In 1957 , the Swiss Air Force performed an extensive evaluation of several aircraft for a prospective purchase ; competitors included the North American F-86 Sabre , the Folland Gnat , and the Hawker Hunter ; a pair of Hunters were loaned to the Swiss for further trials and testing . In January 1958 , the government of Switzerland chose to terminate their independent fighter aircraft project , the in-development FFA P-16 , instead choosing to order 100 Hunters to replace their existing fleet of de Havilland Vampire fighters. further development of the indigenous P-16 was discontinued . This initial order for 100 single-seat Hunters consisted of 12 refurbished RAF F.6s , and 88 new-built F.58s. Swiss Hunters were operated as interceptors , with a secondary ground-attack role ; from 1963 onwards , the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles . In the ground-attack role , the Swiss Air Force maintained an arsenal of conventional iron bombs , a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters . In the interceptor role , the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile ( SAM ) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom , based on the Bristol Bloodhound . A portion of the Hunter fleet was permanently placed in reserve as \" sleeper squadrons \" , housed in remote mountain-side hangars . It was planned that in a large-scale conflict , these aircraft would fly from adjacent highways , using them as improvised runways . The Patrouille Suisse flight demonstration team were prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades . Squadron aircraft were fitted with smoke generators on the engine exhausts and , later on , were painted in a distinctive red-and-white livery . The group officially formed on 22 August 1964 , and used the Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994 , the team continued to perform flight display using newer aircraft . The Hunter fleet endured several attempts to procure successor aircraft to the type ; in the case of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due to excessive cost overruns and poor project management rather than the attributes of the Hunter itself . A second attempt to replace the Hunter resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A-7 Corsair II . Although the A-7 was eventually chosen as the winner , it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters ( 22 F.58As and eight T.68 trainers ) were purchased in 1974 instead . By 1975 , plans were laid to replace the Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft , the Northrop F-5E Tiger II . The Hunter remained in a key role within the Swiss Air Force ; like the RAF 's Hunter fleet , the type transitioned to become the country 's primary ground attack platform , replacing the Venom . While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft , being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80 mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF , to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles , the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade , adding chaff / flare dispensers , BL755 cluster bombs and the ability to carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles . In the 1990s , the discovery of wing cracking lead to the quick scrapping of all Hunter F.58As. The end of the Cold War also allowed Switzerland to retire its Hunters earlier than expected , even before taking delivery of the McDonnell Douglas F / A-18 Hornets that had been ordered as replacements for the type ; the Hunter was completely withdrawn from Swiss service in 1994 . Author Fiona Lombardi stated of the retirement of the Hunter , the Swiss Air Force \" definitively lost the capability to carry out air-to-ground operations \" . = = = Republic of Singapore Air Force = = = Singapore was an enthusiastic operator of the Hunter , first ordering the aircraft in 1968 during a massive expansion of the city-state 's armed forces ; deliveries began in 1971 and were completed by 1973 . At the time , considerable international controversy was generated as Britain ( and , as was later revealed , the U.S. ) had refused to sell Hunters to neighbouring Malaysia , sparking fears of a regional arms race and accusations of favouritism . The Republic of Singapore Air Force ( RSAF ) eventually received 46 refurbished Hunters to equip two squadrons . In the late 1970s , the Singaporean Hunter fleet was upgraded and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore ( LASS ) with an additional hardpoint under the forward fuselage and another two inboard pylons ( wired only for AIM-9 Sidewinders ) before the main gears , bringing to a total of seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery . As a result of these upgrades , they were redesignated as FGA.74S , FR.74S and T.75S. The RSAF Black Knights , Singapore Air Force 's aerobatic team , flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989 . By 1991 , Singapore 's fleet of combat aircraft included the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon , the Northrop F-5 Tiger II , as well as the locally modernised and upgraded ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk ; the Hunters were active but obsolete in comparison . The type was finally retired and phased out of service in 1992 , with the 21 surviving airframes being sold off to an Australian warbird broker , Pacific Hunter Aviation Pty , in 1995 . = = = Lebanese Air Force = = = The Lebanese Air Force operated Hawker Hunters from 1958 to 2014 . A Lebanese Hunter shot down an Israeli jet over Kfirmishki in the early 1960s ; its pilot was captured by the Lebanese Armed Forces . One Hunter was shot down on the first day of the Six-Day War by the Israeli Air Force . They were used infrequently during the Lebanese Civil War , and eventually fell out of usage and went into storage during the 1980s . In August 2007 , the Lebanese Armed Forces planned to put its Hunters back into service following the 2007 Lebanon conflict , to deal with Fatah al-Islam militants in the Nahr el-Bared camp north of Tripoli . The programme was delayed by lack of spare parts for the aircraft , such as cartridges for the Martin-Baker ejection seats . On 12 November 2008 , 50 years after its original introduction , the Lebanese Air Force returned four of its eight Hunters to service with 2nd Squadron , based at Rayak AB : one two-seater and three single-seaters \u2032 . Military exercises were conducted with Hunters , such as those that took place on 12 July 2010 . The Hunters were retired from service during 2014 . = = = Others = = = = = = = Africa = = = = During the 1950s , the Royal Rhodesian Air Force was an important export customer of Britain , purchasing not only Hunters but De Havilland Vampires and Canberra bombers as well . Rhodesia later deployed its Hunter FGA.9s extensively against ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas during the Rhodesian Bush War in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s , occasionally engaging in cross-border raids over Zambia and Mozambique . The Zimbabwean Air Force Hunters were flown to support Laurent Kabila 's loyalists during the Second Congo War , and were reported to be involved in the Mozambican Civil War . In Somalia , the Siad Barre regime 's fleet of ageing Hunters , often piloted by former Rhodesian servicemen , carried out several bombing missions against rebel units in the late 1980s . = = = = Belgium and the Netherlands = = = = The Belgian Air Force received 112 Hunter F.4s between 1956 and 1957 to replace the Gloster Meteor F.8. The aircraft were built under licence in both Belgium and the Netherlands in a joint programme , some using U.S. offshore funding . SABCA and Avions Fairey built 64 aircraft in Belgium and a further 48 were built in the Netherlands by Fokker . The Hunters were used by Nos. 1 , 3 and 9 Wings but did not serve for long ; the aircraft with 1 Wing were replaced in 1958 by the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck , and most were scrapped afterwards . The Belgian and Dutch governments subsequently ordered the improved Hunter F.6 , with Nos. 1 , 7 and 9 Wings of the Belgian Air Force receiving 112 Fokker-built aircraft between 1957 and 1958 . Although built in the Netherlands , 29 aircraft had been assembled from kits in Belgium by SABCA and 59 by Avions Fairey , and were operated by 7 and 9 Wings . No. 9 Wing was disbanded in 1960 , and by 1963 the Hunter squadrons in 7 Wing had also been disbanded . A large number of the surviving Hunters were sold to Hawker Aircraft and re-built for re-export to India and Iraq , with others to Chile , Kuwait and Lebanon . = = = = Middle East = = = = Between 1964 and 1975 , both Britain and France delivered significant quantities of arms , including Hunters , to Iraq . The Hunters were far more effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated by Iraq . In 1967 , Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six-Day War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations . During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria . While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3 , Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam , on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force , shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ . Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force , but most of the Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground on the first day of the Six-Day War . Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war 's aftermath . These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis . = = = = South America = = = = During the 1960s and 1970s , Chile completed the acquisition of Hunters from Britain for service in the Chilean Air Force . In June 1973 , the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on Guamblin Island , accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil . After the rescue of the crew , the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters in an effort to burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination . During the 1973 Chilean coup d '\u00e9tat , some of the Hunters were used by military officers as part of the effort to successfully overthrow the socialist president of Chile , Salvador Allende , on 11 September 1973 . On 10 September 1973 , coup leaders ordered the Hunters to relocate to Talcahuano in preparation . The following morning , the aircraft were used to conduct bombing missions against the presidential palace , Allende 's house in Santiago , and several radio stations loyal to the government . The UK had signed contracts prior to the Chilean coup d '\u00e9tat for delivery of a further seven Hunters , as well as performing engine overhauls and the delivery of other equipment . The government under Prime Minister James Callaghan delayed the delivery of the aircraft , along with vessels and submarines also on order ; the trade unions took action to block delivery of refurbished Hunter engines at the East Kilbride plant until October 1978 . The action was led by Rolls Royce workers , Bob Fulton , Robert Sommerville and John Keenan , who hid the engines in the factory . The Government of Chile bestowed on 16 April 2015 , its highest civilian medal the Order Bernardo O 'Higgins Medal on the three workers for their action of solidarity . In 1982 , after the Falklands War , a number of Hunters were air freighted to Chile as part of the arrangements for providing support for UK operations in the South Atlantic . The purchase of Hunters by Chile may have been a factor in the decision by the Peruvian Air Force to acquire Hunters of their own . Britain was keen to sell to Peru as the decision to sell Hunters to Chile became a controversial political issue for the British government following the Chilean coup ; the sale also upheld Britain 's concept of regional \" balancing \" . = = Variants = = = = Operators = = = = = Military operators = = = Abu Dhabi Belgium Chile Denmark Iraq India Jordan Kenya Kuwait Lebanon Netherlands Oman Peru Qatar Rhodesia Saudi Arabia Singapore Somalia Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom Zimbabwe = = = Civil = = = A number of civil organisations operate or have operated Hunters for use as aerial targets and for threat simulation under contract with the military .

                    "text": "Ilyushin Il-40 = The Ilyushin Il-40 ( NATO reporting name : Brawny ) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft . The first prototype flew in 1953 and was very successful except when it fired its guns , as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup . Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes all the way to the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage , just behind the nose wheel . The aircraft , now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front , was ordered into production in 1955 . Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield . = = Development = = Sergey Ilyushin had begun design studies during 1950 \u2013 51 for a jet-engined ground-attack aircraft possessing better performance characteristics than was possible with piston-engined aircraft . By the end of 1951 the Ilyushin design bureau had prepared a technical proposal for a two-seat armored aircraft using two Mikulin AM-5 axial-flow turbojets rated at 2,150 kgf ( 4,740 lbf ) at maximum power ( without afterburner ) and 2,700 kgf ( 5,952 lbf ) with afterburner . In January 1952 Ilyushin sent this proposal to the government , which was quickly accepted , and he was directed to design and build one prototype . The Il-40 had wings set low on the fuselage , swept back at an angle of 35 \u00b0 , and a tricycle undercarriage . The two AM-5 engines were in pods adjacent to the fuselage . As was traditional for Ilyushin ground-attack aircraft the core of Il-40 's structure was a load-bearing armored shell that protected both crew positions , six fuel tanks and part of the radio and electrical equipment . The thickness of the shell ranged from 3 to 8 mm ( 0.12 to 0.31 in ) in thickness . The armored bulkhead protecting the pilot from the front was 10 mm ( 0.39 in ) thick . The cockpit glazing was also bulletproof and the pilot was given an 8 mm ( 0.31 in ) armored headrest to protect him against shells fired from above and behind . The gunner was protected by armor 4 \u2013 10 mm ( 0.16 \u2013 0.39 in ) thick . The total weight of the armored shell and the bulletproof glass was 1,918 kg ( 4,228 lb ) . Ejection seats were provided for both crewmembers . Three perforated airbrakes were fitted on the rear fuselage , one on each side and one underneath , to enhance the aircraft 's maneuverability during a dive . The initial armament was six 23 mm ( 0.91 in ) Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 autocannons mounted in the nose , three on each side , each with 150 rounds , with their muzzles protruding into the slipstream . One NR-23 was mounted in a remotely controlled Il-K10 tail barbette with 200 rounds . It had a maximum elevation of 55 \u00b0 , a maximum depression of 40 \u00b0 and could traverse 60 \u00b0 to either side . The Il-K10 could traverse at a rate of 42 \u00b0 per second and elevate at a rate of 38 \u00b0 per second . Four small bomb bays were fitted in the wings with a maximum capacity of 100 kg ( 220 lb ) each . Alternatively four bomb racks could be fitted under the wings that could carry bombs up to 500 kg ( 1,100 lb ) , 82 mm ( 3.2 in ) TRS-82 or 132 mm ( 5.2 in ) TRS-132 rockets , or drop tanks with a total capacity of 1,100 litres ( 290 US gal ) . The normal bomb load was 400 kg ( 880 lb ) , but 1,000 kg ( 2,200 lb ) could be carried at overload . Under overloaded conditions a maximum of twelve TRS-82 or eight TRS-132 rockets could be carried . Two cameras were fitted in the rear fuselage for day and night damage-assessment photos . First flown on 7 March 1953 , flight tests revealed no serious shortcomings in the air . The operational CG was too far aft , but this was only a minor problem when landing , taking off and taxiing , especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase . The biggest problem proved to be the guns and their effect on the engines . During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out . The pilot was able to restart the engines and made it back safely , but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems . Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference ; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds . A decision was made to replace the six NR-23 guns in the nose with four AM-23 cannon with 225 rounds per gun that had a rate of fire 50 % greater than that of the NR-23 and to totally revise the gun installation . The guns were moved to the very tip of the nose in a separate compartment made of heat-resistant steel and provided with a special blast deflector chamber to deflect the blast gasses away from the engine inlets . Two doors were provided at the bottom of the chamber to ventilate the chamber while firing . One problem occurred almost immediately during testing when the blast gases accumulated in the section where spent cartridges and links were saved and sometimes ignited . Occasionally this was strong enough to actually deform the chamber . The spent shell case section was thoroughly ventilated and muzzle brakes were introduced to successfully cure the problem . Resolving the problem with the guns had prevented the aircraft from undergoing its State acceptance trials in July 1953 as stipulated and a special commission was appointed to conduct the trials on 31 December 1953 . After the manufacturer 's trials were successfully concluded in January 1954 the aircraft was turned over and the State acceptance trials lasted from 21 January \u2014 15 March 1954 . The tests were generally successful with the Il-40 proving to be easy to fly , maneuverable enough to be a handful for the MiG-15bis and MiG-17 fighters opposing it and considerably superior to the piston-engined Ilyushin Il-10M ground-attack aircraft then in service . However fight tests did reveal blast gas ingestion when firing in a sideslip by the engine on the side opposite the sideslip . Several solutions were evaluated to cure the problem , but Ilyushin pushed for the more radical solution of extending the air intakes for the engines all the way to the nose of the aircraft and moving the guns to the bottom of the nose , behind the air intakes . The change in position of the guns and the extension of the air intakes , which looked \" uncannily like a double-barreled shotgun , \" allowed the nose wheel to be moved forward to lengthen the wheelbase . The guns were mounted behind the nose wheel well and a special shield was added to protect the gun barrels from debris thrown up by the nose wheel ; it was mechanically linked to the nose wheel and extended when it did . Other changes included the replacement of the original AM-5F engines by the Tumansky RD-9V , an improved version of the AM-5F , the normal bomb load was increased to 1,000 kg and 1,400 kg ( 3,100 lb ) in overloaded condition , and a rear-view mirror was added to allow the pilot to better observe the rear upper hemisphere . = = Production = = Ilyushin began construction of another prototype to evaluate this solution and this was endorsed on 16 October 1954 when the Council of Ministers ordered production to begin at Factory ( Zavod ) No. 168 at Rostov-on-Don of the improved version , designated as the Il-40P . The Il-40P prototype first flew on 14 February 1955 and began State acceptance trials on 12 October 1955 . The changes had resolved all the problems suffered by the earlier design and an order for a first batch of forty production machines was placed . Five of these had been completed by the spring of 1956 and were undergoing pre-flight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped . A week later , the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified . No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army , but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield . Before the program was canceled two variants had been studied by Ilyushin . The first was an artillery-spotting version known as the Il-40K . This model added a third crewman in a redesigned forward fuselage . The air intakes were reverted to their original position as the guns had been placed in the small wing bomb bays and there wasn 't any danger of the engines ingesting blast gasses from the guns . The spotter-navigator was given an extensively glazed position at the tip of the nose that was well-protected with armor and bulletproof glass . The first fuselage was nearing completion when the order came to cancel the entire program . The second variant was a torpedo-carrying version called the Il-40T which was based on the fuselage of the Il-40K , but the navigator-bombardier 's position had optically flat glass panels to facilitate aiming . Not much effort was devoted to this model and it was canceled at an early stage . = = Variants = = Il-40 \u2013 First prototype Il-40P \u2013 Second prototype and five production aircraft .

                    "text": "Black Arrow = Black Arrow , officially capitalised BLACK ARROW , was a British satellite carrier rocket . Developed during the 1960s , it was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971 . Its final flight was the first and only successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom , and placed the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit . Black Arrow originated from studies by the Royal Aircraft Establishment for carrier rockets based on the Black Knight rocket , with the project being authorised in 1964 . It was initially developed by Saunders-Roe , and later Westland Aircraft as the result of a merger . Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket , fuelled by RP-1 paraffin ( kerosene ) and high test peroxide , a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide . It was retired after only four launches in favour of using American Scout rockets , which the Ministry of Defence calculated to be cheaper than maintaining the Black Arrow programme . = = Development = = Black Arrow originated from a Royal Aircraft Establishment proposal for a rocket capable of placing a 317-pound ( 144 kg ) payload into low Earth orbit , in order to test systems designed for larger spacecraft . In the autumn of 1964 , the programme was authorised by Conservative Aviation Minister Julian Amery . Then , following a general election in October , the incoming Labour government put the project on hold to reduce expenditure . Following another election , the government approved the continuation of the programme with several modifications , including the reduction of the test programme from five to three launches . The first launch was set for 1968 . Most of the technology and systems used on Black Arrow had already been developed or flight-proven on the Black Knight rocket , or the Blue Steel missile . Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible in order to reduce costs , and simplify the development process . Many senior staff of the Black Knight programme transferred directly to Black Arrow , including the Chief Missile Scientist , Roy Dommett , the Chief Design Engineer , Ray Wheeler and the Deputy Chief Engineer , John Underwood . Initial development was conducted by Saunders-Roe , which merged into Westland Aircraft in 1964 . Westland was subsequently the prime contractor for the Black Arrow , and assembled the first and second stages at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight . Bristol Siddeley produced the first and second stage engines at a factory in Ansty , Warwickshire . The engines were test fired at the factory before being shipped to the Isle of Wight , where they were integrated into the rocket and the first stage engines were fired again at High Down . Bristol Aerojet produced the third stage in Somerset , while the Explosives Research and Development Establishment produced its solid propellant in Waltham Abbey , Essex . The Rocket Propulsion Establishment , based in Westcott , Buckinghamshire , was responsible for the design and integration of the stage . The name Black Arrow came from the Ministry of Supply policy of assigning designations consisting of a colour and a noun , unofficially known as Rainbow Codes , to research programmes conducted by the Armed Forces . = = Vehicle = = The first and second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 paraffin ( kerosene ) , burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser . Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7 , a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems . The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks , following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control . This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States , whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks , making it easier for the lower tank to be filled first . Thrust vectoring was used to provide attitude control on the first two stages . The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis . Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two , and when all four pairs were used together , they provided roll , pitch and yaw control . The second stage had two combustion chambers , which could gimbal along two axes , providing the same level of control . During a coast phase after second stage cut-off , the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system . The third stage did not have an attitude control system , and was instead spin-stabilised . The first stage was powered by a single Gamma 8 engine , which burned for 127 seconds . The Gamma 8 was an eight-chamber engine , derived from the Gamma 301 engine used on the Black Knight . It was 6.9 metres ( 23 ft ) long , and had a diameter of 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) , the same diameter as the French Coralie . Coralie was used as the second stage of the Europa rocket , and the decision to give Black Arrow the same diameter as Coralie was taken in order to make it compatible with Blue Streak , which was used as the first stage of Europa . This would have allowed Black Arrow 's payload capacity to have been increased , and would also have allowed Britain to use the first stage of Black Arrow as a backup to the Coralie . For this reason , all dimensions in the original specification were given in imperial units except the first stage diameter , which was given in metres . The first and second stages were connected by an interstage structure containing four Siskin IB separation and ullage motors , which separated and ignited seven seconds after the first stage had cut off . The interstage separated from the second stage six seconds later . The second stage , which was 2.9 metres ( 9 ft 6 in ) long and measured 1.37 metres ( 4 ft 6 in ) in diameter , was powered by a two-chamber Gamma 2 engine which ignited shortly after the separation motors , and continued to burn for 123 seconds . Three minutes after launch , during the second stage burn , the payload fairing separated . About 257 seconds into the flight , the second stage cut off , and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee . Immediately after cut-off , the second stage attitude control system was pressurised . During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained by means of the attitude control system . Towards the end of the coast period , the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3 hertz ( 180 rpm ) by means of six Imp rockets . Five seconds later , the third stage separated , and following ten more seconds of coasting , it ignited . The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor , which burned for 55 seconds . Just over a minute after the third stage had burned out , the payload was released , and gas generators were used to push the spacecraft and spent upper stage apart . The delay between burnout and separation was intended to reduce the risk of recontact between the upper stage and payload due to residual thrust . Despite this , following spacecraft separation on the R3 launch , the upper stage collided with the Prospero satellite , damaging one of the spacecraft 's communications antennae ; however the spacecraft was still able to successfully complete its mission . On the R3 launch , the ascent took 710 seconds ( 11.8 min ) from liftoff to spacecraft separation . Although none were ever built , several derivatives of Black Arrow were also proposed , as ways of increasing its payload capacity . One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme to the first stage as booster rockets . Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile , while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch . = = Launches = = Four Black Arrows were launched between 1969 and 1971 . The first two launches were demonstration flights , with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload . On the first flight an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth . Before it cleared the launch pad , the rocket was rolling erratically , and about a minute later it began to disintegrate . After the first stage engine failed , and the rocket began to fall back to earth , it was destroyed by range safety . The second launch was successful . The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow , and Britain 's first attempt to launch a satellite . The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system , which caused it to cut out early . The third stage fired , but the rocket did not reach orbit , and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria . The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite , making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit by means of an indigenously developed carrier rocket . The satellite , also known as X-3 , was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare 's The Tempest . The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play , in which Prospero , a sorcerer , gives up his powers . Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme , the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night 's Dream . All four launches were conducted from Launch Area 5B at the Woomera Prohibited Area in Australia , which had previously been used as a test site for the Black Knight rocket . During the development programme , launch sites in Barbados , Uist and Norfolk were also considered . The launch sites at Uist and Norfolk were rejected because the former was too remote , while there was a risk that a rocket launched from the latter might drop spent stages on an oil rig in the North Sea . = = Cancellation = = The Minister of State for Trade and Industry , Frederick Corfield , announced the cancellation of the Black Arrow project in the House of Commons on 29 July 1971 . As the R3 rocket had already been shipped to the launch site , the second stage having arrived three days earlier , permission was given for it to be launched . The programme was cancelled on economic grounds , as the Ministry of Defence decided that it would be cheaper to use the American Scout rocket , which had a similar payload capacity , for future launches . Prior to the cancellation of Black Arrow , NASA had offered to launch British payloads for free ; however , this offer was withdrawn following the decision to cancel Black Arrow . The final Black Arrow to be completed was R4 , which did not fly , and is preserved in the Science Museum , London , along with the flight spare for the Prospero satellite . A replica of the Black Arrow rocket stands in the Rocket Park at Woomera . In addition , the remains of the first stage of Black Arrow R3 were recovered from the Anna Creek cattle station and are displayed in the William Creek Memorial Park . The launch facilities at Woomera were demolished within a year of the final flight , and half of the engineers who had worked on the programme were laid off . The X-4 satellite , which had been manifested for launch by Black Arrow R4 , was eventually launched on 9 March 1974 , by an American Scout D-1 rocket flying from Space Launch Complex 5 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California . As of 2014 , the United Kingdom is the only country to have successfully developed and then abandoned a satellite launch capability . All other countries that have developed such a capability have retained it either through their own space programme or , in the case of France , through its involvement in the Ariane programme .",

To facilitate loading and unloading the glider 's nose and tail sections were hinged to swing sideways . The Il-32 required a four-engined aircraft to tow it safely ; it was canceled when it became clear that no such tug was going to be available after the Tupolev Tu-75 and Ilyushin Il-18 programs were both canceled because of shortages of their intended Shvetsov ASh-73 engines . = = Development = = After the end of World War II the Soviets devoted a considerable amount of effort to developing heavy transport gliders to deliver troops during an airborne assault . As part of this effort the Council of Ministers ordered the Ilyushin design bureau on 20 September 1947 to begin work on a glider capable of carrying 7,000 kg ( 15,000 lb ) of cargo , including 60 troops or a 122 mm ( 4.8 in ) cannon with its prime mover , ammunition and crew . Its intended tug was the Tupolev Tu-75 , a four-engined transport derived from the Tupolev Tu-4 . The Il-32 was an aluminum-bodied , high-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage whose fuselage was square in cross-section to fit as much cargo as possible . The two-spar wings had a moderate aspect ratio . It was regarded as expendable and was built very simply to facilitate large-scale manufacture . The nose and tail sections swung up to 95 \u00b0 to starboard to facilitate loading . The Il-32 made its first flight on 20 August 1948 , towed by a twin-engined Ilyushin Il-12 , but the Il-12 wasn 't powerful enough to tow a fully loaded glider and the four-engined Il-18 airliner prototype was adapted to tow it from 20 September . During these flight tests it reached a cruising speed of 323 km / h ( 201 mph ) at an altitude of 3,000 metres ( 9,800 ft ) and a weight of 16,000 kg ( 35,000 lb ) . The flight tests were satisfactory and preparations were made to begin series production , but the lack of suitable tugs was a problem . None of the Soviet four-engined aircraft that could be used were either in production or available . Both the Tupolev Tu-70 and Il-18 airliners had been canceled , as had the Tu-75 transport , and the Tu-4 was dedicated to the strategic bombing mission . Experiments were made with a pair of Il-12s towing the Il-32 , but this was both difficult and risky for all involved .

Only two aircraft were built , one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic research and the other served as an armament testbed . Both prototypes were destroyed in accidents during testing . The XF-104 was the forerunner of over 2,500 Lockheed F-104 Starfighters . During the Korean War , USAF fighter pilots were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots . Lockheed engineers , led by Kelly Johnson , designed and submitted a novel design to the Air Force . The design was notable for its sleekness , particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage , as well as a novel pilot ejection system . The XF-104 's maiden flight came in February 1954 . The flight test program encountered problems , some of which were resolved ; however , the XF-104 performance proved better than estimates . Both prototypes were lost through accidents . Nevertheless , the USAF ordered 17 service-test F-104s . Internationally , the production F-104 Starfighters proved popular , serving as front-line fighters with a number of countries . = = Development = = Clarence L. \" Kelly \" Johnson , chief engineer at Lockheed 's Skunk Works , visited Korea in December 1951 and talked to fighter pilots about what sort of aircraft they wanted . At the time , U.S. Air Force pilots were confronting the MiG-15 \" Fagot \" in their North American F-86 Sabres , and many of the pilots felt that the MiGs were superior to the larger and more complex American design . The pilots requested a small and simple aircraft with excellent performance . One pilot in particular , Colonel Gabby Gabreski was quoted as saying ; \" I 'd rather sight with a piece of chewing gum stuck on the windscreen \" and told Johnson that radar \" was a waste of time \" . On his return to the U.S. , Johnson immediately started the design of just such an aircraft realising that an official requirement would soon be published . In March 1952 , his team was assembled , and they sketched several different aircraft proposals , ranging from small designs at 8,000 lb ( 3.6 t ) , to fairly large ones at 50,000 lb ( 23 t ) . The L-246 as the design became known remained essentially identical to the \" Model L-083 Starfighter \" as eventually delivered . The design was presented to the Air Force in November 1952 , who were interested enough to create a new proposal , inviting several companies to participate . Three additional designs were received : the Republic AP-55 , an improved version of its prototype XF-91 Thunderceptor ; the North American NA-212 , which would eventually evolve into the F-107 ; and the Northrop N-102 Fang , a new General Electric J79-powered design . Although all were interesting , Lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a development contract in March 1953 . Test data from the earlier Lockheed X-7 unmanned ramjet / rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7 's wing and tail . Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104 . Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs ; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute . The wooden mock-up was ready for inspection at the end of April , and work started on two prototypes late in May . The J79 engine was not yet ready , so both prototypes were instead designed to use the Wright J65 , a licensed built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire . Construction of the first prototype XF-104 ( US serial number 53-7786 , Buzz number FG-786 ) began in summer 1953 at Lockheed 's Burbank , California factory . This aircraft was powered by a non-afterburning Buick-built Wright J65-B-3 turbojet . The first prototype was completed by early 1954 , and started flying in March . The total time from award of the contract to first flight was only one year , a very short time even then , and unheard of today , when 10 \u2013 15 years is more typical . Construction of the second prototype ( s / n 53-7787 ) proceeded at a slower pace . = = Design = = In order to achieve the desired performance , Lockheed chose a minimalist approach : a design that would achieve high performance by wrapping the lightest , most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine . The emphasis was on minimizing drag and mass . The XF-104 had a radical wing design . Most supersonic jets use a swept or delta wing . This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance , lift , and internal space for fuel and equipment . However the most efficient shape for high-speed , supersonic flight had been found to be a small , straight , mid-mounted , trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading . The wing was extremely thin , with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4 % . The leading edges of the wing were so thin ( 0.016 in / 0.41 mm ) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews , and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations . The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage . The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch ( 25 mm ) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument . The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed . The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft . After extensive wind tunnel testing , the stabilator was mounted at the top of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis . Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective , it could act as a wing on rudder application ( a phenomenon known as \" Dutch roll \" ) . To offset this effect , the wings were angled downward to give 10 \u00b0 anhedral . The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at the bottom of the fin . The fuselage of the XF-104 had a high fineness ratio , i.e. , tapering sharply towards the nose , and a small frontal area of 25 sq ft ( 2.3 m2 ) . The fuselage was tightly packed , containing the cockpit , avionics , cannon , all internal fuel , landing gear , and engine . The air intakes , designed by Ben Rich , were of fixed geometry without inlet cones , since the J65-powered aircraft was incapable of Mach 2 performance . They were similar to those of the F-94 Starfire , being mounted slightly away from the fuselage , with an inner splitter plate for the boundary layer bleed air . The combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack , at which point induced drag became very high . The XF-104 featured an unusual downward-ejecting Stanley B seat . It was feared that contemporary ejection seat designs would not have enough explosive power to clear the high \" T \" tail assembly . In the event of the seat not firing , it was possible to manually release the lower fuselage hatch and then exit the aircraft via gravity . The F-104 series aircraft would later convert to upward-ejecting seats but the fuselage hatch was retained as a useful maintenance feature . = = Operational history = = = = = Testing and evaluation = = = The first XF-104 ( Lockheed 083-1001 , s / n 53-7786 ) was transported to Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy during the night of 24 \u2013 25 February , where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing . On 28 February 1954 , the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a high-speed taxi , but its first official flight took place on 4 March . During that flight , the landing gear did not retract , and LeVier landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes . Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system . Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March , when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally . The second prototype ( Lockheed 083-1002 , s / n 53-7787 ) , fitted with the afterburning J65 from the start , first flew on 5 October . Since it was to be the armament test bed , it was fitted with the 20 mm ( .79 in ) M61 Vulcan cannon and was equipped with an AN / ASG-14T-1 fire control system . XF-104 # 2 achieved a top speed of Mach 1.79 at 60,000 feet ( 18,000 m ) on 25 March 1955 , piloted by Lockheed test pilot J. Ray Goudey . This was the highest speed achieved by the XF-104 . XF-104 # 1 was subsonic in level flight when powered by the non-afterburning J65 , but Mach 1 could be easily exceeded during a slight descent . In July 1954 , the J65-B-3 was replaced by the afterburning J65-W-7 turbojet . With this engine installed , the performance of the XF-104 was greatly improved . Maximum level speed was Mach 1.49 at 41,000 ft ( 12,000 m ) , and an altitude of 55,000 ft ( 17,000 m ) could be attained in a zoom climb , while Mach 1.6 could be attained in a dive . The first XF-104 was accepted by the USAF in November 1955 . Initial aerial firing tests with the Vulcan cannon on the second aircraft were successful , but on 17 December , there was an explosion during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls . Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake . An investigation later showed that one of the 20 mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech , blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell . Jet fuel had run into the gun bay , and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake . The engine immediately flooded with fuel , causing the compressor stalls . = = = Crashes = = = XF-104 53-7786 was lost in a crash on 11 July 1957 when it developed an uncontrollable tail flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests . The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe , and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject . Vertical fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds of no more than Mach 0.95 at the time of the accident . Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum , arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties . XF-104 53-7787 was lost on 14 April 1955 after accumulating over 1,000 flying hours when test pilot Herman Salmon was forced to eject during gun firing trials at 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) . The gun malfunctioned during a test firing , and severe vibrations began to build up which knocked loose the ejection hatch below the cockpit . Cabin pressure was lost with Salmon 's pressure suit inflating and covering his face so that he could not see . Recalling LeVier 's harrowing experience with the exploding cannon shell the previous December , Salmon believed that the same thing had happened to him and that he had no option but to eject . He later found out that he could have saved 53-7787 by simply bringing it down to a lower altitude and waiting for his pressure suit to deflate . With the loss of the armament testbed , Lockheed engineers were forced to find an alternative , and armament trials were continued on a modified F-94C Starfire . The two XF-104s amassed an approximate total of 250 flight hours . = = = Testing conclusions = = = Flight testing proved that performance estimates were accurate and that even when fitted with the low powered J65 engine , the XF-104 flew faster than the other Century Series fighters being developed at the time . The XF-104 's ceiling at 60,000 ft ( 18,000 m ) was 7,000 ft ( 2,100 m ) higher than predicted , and it exceeded estimated speed and drag figures by two to three percent . It was noted however that the low thrust of the J65 engine did not enable the full performance potential of the type to be realized . A number of minor problems surfaced , but were readily fixed . The yaw damper of the XF-104 was found to be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center , these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system . The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds ( remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104 ) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes . During a later interview , Kelly Johnson was asked about his opinion on the aircraft , \" Did it come up to my designs ? In terms of performance , yes . In terms of engine , we went through a great many engine problems , not with the J65s but with the J79s . \" For his part in designing the F-104 airframe , Johnson was jointly awarded the Collier Trophy in 1958 , sharing the honor with General Electric ( engine ) and the U.S. Air Force ( Flight Records ) . = = = F-104 production = = = Official approval of the XF-104 design led to a contract for 17 YF-104A service test aircraft and a production run of over 2,500 aircraft built both in the United States and under license worldwide . Visible changes from the XF-104 to production versions of the Starfighter include a longer fuselage ( to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel ) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear ( except two-seat versions ) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat . A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program . Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features . Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem . Since the internal fuel capacity was low limiting the useful range of the aircraft , extra capacity was provided on later versions by lengthening the forward fuselage . = = Specifications ( XF-104 ) = = Data from Bowman , Drendel General characteristics Crew : 1 Length : 49 ft 2 in ( 15 m ) Wingspan : 21 ft 11 in ( 6.69 m ) Height : 13 ft 6 in ( 4.1 m ) Wing area : 196 ft \u00b2 ( 18.21 m \u00b2 ) Airfoil : Bi-convex 3.36 % Empty weight : 11,500 lb ( 5,216 kg ) Loaded weight : 16,700 lb ( 7,575 kg ) Max. takeoff weight : 15,700 lb ( 7,120 kg ) Powerplant : 1 \u00d7 Wright J65 turbojet Dry thrust : 7,800 lbf ( 34.70 kN ) Thrust with afterburner : 10,300 lbf ( 45.82 kN ) Performance Maximum speed : 1,151 kn ( 1,324 mph , 2,131 km / h ) Stall speed : 139 kn ( 160 mph , 257 km / h ) Range : 695 nmi ( 800 mi , 1,290 km ) Service ceiling : 50,500 ft ( 15,500 m ) Armament Guns : 1 \u00d7 T171 Vulcan 20 mm ( .79 in ) cannon ( XF-104 083-1002 only )",

                    "text": "Polikarpov I-6 = The Polikarpov I-6 was a Soviet biplane fighter prototype of the late 1920s . It was designed with traditional wooden construction in comparison with the wood and steel tube construction Polikarpov I-5 . Its development took longer than planned and the lead designer , Nikolai Polikarpov , was arrested for industrial sabotage , which only further delayed the project . Only two prototypes were built , as the I-5 was selected for production . = = Design and development = = Development of the I-6 ( Istrebitel ' \u2014 fighter ) began in September 1928 with a deadline for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed . Although the new fighter shared many of the characteristics of the earlier design , including the staggered sesquiplane , single-bay , layout of the wings , it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder , single-row , air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor . It was designed by the OSS ( Russian : Otdel Sookhoputnykh Samolyotov \u2014 Landplane Department ) , later redesignated as OPO-1 ( Russian : Opytnyy Otdel \u2014 Experimental Department ) of Aviatrest ( \" Aviation Trust \" ) under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov , head designer of the department . It was originally intended to be compared to the I-3 , but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5 . Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated . The I-6 had an oval-section semi-monocoque fuselage covered with ' shpon ' , molded birch plywood , with a small headrest faired into the fuselage , although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling . The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile . Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings . The control surfaces were framed in duralumin , but covered in fabric . The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings , and attached the upper wing to the fuselage , had a teardrop profile . They were reinforced with steel bracing wires . The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers . The wooden propeller was given a spinner . The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine , which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant , meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62 % of that of the I-3 . Polikarpov was arrested and imprisoned by the OGPU in September 1929 for the crime of industrial sabotage when neither the I-6 nor the I-5 projects met their stipulated deadlines , and this delayed the first flight of the I-6 until 30 March 1930 . The second prototype was completed shortly thereafter and both aircraft appeared in that year 's May Day fly-past over Moscow . Both aircraft likely used imported engines before they were replaced by the Soviet-built copy of the Jupiter , the Shvetsov M-22 . One I-6 crashed on 13 June 1930 after the test pilot bailed out , without justification , in the opinion of the Soviet aviation historian Vadim B. Shavrov . The I-5 and the I-6 were virtually identical in performance , although the I-6 took 15 seconds to complete a full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5 . Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62 mm ( 0.3 in ) PV-1 machine guns , but the production model of the I-5 was expected to be armed with four , although this proved to impose too great a penalty to the I-5 's performance . The exact reasons for the selection of the I-5 over the I-6 , which was debated for a full year , are not known , but likely relate to both of these factors . Curiously , Polikarpov was not informed of the selection of the I-5 until his release in 1933 after his initial sentence of death had been commuted to ten years of imprisonment in a labor camp . = = Specifications = = Data from Shavrov , Istoriia konstruktskii samoletov v SSSR do 1938 g .

                    "text": "Otto Kittel = Otto \" Bruno \" Kittel ( 21 February 1917 \u2013 14 or 16 February 1945 ) was a World War II Luftwaffe flying ace . He flew 583 combat missions on the Eastern Front , claiming 267 aerial victories , making him the fourth highest scoring ace in aviation history . Kittel claimed all of his victories flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 against the Red Air Force . Kittel joined the Luftwaffe in 1939 , at the age of 22 and flew his first combat missions in 1941 . In spring 1941 , he joined Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 ) supporting Army Group North on the Eastern Front . Kittel claimed his first victory on 22 June 1941 , the opening day of Operation Barbarossa . Kittel took time to amass his personal tally of aerial victories . By February 1943 , he reached 39 kills , relatively insignificant when compared with some other German aces . In 1943 , his tally began to increase when JG 54 began to operate the Fw 190 . Kittel earned the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 29 October 1943 , for reaching 120 aerial victories . By the time he was awarded the decoration he had a tally of 123 victories . Many of the Soviet aircraft shot down by Kittel were IL-2 Shturmoviks . During the remainder of World War II , Kittel was credited with 144 more aerial victories and was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . On 14 or 16 February 1945 , flying his 583rd combat mission , Kittel was shot down and killed by the air gunner of a Shturmovik . Kittel was the most successful German fighter pilot to be killed in action . = = Personal life = = Kittel was born on 21 February 1917 in Kronsdorf ( Krasov ) near Krnov in Sudeten Silesia , Austria-Hungary . His father was Eduard Kittel , a farmer . Contrary to the public perception of fighter pilots , author Franz Kurowski describes Kittel as reserved and soft-spoken . Fascinated with flight at an early age , after working briefly as an auto mechanic Kittel joined the Luftwaffe in 1939 at the age of 22 . After completing his training on 12 February 1941 , Kittel was posted to JG 54 based at Jever , Germany . He was assigned to 2 Staffel ( Squadron ) JG 54 at the rank of Unteroffizier . During his training he was described as a good comrade on account of his calm demeanour , presence of mind and sense of duty . Owing to these attributes , his superior officers treated him with respect . During his training and early career Hannes Trautloft became a role model and offered Kittel advice about his techniques . Kittel formed a friendship with German ace Hans Philipp , who often shared advice about aerial combat . Philipp later served as a pastor when Kittel married his fianc\u00e9 , Edith , in June 1942 at Krasnogvardeysk , after she had travelled into occupied Soviet territory to be with him . The couple had a son , Manfred , who was born in 1945 . = = World War II = = Kittel 's first operations were air superiority missions during the Balkans Campaign . Assigned to support the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the bombing of Belgrade , Kittel 's Geschwader ( Wing ) was credited with 376 aerial victories by the time of the Yugoslavian surrender on 17 April 1941 . During the course of the campaign Kittel acted as wingman for his staffel leader , who was the first to engage any enemy aircraft , and Kittel saw only limited air combat . His only combat actions were during strafing missions against Yugoslav Army forces . On 12 May 1941 , JG 54 handed over its old Bf 109E fighters to Jagdgeschwader 77 ( Fighter Wing 77 ) , and Kittel began intensive training on the new Bf 109F . = = = Operation Barbarossa = = = Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union , began on 22 June 1941 . In the fortnight prior , JG 54 had been moved to an airfield in Lindenthal near Rautenberg , East Prussia , present-day Uslowoje in Kaliningrad Oblast . Tasked with supporting Army Group North in its advance through the Baltic states towards Leningrad , the unit began combat operations shortly afterwards . On 24 June 1941 , Kittel claimed his first two aerial victories , two Tupolev SB-2 bombers , shot down during an early morning mission . On 30 June 1941 , he downed his first Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik . His third victory earned him the Iron Cross , Second Class ( Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse ) . By that time , the German advance had taken JG 54 to Staraya Russa , just south of Leningrad , and they would remain there for nearly two years . By winter 1941 \u2013 1942 , he had 11 victories and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class ( Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse ) in October 1941 . In mid-March , Kittel claimed two Shturmoviks for his 13 \u2013 14 aerial victories but his Bf 109 suffered damage and Kittel returned to base , resisting the urge to chase more and risk his life . His motto was to get back in one piece and avoid risks : \" Take the safe route and avoid ill-considered and wild offensive tactics \" . In the end that alone produced success , risking himself for a single victory was not Kittel 's way . Within two months , his tally had risen to 17 and in May 1942 , Kittel claimed two more victories : a bomber and a fighter , in one sortie . During the combat , he became involved in a dogfight with two experienced opponents ; the Soviet pilots tried to force him into a trap , one chasing the other in an attempt to cut him off . Kittel 's aircraft was fired on several times and hit but he managed to shoot down one of the Soviet fighters and make his escape . = = = Leningrad Front = = = During the summer of 1942 , aerial victories were rare ; operating in the northern sector of the front usually meant little action as all the Soviet air activity was combating Army Group South 's summer offensive , codenamed Case Blue . Kurowski recounts that Kittel became frustrated at this time , although his ground crew worked to keep up his spirits . On 19 February 1943 , Feldwebel Kittel achieved his 39th victory , which was also JG 54 's 4,000th of the war . JG 54 Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commander ) Hannes Trautloft congratulated Kittel , and decreed that he was no longer to be assigned the role of wingman , but would instead be allowed to conduct lone combat patrols . In early 1943 , JG 54 was withdrawn from the frontline to convert to the Fw 190 . With a stronger undercarriage for the harsher conditions on the Eastern Front , greater firepower , speed and agility , the fighter was popular among pilots . Kittel , in particular , was pleased . The Fw 190 was an ideal interceptor against the tough and heavily armoured Shturmovik , his favourite target . At this point , after returning to combat , Kittel 's victory tally climbed rapidly . By mid-March 1943 , Kittel had reached 46 victories , encompassing all types of aircraft . On 14 or 15 March 1943 while on a mission over the Demyansk pocket , Kittel 's Fw 190 suffered engine failure . He was 80 kilometers ( 50 mi ) behind Soviet lines . He removed his precision board clock , an intricately engineered instrument which he was under orders to secure , and landed his Fw 190 which slid 150 meters ( 490 ft ) to a stop in a snow-covered field . During the landing , fellow pilot Herbert Broennle , who had been shot down under similar circumstances , advised Kittel over the radio to hide after landing , to travel only by night and to march compass bearing of 255 degrees ( north-west ) which would take him to Staraya Russa , towards JG 54 's base behind German lines . After exiting his aircraft , Kittel ran for the nearest forest after landing as several locals began emerging from nearby houses . When Kittel got to the forest , he found he had left his emergency rations behind , having only a chocolate bar with him . He continued through the forest . In the dense vegetation , he was able to move during the day unseen . Resting often , he raided several empty houses and found clothes but no food . Determined to find food , and dressed as a Russian peasant , he passed through several Soviet checkpoints looking for something to eat . Kittel spoke Czech and some Russian and managed to evade detection . En route , he stopped at several points and was given food , and eventually Kittel made it to the edge of Lake Ilmen . After nightfall he crossed the frozen lake and made it to German lines , three days after his crash landing . Following his return , Kittel was promoted to Oberfeldwebel ( staff sergeant ) on 18 March 1943 . Kittel took leave in March / April 1943 . By the time he returned Walter Nowotny had taken over the Gruppe ( Group ) . Philipp had left to take command of Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 ) in Germany , and was later killed in action on 8 October 1943 . On 3 May 1943 , Kittel scored his first aerial victories since his return , claiming three Soviet aircraft in an operation before machine gun fire from a bomber 's rear gunner damaged his aircraft and forced him to crash land . On 10 June 1943 , Kittel achieved another aerial victory , taking his total to 50 . = = = Kursk and the Baltic = = = During the fighting in mid-1943 , JG 54 took part in many of the spring battles over the Crimea Peninsula , Vyazma-Bryansk , Vitebsk , Kharkov , Orsha and Orel regions . As the spring battles ended , the Germans prepared for Operation Citadel , which led to the Battle of Kursk . During the air battles that followed Kittel 's unit escorted Junkers Ju 87 Stukas of III . / Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ( Third Group , StG 2 , or Dive Bomber Wing 2 ) , commanded by Hans-Ulrich Rudel . On 5 July 1943 , the Germans launched their attack . By this date , Kittel had claimed 56 victories . During the first day of Citadel , Kittel became an \" ace-in-a-day \" claiming six victories . The next day he shot down three more Soviet aircraft . It was at this point Kittel achieved recognition as one of the most prominent German aces . After the German defeat at Kursk , Kittel 's combat career continued as the German Army retreated to the Dnieper River . Kittel had achieved a one kill per day average to reach 94 victories on 4 September 1943 . Just 10 days later , on 14 September 1943 , Kittel claimed his 100th aerial victory , a Yakovlev Yak-9 fighter . The 53rd Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark , he received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 29 October 1943 . By the time he was awarded it on 29 October , his tally was 123 aerial victories . The presentation was made by Oberst Franz Reu\u00df . On 1 November 1943 , Kittel was promoted to the rank of Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) . From then until January 1944 Kittel served a the chief instructor of the Erg\u00e4nzungs-Jagdgruppe Ost ( Training Group East ) in Biarritz , France , providing instructor to trainee fighter pilots . Unhappy in a teaching role , Kittel filed several applications to return to combat , and in March 1944 his request was approved . Kittel subsequently returned to JG 54 on the Eastern Front . In early April , achieved his 150th aerial victory . On April 14 , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) for his 152nd aerial victory , claimed on 12 April . Kittel received the Oak Leaves from Adolf Hitler at the Berghof , Obersalzberg on 5 May 1944 , becoming the 449th German to receive the award . In May 1944 , 2 . Staffel was transferred to augment III . Gruppe ( 3rd group ) of JG 54 fighting on the Western Front to provide air defense for the Reich amidst increasing Allied aerial attacks . In August 1944 , a new 2 . Staffel was formed from remnants of 3 . Staffel , and Kittel was appointed its Staffelkapit\u00e4n ( squadron leader ) . Kittel continued to increase his tally , shooting down another 50 aircraft by 26 August 1944 , bringing his overall total to 200 . By this time , Kittel had converted to flying a Fw 190A-6 , designated \" Yellow 5 \" . By the 27 October 1944 , Kittel had achieved 254 victories , a total of 102 in just six months . He earned the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern ) on 25 November 1944 for 264 victories , only the 113th German serviceman to receive the award . Kittel flew to Hitler 's headquarters to receive the award and then continued to Germany to spend his leave there . When he returned in January 1945 , he took JG 54 's second squadron , 2 Staffel . Kittel added a further three victories during his time as the Staffel 's leader . By 13 February 1945 , Kittel had a personal total of 266 aerial victories . At 12 : 06 on 14 or 16 February 1945 , Kittel took off with his Geschwader ( Wing ) flying Fw 190 A-8 \" Black 1 \" ( Werknummer \u2014 factory number \u2014 690 282 ) to engage a formation of 14 Shturmovik aircraft over the Courland Pocket . His wingman , Oberf\u00e4hnrich Renner , later reported : At 12 : 13 he made contact with the formation at low altitude , no more than 100 \u2013 150 meters ( 330 \u2013 490 ft ) . Kittel attacked , firing at and damaging several Shturmovik . Kittel damaged one aircraft and chased it . As he closed in for the kill , his Focke-Wulf was hit by return fire from a rear gunner , and descended towards the ground on fire . Kittel , probably incapacitated and unable to use his parachute , did not bail out and the Fw 190 crashed in flames . The site of the crash is believed to have been 6 kilometers ( 3.7 mi ) south-west of D\u017e\u016bkste in Latvia . Witnesses from Kittel 's formation reported that a Shturmovik had been shot down by Kittel before he himself was killed during the air battle having scored his 267th and final victory . = = Awards = = Wound Badge in Black Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe on 21 December 1942 as Feldwebel and pilot Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe in Gold with Pennant \" 500 \" Combined Pilots-Observation Badge German Cross in Gold on 18 March 1943 as Feldwebel in the 2 . / JG 54 Iron Cross ( 1939 ) 2nd Class ( 30 June 1941 ) 1st Class ( October 1941 ) Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords Knight 's Cross on 29 October 1943 as Oberfeldwebel ( Master Sergeant or First Sergeant ) and pilot in the 2 . / JG 54 449th Oak Leaves on 11 April 1944 as Leutnant ( Second Lieutenant ) pilot in the 1 . / JG 54 113th Swords on 25 November 1944 as Oberleutnant ( First Lieutenant ) ( war officer ) and Staffelkapit\u00e4n of the 2 . / JG 54",

                    "text": "No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF = No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 5 EFTS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) pilot training unit that operated during World War II . It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme . No. 5 EFTS was established in June 1940 at Narromine , New South Wales , and primarily operated Tiger Moths . It ceased training in June 1944 , after more than 3,700 students had passed through . = = History = = Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre-war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 \u2013 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF 's initial training schools . Flying training was undertaken in two stages : the first involved four weeks of instruction ( including ten hours of flying ) to determine trainees ' suitability to become pilots . Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training ( including sixty-five hours of flying ) at the EFTS . Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators . No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 5 EFTS ) was formed at Narromine , New South Wales , on 24 May 1940 , and came under the control of Central Area Command , headquartered in Sydney . Its inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader T.C. Curnow , who was previously in charge of No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School at Archerfield , Queensland . No. 5 EFTS 's airfield had been home to the Narromine Aero Club before being taken over by the RAAF . Twenty de Havilland Tiger Moth training aircraft were flown in from Laverton , Victoria , on 24 June , and flying training commenced three days later when the first forty-six students arrived from No. 1 Initial Training School . Within a month , student numbers had grown to ninety-four , and the school 's total strength was 346 . As of 30 June 1940 , only one of the No. 5 EFTS 's four required hangars had been completed . Accommodation facilities were , according to the unit operations book , \" bleak and depressing \" and deficiencies in equipment were \" too numerous for itemising \" . The primitive conditions meant that personnel suffered adverse health effects from the cold in winter and hot , dusty conditions in the summer . Flying at Narromine was also hampered by bad weather , particularly heavy rain and wind . Accidents were frequent at all EFTSs , though fatalities were rare . An instructor and his passenger from No. 5 EFTS were killed when a Tiger Moth crashed on 3 August 1940 , possibly caused by a stall while practising forced landings . By the end of August , the school was operating one of its two required Link Trainer simulators . As of 30 September 1940 , total strength was 467 , including 114 trainees . One student died and five others were injured off duty when the balcony of the Federal Hotel in Narromine collapsed on 11 November . An instructor was killed and his pupil injured when their Tiger Moth stalled while attempting to avoid collision with another aircraft on 3 December . Later that month , Squadron Leader Roy King , a fighter ace in the Australian Flying Corps during World War I , took over command of the school , serving until June 1941 . By that time , some 500 pupils had graduated from No. 5 EFTS ; the wastage rate was just under twenty per cent . Among the graduates was R.H. ( Ron ) Middleton , who subsequently flew with the Royal Air Force in Europe and was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions piloting a Short Stirling bomber in November 1942 . Night-flying training commenced at No. 5 EFTS in July 1941 . As of 30 April 1942 , the school 's strength was 845 personnel , including 319 students , the increase owing to an influx of staff and students from No. 2 EFTS and No. 6 Elementary Flying Training School in Tamworth , New South Wales , both of which had been disbanded in March . By July 1943 , total strength stood at 748 , including thirty-three members of the Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force ( WAAAF ) ; the unit was operating eighty-seven Tiger Moths and one Ryan . In April 1944 , WAAAF numbers reached eighty-four out of a total strength of 703 ; the aircraft complement was eighty-six Tiger Moths , seventy-one of which were serviceable , and two CAC Wacketts , neither serviceable . No. 48 Course passed out on 15 June 1944 , after which training at the school ceased . Three other courses then under way were completed at other EFTSs . By 25 June , all of the school 's Tiger Moths had been transferred to other locations . A total of 3,734 students had passed through No. 5 EFTS , 2,850 of whom graduated as pilots . = = = Works consulted = = = Ashworth , Norman ( 2000 ) . How Not to Run an Air Force !

                    "text": "HMS Vindictive ( 1918 ) = HMS Vindictive was a warship built during the First World War for the Royal Navy ( RN ) . Originally designed as a Hawkins-class heavy cruiser and laid down under the name Cavendish , she was converted into an aircraft carrier while still building . Renamed in 1918 , she was completed a few weeks before the end of the war and saw no active service with the Grand Fleet . The following year she participated in the British campaign in the Baltic against the Bolsheviks during which her aircraft made numerous attacks against the naval base at Kronstadt . Vindictive returned home at the end of the year and was placed in reserve for several years before her flight decks were removed and she was reconverted back into a cruiser . The ship retained her aircraft hangar and conducted trials with a aircraft catapult before she was sent to the China Station in 1926 . A year after her return in 1928 , she was again placed in reserve . Vindictive was demilitarized and converted into a training ship in 1936 \u2013 1937 . At the beginning of the Second World War she was converted into a repair ship . Her first role after the conversion was completed in early 1940 , however , was to transport troops during the Norwegian Campaign . She was then sent to the South Atlantic to support British ships serving there and , in late 1942 , to the Mediterranean to support the ships there . Vindictive returned home in 1944 and was damaged by a German torpedo off the coast of Normandy after the Allies invaded France . She was reduced to reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1946 . = = Background and description = = The Hawkins-class cruiser was designed to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas . This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders . The design was also given high freeboard to allow it to maintain its speed in heavy weather . Sir Eustace Tennyson d 'Eyncourt , the Director of Naval Construction , included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions . Four ships were ordered , named after famous Elizabethan seafarers , in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916 , named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish . By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended , so construction proceeded slowly . The cruisers had an overall length of 605 feet ( 184.4 m ) , a beam of 65 feet ( 19.8 m ) , and a mean draught of 19 feet 3 inches ( 5.9 m ) at deep load . They were designed to displace 9,750 long tons ( 9,906 t ) and had a complement of 37 officers and 672 enlisted men . The ships had four Parsons geared steam turbines , each of which drove one propeller shaft . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 60,000 shaft horsepower ( 45,000 kW ) for a speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by 12 Yarrow boilers ; 8 of these were oil-fired while the remaining 4 used coal . They had a stowage capacity of 800 long tons ( 810 t ) of coal and 1,600 long tons ( 1,600 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 5,400 nautical miles ( 10,000 km ; 6,200 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The main armament of the Hawkins-class cruisers consisted of seven 45-calibre 7.5 in ( 190 mm ) Mk VI guns in pivot mounts . They were arranged in two superfiring pairs , one each fore and aft of the superstructure , one on each broadside abreast the rear funnel , and the last was on the quarterdeck at the same level as the lower of the rear superfiring pair ; they were designated 1 through 7 from front to rear . At maximum elevation these guns fired a 200-pound ( 91 kg ) shell to a range of 21,114 yards ( 19,307 m ) . Their secondary armament comprised a dozen quick-firing ( QF ) 3-inch 20 cwt guns . Eight of these were on low-angle mounts intended for use against torpedo boats and the remaining four were on high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defence . They also mounted two submerged tubes , one on each broadside , and four above-water tubes , two on each broadside , for 21-inch torpedoes . The Hawkins-class cruisers were protected with an armour that had a maximum thickness of 4 inches abreast the ships ' magazines and a minimum thickness of 1.5 inches ( 38 mm ) . It consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel of varying thicknesses that covered most of the ships ' sides . The decks had a maximum thickness of 1 \u2013 1.5 in ( 25 \u2013 38 mm ) over the engine rooms , boilers , and the steering gear . The conning tower and its communication tube were protected by the only Krupp cemented armour in the ships and had thicknesses of 3 inches and 2 inches ( 51 mm ) respectively . = = = Conversion into an aircraft carrier = = = In January 1917 , the Board of Admiralty reviewed the navy 's aircraft carrier requirements and decided to order two ships fitted with a flying-off deck as well as a landing deck aft . The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities , so the Admiralty decided to convert Cavendish , already under construction , in June 1917 . No. 2 7.5-inch gun , two 3-inch guns and the conning tower were removed and the forward superstructure was remodelled into a 78 by 49 feet ( 23.8 by 14.9 m ) hangar with a capacity for six reconnaissance aircraft . The hangar roof , with a small extension , formed the 106-foot ( 32 m ) flying-off deck . The aircraft were hoisted up through a hatch at the aft end of the flying-off deck by two derricks . The 193 by 57 feet ( 58.8 by 17.4 m ) landing deck required the removal of Nos. 5 and 6 7.5-inch guns and moving the four 3-inch AA guns to an elevated platform between the funnels , in lieu of the 3-inch guns intended for that position . A port side gangway 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) wide connected the landing and flying-off decks to allow aircraft with their wings folded to be wheeled from one to the other . A crash barrier was hung from \" the gallows \" at the forward end of the landing on deck . To increase her stability after the addition of so much topweight , the upper portion of her anti-torpedo bulge was enlarged . Although still overweight compared to her designed displacement , the modifications made the ship lighter than her sister ships , at 9,344 long tons ( 9,494 t ) light displacement and a metacentric height of 3.59 feet ( 1.1 m ) . She completed her sea trials on 21 September 1918 and reached a speed of 29.12 knots ( 53.93 km / h ; 33.51 mph ) from 63,600 shaft horsepower ( 47,400 kW ) . = = Construction and career = = Cavendish was laid down at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast on 26 June 1916 and launched on 17 January 1918 . In June she was renamed Vindictive , the fifth ship of that name in the RN , to perpetuate the name of the old protected cruiser Vindictive , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May . She commissioned on 1 October and , after briefly working up , joined the Grand Fleet 's Flying Squadron on 18 October only a few weeks before the Armistice on 11 November . For the rest of the year she conducted flying trials and exercises , including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft , of which two were lost in accidents . The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet 's last operational Sopwith Pup . Experiments conducted earlier aboard the larger Furious , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels , had demonstrated that the turbulence from these was enough to make successful landings almost impossible at high speed . Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving . Vindictive was dispatched to the Baltic with a dozen aircraft , a mix of Griffins , Sopwith 2F.1 fighters , Sopwith 1 \u00bd Strutter and Short Type 184 bombers , on 2 July 1919 to participate in the British campaign in the Baltic in support of the White Russians and the newly independent Baltic states . On 6 July she ran aground on a shoal near Reval at speed . Stuck hard in the tideless Baltic , all of her fuel was dumped overboard , and most of her ammunition as well . Some 2,200 long tons ( 2,200 t ) of stores were also off-loaded , but the ship could not be towed free by the combined efforts of the light cruisers Danae and Cleopatra and three tugboats . Eight days after grounding a fortuitous westerly wind began that raised the water level by 8 inches ( 203 mm ) , just enough to pull the ship free . Unbeknownst to the British the entire operation had taken place in a minefield . The carrier unloaded her air group , commanded by Major Grahame Donald , at Biorko , Finland on 14 July . Their airfield was still under construction , but they were able to fly a reconnaissance mission over the major Bolshevik naval base at Kronstadt on 26 July while Vindictive sailed to Copenhagen , Denmark , to load aircraft and spares left for her by the carrier Argus . Four days later , Rear Admiral Walter Cowan ordered Donald and his aircraft to attack Kronstadt at night . As their airfield was not yet finished , the ship 's flying-off deck was extended to 118 feet ( 36.0 m ) to better allow the bombers to take off with their 112-pound ( 51 kg ) bombs . Accurate anti-aircraft fire kept the aircraft too high for an effective attack , but Donald 's men claimed two hits on the submarine tender Pamiat Azova . In reality one bomb struck the oil tanker Tatiana , setting it on fire and killing one man . That same day eight RN Coastal Motor Boat ( CMB ) s arrived ; Vindictive served as their depot ship . Vindictive 's aircraft continued to support British operations against the Bolsheviks until they left the Baltic in December , although no further missions were flown from the carrier . They shot down a helium-filled observation balloon and spotted for ships conducted shore bombardments . Most importantly , nine of them attacked Kronstadt during the night of 17 / 18 August 1919 to provide a diversion for an attack by the CMBs on ships in Kronstadt harbour . As a result , the torpedo boats damaged the battleship Andrei Pervozvanny and sank Pamiat Azova . In subsequent attacks on Kronstadt , they nearly hit Andrei Pervozvanny while she was in drydock , nearly hit a minesweeper , killing one crewman from the explosion , and hit two auxiliary ships . By December it was clear that the Whites ' offensive against Petrograd had failed and the British began withdrawing ; Vindictive left three Camels in Latvia , embarked the rest of her aircraft and sailed for home on 22 December . She was paid off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 December and received permanent repairs of her damage from the grounding , at a cost of \u00a3 200,000 . Furious and Vindictive had proven that the idea of \" cruiser-carriers \" was unworkable due to the turbulence from their superstructures and that a complete flight deck was necessary to successfully operate aircraft at sea . The Admiralty had considered converting her to that configuration , with an island , in July 1918 while still building , but had decided to wait on the results of tests conducted with Argus evaluating different designs for the island . Vindictive was thought to be too small to be an effective carrier and the financial restrictions in place after the war vitiated against such a major reconstruction . = = = As cruiser = = = For the next several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport , until she began reconversion into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923 . The flight decks were removed and she was mostly restored to her designed configuration , although her 3-inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns . Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7.5-inch guns . The major exception was that No. 2 7.5-inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure . The two derricks that serviced the hangar were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of the hangar roof . No. 2 's position was occupied by a prototype compressed-air Carey aircraft catapult , the first British cruiser to mount a catapult . Vindictive used it for the first time on 3 October when she launched a Fairey IIID floatplane . She also conducted catapult trials on float-equipped Fairey Flycatcher fighters . She sailed for the China Station on 1 January 1926 with six Fairey IIIDs aboard for anti-piracy patrols and departed for home on 14 March 1928 . She arrived in May and her catapult was removed in October , ending her career as an aviation ship . Vindictive was again reduced to reserve in 1929 , making occasional trooping voyages . = = = As training ship = = = In 1936 \u2013 1937 , Vindictive was demilitarised in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty and converted to a training ship for cadets . Her two inboard propellers were removed as were the inboard turbines ; half of her boilers were removed and their compartments were converted into accommodations . The aft funnel was removed , the aft superstructure remodelled and enlarged and her hangar converted into more accommodation space . Her armament , including the above-water torpedo tubes , was replaced by a pair of 4.7-inch ( 120 mm ) guns forward and a quadruple QF 2-pounder ( \" pom-pom \" ) AA mount aft . In this form she displaced 9,100 long tons ( 9,200 t ) and was capable of a maximum speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . She was recommissioned on 7 September 1937 . = = = As fleet repair ship = = = After the Second World War began in August 1939 , Vindictive was transferred to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister Effingham , with nine 6-inch ( 152 mm ) guns , four twin-gun 4-inch ( 100 mm ) mounts and a catapult . She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October , when a less complex modernisation was considered . This proposal had six 6-inch guns and three 4-inch AA guns , and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range , but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship . Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar 's roof . Her aft superstructure was extended to be flush with her sides and slightly lengthened , and a large deckhouse was built on the quarterdeck . Her armament now consisted of six single 4-inch QF Mk V AA guns , all on the centreline , two quadruple \" pom-pom \" mounts , one on each side , and six depth charges . In this role , she had a standard displacement of 10,000 long tons ( 10,000 t ) ( 12,000 long tons ( 12,000 t ) at full load ) and her draught increased to 20 feet 3 inches ( 6.2 m ) . The conversion was completed on 30 March 1940 , just in time for the ship to be used with the Home Fleet as a troop transport during the Norwegian Campaign . She ferried British troops to Narvik in late April and escorted an evacuation convoy from Harstad on 4 June . Vindictive was transferred to the South Atlantic later in the year and remained there until late 1942 , when she was ordered north . On the night of 12 November , she was attacked west of Gibraltar by the German submarine U-515 , but managed to evade the torpedoes . U-515 sank the accompanying destroyer tender Hecla and blew the stern off one of the escorting destroyers , Marne . She remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1944 , when she was recalled to support the ships participating in Operation Overlord . During this time she received her first radars . By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set as well as a Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar . By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar . Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon , three on each side of the roof of the large workshop abaft the funnel . In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons . Later that year , the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added . In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons . In early August 1944 , the ship was damaged by a long-range , circling , \" Dackel \" torpedo dropped by the Luftwaffe off the coast of Normandy . She was paid off into reserve on 8 September 1945 and was sold for scrap on 24 January 1946 . Vindictive was subsequently broken up at Blyth .",

                    "text": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A. Richardson , Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Sanborn Contracts- 1874 ) ( Resigned and appointed Federal Judge by Grant . ) George H. Williams , Attorney General \u2013 ( Pratt & Boyd- 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Columbus Delano , Secretary of Interior \u2013 ( Bogus Agents \u2013 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Orville E. Babcock , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Black Friday \u2013 1869 ) ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Safe Burglary Conspiracy \u2013 1876 ) ( Acquitted in Saint Louis Whiskey Ring trials by jury due to Grant 's defense testimony in his favor . ) John McDonald , Internal Revenue Supervisor , St. Louis \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Indicted and convicted ; served prison time ; claimed Grant was involved in the Whiskey Ring but did not supply any evidence . ) Horace Porter , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) William W. Belknap , Secretary of War \u2013 ( Trading Post Ring- 1876 ) ( Resigned ; Convicted by House ; acquitted by Senate ; indictments against Belknap in Washington D.C. court were dropped by judge at request of Grant and Attorney General Alphonso Taft . ) George M. Robeson , Secretary of Navy \u2013 ( Naval Department Ring- 1876 ) ( Grant defended Robeson in State of the Union address . Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P. Bradley \u2013 1870 Ward Hunt \u2013 1873 Morrison Remick Waite ( Chief Justice ) \u2013 1874 = = = States admitted to the Union = = = Colorado \u2013 August 1 , 1876 Colorado came into the Union just in time to give enough electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

                    "text": "Garry Moore = Garry Moore ( January 31 , 1915 \u2013 November 28 , 1993 ) was an American entertainer , game show host , and comedian best known for his work in television . He began his career as a radio personality in the 1940s and was a television host on several game and variety shows from the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s . After dropping out of high school , Moore found success as a radio host and then moved on to the television industry . He hosted The Garry Moore Show , and the game shows I 've Got a Secret and To Tell the Truth . He became known for his bow ties and his crew cut , though he refrained from both fashions later in his career . After being diagnosed with throat cancer in 1976 , Moore retired from the television industry , making a few rare television appearances . He spent the last years of his life in Hilton Head , South Carolina and at his summer home in Maine . He died on November 28 , 1993 . = = Early life and radio career = = Moore was born Thomas Garrison Morfit , III on January 31 , 1915 , in Baltimore , Maryland , the son of Mason P. Morfit and Mary L. ( n\u00e9e Harris ) Morfit . He attended Baltimore City College ( actually a high school ) , but dropped out to pursue a career in radio and writing . Starting in 1937 , he worked for Baltimore radio station WBAL as an announcer , writer , and actor / comedian . He used his birth name until 1940 , when , while on the air announcing Club Matinee hosted by Ransom Sherman at NBC , Chicago , Sherman held a radio contest to find a more easily pronounceable one . \" Garry Moore \" was the winning entry , which was submitted by a woman from Pittsburgh who received a prize of $ 100 . It was on Club Matinee where he met his long-time friend and broadcasting partner Durward Kirby . Moore headed Talent , Ltd . , a variety program on Sunday afternoons in 1941 . In the years that followed , Moore appeared on numerous network radio shows . He started out as an announcer and then as support for broadcast personalities , one of whom was Jimmy Durante . From 1943 \u2013 1947 , Durante and Moore had a joint show , with Moore as the straight man . Impressed with his ability to interact with audiences , CBS offered him his own show . Starting in 1949 , the one-hour daytime variety show The Garry Moore Show aired on CBS . Moore briefly returned to radio as host of NBC 's Monitor in 1969 . = = Television career = = Between 1947 and 1950 , Moore began to make tentative steps into the new medium as a panelist and guest host on quiz and musical shows . On June 26 , 1950 , he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program , The Garry Moore Show , which was a shorter version of his radio show . Until September 1950 , it was also simulcast on radio . During 1950 and 1951 , he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for Arthur Godfrey and his Friends . He appeared as a guest star on other programs , too , including CBS 's Faye Emerson 's Wonderful Town . During his run as a variety-show host , Moore was tapped to host CBS ' weekly prime-time TV panel show I 've Got a Secret . It premiered on June 19 , 1952 . On this show , Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and panelist Bill Cullen , with whom he also had a long working relationship . Morgan later stated that Moore had helped him to keep his job as a celebrity panelist on the show . Moore became known for his involvement in the variety of stunts and demonstrations of the show 's contestants . The popularity of I 've Got a Secret led to a cameo in the 1959 film It Happened to Jane . In the film , Doris Day 's character was a contestant on the show , with Moore , as well as the panel playing themselves . Moore 's variety program was moved to the daytime slot , where it ran until June 27 , 1958 . Within three months of the end of the daytime show , his longtime colleague Durward Kirby and he moved the revived The Garry Moore Show into prime time as a Tuesday night comedy and variety hour that ran from September 30 , 1958 , to June 14 , 1964 . Although the show was a bigger hit in prime time , Moore always preferred the daytime housewife audience . He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked . The show provided a break into show business for many performers , including Alan King , Jonathan Winters , Carol Burnett , and Dorothy Loudon . The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby , Marion Lorne , Denise Lor , and Ken Carson , as well as a mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits , and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett . After the show ended , Burnett became a star in her own right , hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years . The Garry Moore Show was cancelled in 1964 , and in the summer of that year , after having been on radio and television for 27 uninterrupted years , Moore decided to retire , saying he had \" said everything [ he ] ever wanted to say three times already . \" He gave up hosting I 've Got A Secret and was replaced by comedian Steve Allen , who would host the show until the end of its run in 1967 ( although Moore had ended his retirement before I 've Got A Secret left the air , he never returned to the series to host and Allen helmed a subsequent , one-season syndicated revival in 1972 ) . Moore 's main activity during his hiatus was a trip around the world with his wife . After two years , The Garry Moore Show returned to the CBS prime-time lineup in the fall of 1966 . The week of the premiere , Moore appeared as the celebrity guest on I 've Got A Secret to promote it . The new show was canceled mid-season because of low ratings against NBC 's highly rated western Bonanza . The successful Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour replaced The Garry Moore Show in the CBS time slot . Moore then made sporadic guest television appearances , appearing as a panelist on various game shows , before Mark Goodson asked him to host another show . That show was a revival of To Tell the Truth , which had ended its run on CBS in 1968 . Moore was asked to host a revival of the series for syndication , which launched in September 1969 . When To Tell the Truth was planned to be revived for syndication , producers Mark Goodson and Bill Todman originally wanted Bud Collyer to once again host the show . However , when they called Collyer , he declined , citing his poor health . When Goodson and Todman called Moore about the job , he immediately contacted Collyer , who said to Moore that \" I am just not up to it . \" Moore often took part in the show 's silly and goofy stunts , as he had done on I 've Got a Secret , performing magic tricks and cooking . This led to this version of To Tell the Truth being labeled similar to I 've Got a Secret . Moore hosted the series from its premiere until the midway point of the 1976 \u2013 77 season , the revival 's eighth . = = Recording = = In 1956 , Moore recorded a Columbia LP record album for children . It featured tales by Rudyard Kipling , including \" The Elephant 's Child \" and \" How the Camel Got His Hump . \" Also in 1956 , Moore recorded a Columbia LP record album titled \" Garry Moore Presents My Kind Of Music , \" with contributions by jazz musicians George Barnes , Ernie Caceres , Wild Bill Davison , Randy Hall , Mel Henke , and Sonny Terry . = = Retirement and death = = Moore became ill in 1976 and was diagnosed with throat cancer . He left To Tell the Truth shortly before Christmas 1976 to undergo surgery , turning the show over to panelist Bill Cullen . Semiregular panelist Joe Garagiola also acted as the host for several weeks , claiming he was \" pinch-hitting \" for Moore . Moore returned in September 1977 to begin To Tell the Truth 's ninth season , to explain his sudden absence and to announce his permanent retirement , explaining that while recovering from his surgery , he believed that his throat cancer was a sign that continuing beyond his 42-year career would be \" just plain greed \" . Joe Garagiola hosted the program for the rest of the season , which proved to be its last . Moore retired to Hilton Head , South Carolina , where he spent his time sailing , and also at his summer home in Northeast Harbor , Maine . He made two rare television appearances during his retirement , in a 1984 special on game-show bloopers hosted by William Shatner and in a late 1980s television tribute to Carol Burnett . Moore recounted the time circumstances forced Burnett and him to share a dressing room for one show . After many years , Moore said he had a confession to make : \" I peeked . \" Burnett replied , \" So did I. \" Moore died of emphysema at Hilton Head on November 28 , 1993 , at the age of 78 . He was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Northeast Harbor , Maine . He was named one of the 15 greatest game-show hosts of all time by Time .",

She was raised mainly on the East Coast , spending the rest of her youth in Massachusetts and Connecticut .

Bosworth 's performance however , was not well received among critics ; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted , \" The new Lois Lane , Kate Bosworth , is not a patch on Margot Kidder , or , for that matter , on Teri Hatcher , in the TV series . \" San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth , at the age of 22 years , was too young to portray Lois Lane , and the climax did not \" match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film \" . Although Bosworth 's performance was ambivalently received , she herself loved the experience of working on the movie . As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006 , \" You know how you have an experience , a time in your life when you feel you 've come into your own ? When you grow up a bit , and think , Now I get it ?

He appeared frequently in theatre , film and on television from the 1930s to the 1970s . His best known screen roles were as Professor Bernard Quatermass in the BBC Television serial Quatermass and the Pit ( 1958 \u2013 59 ) , and as Doctor Watson in the Hammer Film Productions version of The Hound of the Baskervilles ( 1959 ) . He also appeared in the films The Bridge on the River Kwai ( 1957 ) and Ben-Hur ( 1959 ) , in several of Hammer 's horror films throughout the 1960s and in the acclaimed ITV historical drama The Caesars ( 1968 ) . His obituary in The Times newspaper described him as possessing a \" commanding presence with a rich , responsive voice \u2026 whether in the classical or modern theatre he was authoritative and dependable . \" = = Biography = = = = = Early life and career = = = Morell was born Cecil Andr\u00e9 Mesritz in London , England , the son of Andr\u00e9 and Rosa Mesritz . Prior to taking up acting professionally he trained as a motor engineer , while also participating in amateur theatrical productions . He turned professional in 1934 , initially acting under the name Andr\u00e9 Mesritz ; he anglicised this to Andr\u00e9 Morell in 1936 , and adopted the latter name legally by deed poll in 1938 . In 1938 he joined the Old Vic theatre company , and appeared in several of their high-profile productions both at their home theatre and on tour throughout Britain and across the rest of the world . He appeared in Hamlet as Horatio opposite Alec Guinness in the title role , and as Alonso in John Gielgud 's production of The Tempest . He played Mercutio in a production of Romeo and Juliet mounted by the Old Vic company at Streatham in 1939 , with Robert Donat as Romeo . This was Morell 's favourite role from his career . His performance in the play was praised by The Times 's critic as \" a neat and carefully studied portrait ; he is admirable in all his cynical and humorous passages \" , although the reviewer did add that \" one could wish that he had left this manner for the speech about Queen Mab and addressed this , as a piece of direct poetry , directly to the audience . \" Towards the end of the 1930s he began appearing in films , making his debut on the big screen in 13 Men and a Gun ( 1938 ) . He appeared frequently in several early drama productions on the BBC 's fledgling television service , featuring in such roles as Mr Wickham in Pride and Prejudice ( 1938 ) and Le Bret in Cyrano de Bergerac ( 1938 ) . The onset of World War II interrupted his acting career , and he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1940 . He served with the regiment until 1946 , by which time he had attained the rank of major . = = = Major film and television roles = = = Morell returned to the theatre after the war , including another period at the Old Vic in the 1951 \u2013 52 season . The New Statesman 's critic T. C. Worsley wrote of his performance in a star-studded revival of King Lear that \" Mr Morell 's Kent is the best I remember since Sir Ralph Richardson 's . \" Of his performance in the title role in Tyrone Guthrie 's production of Timon of Athens , the Daily Mail wrote : \" From his stage and screen performances we know him already as an eminently dependable actor , but last night he became a spectacular actor . \" The same profile quoted Morell 's catholic approach to stage assignments : \" If a part is a good part and I feel I can enjoy playing it , it doesn 't matter whether it 's Shakespeare or modern farce \u2026 I 'd hate to be bogged down in Shakespeare or classic theatre all my life . It 's a good thing for an actor to do many different kinds of theatre , because it keeps his imagination stimulated . \" However , he now increasingly began to win leading parts on television , and in 1953 was cast by the television director Rudolph Cartier in a play called It Is Midnight , Dr Schweitzer . Cartier was impressed with Morell 's performance in this play , and offered him the leading role in a science-fiction serial he was preparing with the writer Nigel Kneale , entitled The Quatermass Experiment . Morell considered the not-yet-completed script , but decided to decline the offer ; the part went instead to his co-star from It Is Midnight , Dr Schweitzer , Reginald Tate . He did take one of the leading parts in another Cartier and Kneale production the following year , when he played O 'Brien in their version of George Orwell 's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four , opposite Peter Cushing as Winston Smith . This was a successful and controversial production which provoked much comment and debate ; Morell 's part in it has been praised for his \" coolly menacing performance [ that ] is at least equal to Cushing 's . \" This successful collaboration with Cartier and Kneale resulted , four years later , in him once again being offered the role of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the pair 's third serial in the series , Quatermass and the Pit , although on this occasion another actor \u2013 Alec Clunes \u2013 had already turned them down . This time Morell accepted the part , and is regarded by several critics as having provided the definitive interpretation of the character . Morell personally found that in later years it was the role for which he was most often remembered by members of the public . As well as these and other television appearances , Morell gained several notable film roles towards the end of the 1950s . He appeared in two films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture ; The Bridge on the River Kwai ( 1957 ) , as Colonel Green , and Ben-Hur ( 1959 ) as Sextus . With Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes , he played Arthur Conan Doyle 's character Doctor John H. Watson , in Hammer Film Productions ' version of The Hound of the Baskervilles ( also 1959 ) . Morell was particularly keen that his portrayal of Watson should be closer to that originally depicted in Conan Doyle 's stories , and away from the bumbling stereotype established by Nigel Bruce 's interpretation of the role . An earlier Hammer film in which Morell appeared was The Camp on Blood Island ( 1957 ) . In 1960 , Morell appeared as Judge Brack in a production of Henrik Ibsen 's play Hedda Gabler at the Oxford Playhouse . Starring opposite him in the title role was the film actress Joan Greenwood . They fell in love and flew in secret to Jamaica , where they were married , remaining together until his death . = = = Later career = = = Morell continued to appear in Hammer 's horror films in the ensuing decade . He had parts in the Shadow of the Cat ( 1960 ) , She ( 1964 , again with Peter Cushing ) and its sequel Vengeance of She ( 1967 ) , the lead in The Plague of the Zombies ( 1965 ) , and The Mummy 's Shroud ( 1966 ) . He also starred with Cushing in Hammer 's Cash on Demand , playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play , The Gold Inside . He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer 's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit ( 1967 ) . He did not wish to repeat himself . Morell continued to act successfully on television throughout the decade , with guest roles in episodes of series such as The Avengers ( 1963 and 1965 ) , Danger Man ( 1965 ) , Doctor Who ( \" The Massacre of St Bartholomew 's Eve \" 1966 ) , The Saint ( 1965 ) and in The Caesars ( 1968 ) in a prominent role as the Roman emperor Tiberius . In 1969 , he became the vice president of Equity , the trade union for British actors and performers . He then served as president of the organisation for a year from 1973 \u2013 74 . During this time he was involved in a dispute in which Equity threatened to expel Laurence Olivier as a member due to comments he made in a newspaper feature about the possibility of forming a breakaway union . The union also suffered from financial problems , and Morell continued to warn against destructive divisions amongst the members when he stepped down as president . Despite his involvement in union business he continued to be a busy working actor . He appeared in Stanley Kubrick 's Barry Lyndon ( 1975 ) as a nobleman friend of the title character . His last television work was an episode of the ITV series The Professionals in 1978 , the year of his death . The animated film version of The Lord of the Rings , in which he voiced the character of Elrond , was released the same year , but his final film work was not seen until the year after his death . This was as the judge in The First Great Train Robbery . Morell , who smoked up to 60 cigarettes a day until he gave up in 1976 , died from lung cancer in London on 28 November 1978 , at the age of 69 . He was survived by his wife Joan Greenwood and their son Jason . Jason Morell also became an actor , appearing in films such as Mrs. Brown ( 1997 , as Lord Stanley ) and Wilde ( also 1997 , as Ernest Dowson ) . = = Filmography = =",

Both films also featured memorable performances from a number of young male actors who would go on to become leading men in the next decade ( as well as members of the so-called \" Brat Pack \" ) , including Tom Cruise , Rob Lowe , C. Thomas Howell , Emilio Estevez , Patrick Swayze , Mickey Rourke , Nicolas Cage , and Matt Dillon . Lane 's distinction among these heavily male casts advanced her career while affiliating her with this young generation of male actors . Andy Warhol proclaimed her , \" the undisputed female lead of Hollywood 's new rat pack . \" However , the two films that could have catapulted her to star status , Streets of Fire ( she turned down Splash and Risky Business for this film ) and The Cotton Club , were both commercial and critical failures , and her career languished as a result . After The Cotton Club , Lane dropped out of the movie business and lived with her mother in Georgia . According to the actress , \" I hadn 't been close to my mom for a long time , so we had a lot of homework to do . We had to repair our relationship because I wanted my mother back \" . Lane returned to acting to appear in The Big Town and Lady Beware , but Lane had not made another big impression on a sizable audience until 1989 's popular and critically acclaimed TV miniseries Lonesome Dove , and was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role . She came very close to being cast as Vivian Ward in 1990 's blockbuster hit Pretty Woman ( which had a much darker script at the time ) , but due to scheduling , was unable to take the role . Apparently , costume fittings were made for Lane , before the role fell to Julia Roberts . She was given positive reviews for her performance in the independent film My New Gun , which was well received at the Cannes Film Festival . She went on to appear as actress Paulette Goddard in Sir Richard Attenborough 's big-budget biopic of Charles Chaplin , 1992 's Chaplin . Lane won further praise for her role in 1999 's A Walk on the Moon , opposite Viggo Mortensen . One reviewer wrote , \" Lane , after years in post-teenaged-career limbo , is meltingly effective . \" The film 's director , Tony Goldwyn , described Lane as having \" ... this potentially volcanic sexuality that is in no way self-conscious or opportunistic . \" Lane earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead . At this time , she was interested in making a film about actress Jean Seberg in which she would play Seberg . = = = Recent work : From Unfaithful to the present = = = In 2000 , Lane had a supporting role as Mark Wahlberg 's love interest in The Perfect Storm . In 2002 , she starred in Unfaithful , a drama film directed by Adrian Lyne and adapted from the French film The Unfaithful Wife . Lane played a housewife who indulges in an adulterous fling with a mysterious book dealer . The film featured several sex scenes , and Lyne 's repeated takes for these scenes were very demanding for the actors involved , especially for Lane , who had to be emotionally and physically fit for the duration . Unfaithful received mostly mixed to negative reviews , though Lane earned widespread praise for her performance . Besides winning the Best Actress National Society of Film Critics Award and the New York Film Critics Circle Award , she also received Best Actress Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations . Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman stated that \" Lane , in the most urgent performance of her career , is a revelation . The play of lust , romance , degradation , and guilt on her face is the movie 's real story . \" Following Unfaithful , Lane starred in Under the Tuscan Sun , a film based on the best-selling book by Frances Mayes for which Lane won a further Best Actress Golden Globe nomination . This was followed by lead roles in Fierce People , Must Love Dogs , and Hollywoodland . In 2008 , Lane reunited with Richard Gere for the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe . It is the third film Gere and Lane filmed together , and is based on the novel of the same title by Nicholas Sparks . Lane also co-starred in Jumper and Untraceable in the same year . She then appeared in Killshot with Mickey Rourke , which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009 . While promoting Nights in Rodanthe , she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was \" gunning for something that 's not so sympathetic . I need to be a bitch , and I need to be in a comedy . I 've decided . No more Miss Nice Guy . \" Lane had even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles . She said in an interview , \" I can 't do anything official . My agents won 't let me . Between you and me , I don 't have anything else coming out . \" In 2010 , Lane starred in Secretariat , a Disney film about the relationship between the 1973 Triple Crown-winning racehorse and his owner , Penny Chenery , whom Lane portrayed . Lane then starred in Cinema Verite ( 2011 ) , an HBO movie about the making of the first reality television show An American Family . Lane earned Emmy , Screen Actors Guild , Satellite , and Golden Globe award nominations for her portrayal of Pat Loud . In 2012 , Lane was featured in the PBS documentary Half the Sky : Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide ( produced by Show of Force along with Fugitive Films ) , which showcased women and girls living under very difficult circumstances and bravely fighting to challenge them . Following the success of Cinema Verite , Lane starred in Zack Snyder 's Superman film Man of Steel , playing Martha Kent . Snyder said of her casting , \" We are thrilled to have Diane in the role because she can convey the wisdom and the wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination . \" She reprised her role in the sequel Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice ( 2016 ) . In 2015 , Lane appeared in the drama Every Secret Thing ( alongside Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Banks ) , had a voice role in the Pixar animated feature Inside Out , and co-starred in the biopic Trumbo ( opposite Bryan Cranston and Helen Mirren ) , which received a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Ensemble Cast .

Lane played Princess Kosmonopolis , a fading Hollywood movie star , opposite Finn Wittrock , who portrayed Chance , her attractive gigolo . This was the first time she had done a stage play since 1989 , when she played Olivia in William Shakespeare 's Twelfth Night at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge , Massachusetts . Lane returned to theatre in the winter of 2015 , starring with Tony Shaloub in the off-Broadway original production of Bathsheba Doran 's The Mystery of Love and Sex . Nearly four decades after she first appeared on Broadway , Lane will , in September 2016 , star in a play she previously performed in in 1977 : Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard . While Lane played a child peasant ( with no lines ) in Broadway 's 1977 run of the play , this time she will be playing the lead role of Madame Lyubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya . Forthcoming film roles include the lead in Eleanor Coppola 's Paris Can Wait ( formerly called Bonjour Anne ) , opposite Alec Baldwin . She will also star in Felt alongside Liam Neeson , a film about Mark Felt ( more famously known as Deep Throat ) , the whistleblower of the Watergate scandal . = = Personal life = = = = = Family = = = Lane met actor Christopher Lambert in Paris while promoting The Cotton Club in 1984 . They had a brief affair and split up . They met again two years later in Rome to make a film together , entitled After the Rain , and in two weeks they were a couple again .

Lane declined to press charges , however , and the couple 's spokesperson described the incident as a \" misunderstanding \" . Lane and Brolin filed for divorce in February 2013 . Their divorce was finalized on December 2 , 2013 . = = = Charity work = = = Lane is also involved in several charities , including Heifer International , which focuses on world hunger , and Artists for Peace and Justice , a Hollywood organization that supports Haiti relief . However , she tries not to draw attention to her humanitarian efforts : \" Sometimes I give with my heart . Sometimes I give financially , but there 's something about [ helping others ] that I think ought to be anonymous . I don 't want it to be a boastful thing . \" Lane was featured heavily in the documentary Half The Sky , based on the book Half the Sky : Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide . The documentary had Lane and several other A-list actresses / celebrities visit Africa and other areas where women are oppressed . Lane has become very much an ambassador for this kind of work and charity work in general . On August 22 , 2014 , Diane Lane was honored for her work with Heifer International at its third annual Beyond Hunger : A Place at the Table gala at the Montage Beverly Hills .

                    "text": "Ranveer Singh = Ranveer Singh Bhavnani ( born 6 July 1985 ) is an Indian film actor who appears in Hindi films . After completing a bachelor 's degree from Indiana University , Bloomington , Singh returned to India to pursue a career in film . He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films ' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat . The film emerged as a critical and commercial success , earning Singh a Filmfare Award in the Best Male Debut category . Singh went on to star in the romantic drama Lootera ( 2013 ) , Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela ( 2013 ) , his biggest commercial successes to that point , and in the action-drama Gunday ( 2014 ) . In 2015 , he starred in the ensemble comedy-drama Dil Dhadakne Do ( 2015 ) , and portrayed Bajirao I in the historical romance Bajirao Mastani , one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films , for which he garnered critical acclaim and won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor . = = Early life and background = = Singh was born on 6 July 1985 into a Sindhi family to Anju and Jagjit Singh Bhavnani . His grandparents , Sunder Singh Bhavnani and Chand Burke , moved to Mumbai from Karachi , Sindh , during the Partition of India . He has an elder sister named Ritika Bhavnani . Singh is the maternal cousin of actress Sonam Kapoor and producer Rhea Kapoor , daughters of actor Anil Kapoor and wife Sunita Kapoor ( n\u00e9e Bhavnani ) . Singh explains that he dropped his surname Bhavnani , since he felt that the name would have been \" too long , too many syllables \" , thus downplaying his brand as a \" saleable commodity \" . Singh always aspired to be an actor , participating in several school plays and debates . Once when he had gone for a birthday party , his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her . Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song \" Chumma Chumma \" from the 1991 action film , Hum . He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing . However , after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai , Singh realised that getting a break in the film industry was not at all easy , as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities . Feeling that the idea of acting was \" too far-fetched \" , Singh focused on creative writing . He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University . At university , he decided to take acting classes and took up theatre as his minor . After completing his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007 , Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter , with agencies like O & M and J. Walter Thompson . He then worked as an assistant director , but left it to pursue acting . He decided to send his portfolio to directors . He would go for all kinds of auditions , but did not get any good opportunities , while only getting calls for minor roles : \" Everything was so bleak . It was very frustrating . There were times I would think whether I was doing the right thing or not . \" = = Career = = = = = Early work ( 2008 \u2013 11 ) = = = In January 2010 , Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma , the head of the casting division for Yash Raj Films . They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat , a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning . Aditya Chopra , the vice president of the company , later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh 's acting , and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma , the hero of the film . However , the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber . After the two weeks of testing , Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo , with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead . Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy . To prepare for the role , he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus . Prior to the release of the film , trade analysts were skeptical of the film 's commercial potential , citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films ' last few productions , the lack of a male star and the fact that the female lead , Anushka Sharma , was by then an \" almost-forgotten \" actress . However , Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit . Singh 's portrayal of Bittoo was praised , with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was \" pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who is a bit of a duffer when it comes to matters of the heart . The film earned approximately \u20b9 214 million ( US $ 3.2 million ) at the domestic box office . At the 56th Filmfare Awards , Singh won the award for Best Male Debut . Following Band Baaja Baarat , Singh signed on for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl , a romantic comedy produced by Chopra and directed by Maneesh Sharma . He played a conman Ricky Bahl who cons girls for a living but finally meets his match . The film co-starred Anushka Sharma , Parineeti Chopra , Dipannita Sharma and Aditi Sharma . According to Singh , the title character had various avatars in the film , including a chirpy , entertaining side and a sinister side . Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote , \" Ranveer is , well Ranveer : your average Joe kind of hero who looks convincing enough as Sunny , Deven , Iqbal , Ricky , his sundry avatars . \" Commercially , Ladies vs Ricky Bahl earned \u20b9 370 million ( US $ 5.5 million ) domestically . = = = Success ( 2013 \u2013 present ) = = = Singh 's next release was Lootera ( 2013 ) , a period romance , written and directed by Vikramaditya Motwane , and co-starring Sonakshi Sinha . An adaptation of O. Henry 's short story The Last Leaf , Lootera was critically acclaimed . Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote that Singh \" brings a quiet sensitivity to Varun , and occasionally a smoldering intensity . Offering a finely internalized performance , he leaves a lasting impression . \" However , Lootera performed poorly at the box office . Singh next starred opposite Deepika Padukone in Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's adaptation of William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet , entitled Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela , in which he played Ram , a Gujarati boy based on the character of Romeo . Bhansali was impressed by Singh 's performance in Band Baaja Baaraat and decided to cast him for the film . Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela generated positive reviews from critics , as did Singh 's performance . Writing for India Today , Rohit Khilnani commented that \" Singh has everything going for him here . His Bollywood hero entry scene lying down on a bike in the song ' Tattad Tattad ' is outstanding . He learnt a new language to better his performance for the character Ram and it paid off . In his fourth film he has the presence of a star . \" The film emerged as Singh 's biggest commercial success , with worldwide revenues of \u20b9 2.02 billion ( US $ 30 million ) . For his portrayal , he received several recognitions , including a Best Actor nomination at Filmfare . In 2014 , Singh starred as a Bengali criminal in Ali Abbas Zafar 's Gunday , alongside Arjun Kapoor , Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan . David Chute of Variety praised Singh 's screen presence and wrote that he \" tucks the movie 's center of interest under his arm and takes it with him \u2014 even though he has the could-be-thankless \" good brother \" role \" . Also , Singh 's chemistry with Kapoor was considered by critic Rohit Khilnani to the prime asset of the film . Gunday proved to be Singh 's biggest box office opener , and eventually emerged a box-office success with a revenue of \u20b9 1 billion ( US $ 15 million ) worldwide . After a cameo appearance in Finding Fanny , Singh starred as a gangster in Shaad Ali 's unsuccessful crime drama Kill Dil opposite Parineeti Chopra and Ali Zafar and received negative reviews . In Zoya Akhtar 's ensemble comedy-drama Dil Dhadakne Do ( 2015 ) , Singh starred with Anil Kapoor , Shefali Shah and Priyanka Chopra as the younger sibling of a dysfunctional Punjabi family . Writing for Mumbai Mirror , critic Kunal Guha found Singh to be the \" surprise element \" of the film ; he praised his \" immaculate comic timing \" and particularly noted on the subtelty of his performance . The film further was an economic success , grossing \u20b9 1.47 billion ( US $ 22 million ) worldwide within seventeen days of release . Singh next reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali for the epic romance Bajirao Mastani ( 2015 ) opposite Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra . He portrayed Bajirao I , for which he shaved his head and locked himself up in a hotel room for 21 days . Raja Sen in his review mentioned : \" Ranveer Singh brings his character to life and does so with both machismo and grace , his Peshwa Bajirao slicing down soldiers like a lehnga-clad golfer wielding a too-sharp niblick . The film was a box-office success and Singh won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor . As of July 2016 , Singh has completed work on Aditya Chopra 's romance Befikre in Paris , opposite Vaani Kapoor . In addition , he has committed to star in Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's Padmavati , a film based on Rani Padmavati , along with Deepika Padukone and an untitled Rohit Shetty film , co-starring Tamannaah . = = Filmography and awards = = = = = Filmography = = = = = = Awards and nominations = = = Singh is the recipient of two Filmfare Awards : Best Male Debut for Band Baaja Baaraat ( 2010 ) and Best Actor for Bajirao Mastani ( 2016 ) .

                    "text": "Steven Moffat = Steven William Moffat , OBE ( / \u02ccsti\u02d0v\u0259n \u02c8m\u0252f\u0259t / , born 18 November 1961 ) is a Scottish television writer and producer , known for his work as showrunner , writer and producer of the British television series Doctor Who and Sherlock . Moffat 's first television work was the teen drama series Press Gang . His first sitcom , Joking Apart , was inspired by the breakdown of his first marriage ; conversely , his later sitcom Coupling was based upon the development of his relationship with television producer Sue Vertue . In between the two relationship-centred shows , he wrote Chalk , a sitcom set in a comprehensive school inspired by his own experience as an English teacher . A lifelong fan of Doctor Who , Moffat 's first work on the series was the script of the parody episode The Curse of Fatal Death in 1999 . He then wrote six episodes of the revived series which began in 2005 ( \" The Empty Child \" , \" The Doctor Dances \" , \" The Girl in the Fireplace \" , \" Blink \" , \" Silence in the Library \" , and \" Forest of the Dead \" ) . In 2010 he replaced Russell T Davies as showrunner , lead writer and executive producer . The same year , he created Sherlock along with Mark Gatiss . In January 2016 , it was announced that Moffat would step down from being showrunner of Doctor Who after the spring 2017 season finale , and that Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall would take over . He also co-wrote Steven Spielberg 's The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn in 2011 . Moffat has won several awards , mainly for Doctor Who and Sherlock , including an Emmy Award , five BAFTA Awards and four Hugo Awards . = = Early life and Press Gang = = Moffat was born in Paisley , Scotland , where he attended Camphill High School . He studied at the University of Glasgow , where he was involved with the student television station , GUST ( Glasgow University Student Television ) . After gaining an MA degree in English from Glasgow , he worked as a teacher for three and a half years at Cowdenknowes High School , Greenock . In the 1980s he wrote a play entitled War Zones ( performed at the 1985 Glasgow Mayfest and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe ) and a musical called Knifer . His father , Bill Moffat , was a head teacher at Thorn Primary School in Johnstone , Renfrewshire ; when the school was used for Harry Secombe 's Highway in the late 1980s , he mentioned to the producers that he had an idea for a television series about a school newspaper . The producers asked for a sample script , to which Bill Moffat agreed on condition his son write it . Producer Sandra Hastie said that it was \" the best ever first script \" that she had read . The resulting series was titled Press Gang , starring Julia Sawalha and Dexter Fletcher , and ran for five series on ITV between 1989 and 1993 , with Moffat writing all forty-three episodes . The programme won a BAFTA award in its second series . During production of the second series of Press Gang , Moffat was experiencing an unhappy personal life as a result of the break-up of his first marriage . The producer was secretly phoning his friends at home to check on his state . His wife 's new lover was represented in the episode \" The Big Finish ? \" by the character Brian Magboy ( Simon Schatzberger ) , a name inspired by Brian : Maggie 's boy . Moffat brought in the character so that all sorts of unfortunate things would happen to him , such as having a typewriter dropped on his foot . = = Joking Apart = = By 1990 , Moffat had written two series of Press Gang , but the programme 's high cost along with organisational changes at backers Central Independent Television cast its future in doubt . As Moffat wondered what to do next and worried about his future employment , Bob Spiers , Press Gang 's primary director , suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom . Inspired by his experience working in education , Moffat 's initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk , a sitcom set in a school that eventually aired in 1997 . During the pitch meeting at the Groucho Club , Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking passionately about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead of a school sitcom . Taking Ptaszynski 's advice , Moffat 's new idea was about \" a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him \" . Moffat wrote two series of Joking Apart , which was directed by Bob Spiers , and starred Robert Bathurst and Fiona Gillies . The show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys . In an interview with Richard Herring , Moffat says that \" The sit-com actually lasted slightly longer than my marriage . \" Fiona Gillies , who played the adulteress Becky , says that she was aware that some of her dialogue was based on what had been said to Moffat during his own separation . Moffat recycled his own dialogue : when he had learned that his wife 's lover was a fan of Press Gang , he replied , \" Well , did he have to fuck my wife ? Most people just write in ! \" . The line , with the expletive replaced by \" shagged \" , was used in the first episode of Joking Apart . Speaking about the autobiographical elements of the show , the writer jokes that he has to remember that his wife didn 't leave him for an estate agent ; his wife was an estate agent . Conversely , his later sitcom Coupling was based on his relationship with his second wife , TV producer Sue Vertue . Moffat reused the surname \" Taylor \" , which is Mark 's surname in Joking Apart , for Jack Davenport 's character Steve in Coupling . He wrote three episodes of Murder Most Horrid , an anthology series of comedic tales starring Dawn French . The first ( \" Overkill \" , directed by Bob Spiers ) was identified by the BBC as a \" highlight \" of the series . His other two episodes were \" Dying Live \" ( dir . Dewi Humphreys ) and \" Elvis , Jesus and Zack \" ( dir . Tony Dow ) . = = Chalk and Coupling = = Between marriages , Moffat claims that he \" shagged [ his ] way round television studios like a mechanical digger . \" According to an interview with The New York Times , Moffat met television producer Sue Vertue at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1996 . Vertue had been working for Tiger Aspect , a production company run by Peter Bennett-Jones . Bennett-Jones and his friend and former colleague Andre Ptaszynski , who had worked with Moffat on Joking Apart , told Moffat and Vertue that each fancied the other . A relationship blossomed and they left their respective production companies to join Hartswood Films , run by Beryl Vertue , Sue 's mother . The couple have two children together : Joshua and Louis . Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood , Ptaszynski produced Chalk , the series that the writer had pitched to him at the beginning of the decade . Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis , the show was based on Moffat 's three years as an English teacher . The studio audience responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired . However , it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997 , who had taken exception to the BBC 's publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers . In an interview in the early 2000s , Moffat refuses to even name the series , joking that he might get attacked in the street . After production wrapped on Chalk in 1997 , Moffat announced to the cast that he was marrying Vertue . When she eventually asked him for a sitcom , he decided to base it around the evolution of their own relationship . Coupling was first broadcast on BBC2 in 2000 , with his wife producing for Hartswood Films . The series proved to be highly successful , running until 2004 and producing four series and twenty-eight episodes , all written by Moffat . He also wrote the original , unbroadcast pilot episode for the U.S. version , also titled Coupling , although this was less successful and was cancelled after four episodes on the NBC network . Moffat has blamed its failure on an unprecedented level of network interference . = = Jekyll , Tintin , and Sherlock = = He wrote the Hartswood Films drama series Jekyll , a modern version of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , which aired on BBC One in June and July 2007 . In an interview with The Age , James Nesbitt , who played the eponymous character , called Moffat \" an eccentric , shy fellow \" , while commending his writing as \" inventive and dark and funny \" . In June 2007 Moffat told The Stage that he was working on a new sitcom . Provisionally titled Adam and Eve , it concerned a boss and his personal assistant , who are long-term friends but never get together . In October 2007 it was reported that Moffat would be scripting a trilogy of The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn films for directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson . According to The Times newspaper , Moffat had to be \" love bombed \" by Spielberg into accepting the offer to write the films , with the director promising to shield him from studio interference with his writing . He had intended to complete work on the whole trilogy before resuming work on Doctor Who , but the intervening WGA strike meant he could submit a finished script for the first film only . In July 2008 , Moffat was quoted by the Daily Mail as saying : \" I could not work on the second Tintin film and work on Doctor Who . So I chose Doctor Who . \" Moffat says that Spielberg was \" lovely \" about his decision . The script was completed by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish , with a part of Moffat 's script used in the film . Moffat remains a writer for Hartswood Films even after his appointment as show-runner for Doctor Who . During their journeys from London to Cardiff for Doctor Who , Moffat and Mark Gatiss conceived a contemporary update of Sherlock Holmes , called Sherlock . Benedict Cumberbatch was cast as Holmes , with Martin Freeman as Dr Watson . A 60-minute pilot , written by Moffat , was filmed in January 2009 . The pilot was not broadcast , but three 90-minute episodes were commissioned . Moffat wrote the first of these , \" A Study in Pink \" , which was broadcast on 25 July 2010 on BBC One and BBC HD . A second series was broadcast in January 2012 , for which Moffat wrote the episode \" A Scandal in Belgravia \" , with a third following in January 2014 . = = Doctor Who = = Moffat has been a fan of Doctor Who since childhood . In 1995 , he contributed a segment to Paul Cornell 's Virgin New Adventures novel Human Nature . His first solo Doctor Who work was a short story , \" Continuity Errors \" , published in the 1996 Virgin Books anthology Decalog 3 : Consequences . In 1999 he scripted the parody Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death , which aired as part of Comic Relief 's Red Nose Day charity telethon . The co-producer for that year 's Comic Relief telethon was Moffat 's then-new wife , Sue Vertue . In 2004 , Moffat was signed to write for the revival of Doctor Who . He became known , according to The Guardian , for writing \" the clever , darker episodes \" of the first four series of the show . His contribution for the 2005 series was the two-part story \" The Empty Child \" / \" The Doctor Dances \" . In the DVD audio commentary he says that he waited forty years to see his name appear on top of that theme music . He wrote an episode for each of the two following series : \" The Girl in the Fireplace \" in the 2006 series and \" Blink \" in the 2007 series . Moffat won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form three years in a row for his contributions . \" The Girl in the Fireplace \" and \" Blink \" were both nominated for Nebula Awards . \" Blink \" also gained him the BAFTA Craft Award for Best Writer , and a BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Screenwriter . In the Doctor Who Magazine reader poll for the 2007 series , Moffat was voted as best writer and \" Blink \" as the best story . He also wrote the 2007 Children in Need \" special scene \" \" Time Crash \" . He wrote a two-part story for series four in 2008 , titled \" Silence in the Library \" / \" Forest of the Dead \" , making Moffat and series executive producer Russell T Davies the only writers to have contributed scripts to the first four series of the revived show . In March 2008 , Davies said that he often rewrote scripts from other writers , but didn 't \" touch a word \" of Moffat 's episodes . Moffat 's script for series four secured him his fourth consecutive Hugo Awards nomination , though it did not win . The BBC announced in May 2008 that Moffat would be taking over from Russell T Davies as head writer and executive producer for the revived show 's fifth series , to be broadcast in 2010 , although Davies had initiated discussions with Moffat regarding this as far back as July 2007 . Commenting on his appointment , Moffat said it was \" the proper duty of every British subject to come to the aid of the TARDIS \" . Production on Moffat 's time in charge of the programme began in July 2009 . As executive producer and head writer , he was significantly involved in casting Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor . Smith first appeared as the Doctor at the end of Davies and David Tennant 's final episode , the second part of The End of Time , in a short post-regeneration scene that Davies left for Moffat to write himself . Moffat wrote the scene in \" about ten minutes \" as \" a bit of fun banter \" for the new Doctor . In addition to his television episodes , Moffat has also contributed stories to Panini Publishing 's Doctor Who Storybook series , penning the short stories \" What I Did on My Christmas Holidays By Sally Sparrow \" for the 2006 book ( which later formed the basis of his TV episode \" Blink \" ) , \" Corner of the Eye \" for the 2007 volume and \" A Letter From the Doctor \" which opens the 2009 Storybook . In June 2015 , Moffat was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to drama . = = Writing credits = = = = Awards and nominations = =",

                    "text": "Hair ( musical ) = Hair : The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical is a rock musical with a book and lyrics by James Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot . A product of the hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the 1960s , several of its songs became anthems of the anti-Vietnam War peace movement . The musical 's profanity , its depiction of the use of illegal drugs , its treatment of sexuality , its irreverence for the American flag , and its nude scene caused much comment and controversy . The musical broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of \" rock musical \" , using a racially integrated cast , and inviting the audience onstage for a \" Be-In \" finale . Hair tells the story of the \" tribe \" , a group of politically active , long-haired hippies of the \" Age of Aquarius \" living a bohemian life in New York City and fighting against conscription into the Vietnam War . Claude , his good friend Berger , their roommate Sheila and their friends struggle to balance their young lives , loves , and the sexual revolution with their rebellion against the war and their conservative parents and society . Ultimately , Claude must decide whether to resist the draft as his friends have done , or to succumb to the pressures of his parents ( and conservative America ) to serve in Vietnam , compromising his pacifistic principles and risking his life . After an off-Broadway debut in October 1967 at Joseph Papp 's Public Theater and a subsequent run at the Cheetah nightclub from December 1967 through January 1968 , the show opened on Broadway in April 1968 and ran for 1,750 performances . Simultaneous productions in cities across the United States and Europe followed shortly thereafter , including a successful London production that ran for 1,997 performances . Since then , numerous productions have been staged around the world , spawning dozens of recordings of the musical , including the 3 million-selling original Broadway cast recording . Some of the songs from its score became Top 10 hits , and a feature film adaptation was released in 1979 . A Broadway revival opened on March 31 , 2009 , earning strong reviews and winning the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for best revival of a musical . In 2008 , Time magazine wrote , \" Today Hair seems , if anything , more daring than ever . \" = = History = = Hair was conceived by actors James Rado and Gerome Ragni . The two met in 1964 when they performed together in the Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die , and they began writing Hair together in late 1964 . The main characters were autobiographical , with Rado 's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni 's Berger an extrovert . Their close relationship , including its volatility , was reflected in the musical . Rado explained , \" We were great friends . It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity , into writing , into creating this piece . We put the drama between us on stage . \" Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \" a combination of some characters we met in the streets , people we knew and our own imaginations . We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft , and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long \" . He recalled , \" There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas , and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful .... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [ and ] let our hair grow . \" Many cast members ( Shelley Plimpton in particular ) were recruited right off the street . Rado said , \" It was very important historically , and if we hadn 't written it , there 'd not be any examples . You could read about it and see film clips , but you 'd never experience it . We thought , ' This is happening in the streets , ' and we wanted to bring it to the stage . \" Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds . In college , Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition . He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg . Ragni , on the other hand , was an active member of The Open Theater , one of several groups , mostly Off-off Broadway , that were developing experimental theatre techniques . He introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater . In 1966 , while the two were developing Hair , Ragni performed in The Open Theater 's production of Megan Terry 's play , Viet Rock , a story about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War . In addition to the war theme , Viet Rock employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of Hair . Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who , through common friend Nat Shapiro , connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot . MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition \" African Waltz \" ( recorded by Cannonball Adderley ) . The composer 's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators : \" I had short hair , a wife , and , at that point , four children , and I lived on Staten Island . \" \" I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni . \" But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show . \" We work independently , \" explained MacDermot in May 1968 . \" I prefer it that way . They hand me the material . I set it to music . \" MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks , starting with the songs \" I Got Life \" , \" Ain 't Got No \" , \" Where Do I Go \" and the title song . He first wrote \" Aquarius \" as an unconventional art piece , but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem . = = = Off-Broadway productions = = = The creators pitched the show to Broadway producers and received many rejections . Eventually Joe Papp , who ran the New York Shakespeare Festival , decided he wanted Hair to open the new Public Theater ( still under construction ) in New York City 's East Village . The musical was Papp 's first non-Shakespeare offering . The production did not go smoothly : \" The rehearsal and casting process was confused , the material itself incomprehensible to many of the theater \u2019 s staff . The director , Gerald Freedman , the theater 's associate artistic director , withdrew in frustration during the final week of rehearsals and offered his resignation . Papp accepted it , and the choreographer Anna Sokolow took over the show .... After a disastrous final dress rehearsal , Papp wired Mr. Freedman in Washington , where he 'd fled : ' Please come back . ' Mr. Freedman did . \" Hair premiered off-Broadway at the Public on October 17 , 1967 and ran for a limited engagement of six weeks . The lead roles were played by Walker Daniels as Claude , Ragni as Berger , Jill O 'Hara as Sheila , Steve Dean as Woof , Arnold Wilkerson as Hud , Sally Eaton as Jeanie and Shelley Plimpton as Crissy . Set design was by Ming Cho Lee , costume design by Theoni Aldredge , and although Anna Sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer , Freedman received choreographer credit . Although the production had a \" tepid critical reception \" , it was popular with audiences . A cast album was released in 1967 . Chicago businessman Michael Butler was planning to run for the U.S. Senate on an anti-war platform . After seeing an ad for Hair in The New York Times that led him to believe the show was about Native Americans , he watched the Public 's production several times and joined forces with Joe Papp to reproduce the show at another New York venue after the close of its run at the Public . Papp and Butler first moved the show to The Cheetah , a discoth\u00e8que at 53rd Street and Broadway . It opened there on December 22 , 1967 and ran for 45 performances . There was no nudity in either the Public Theater or Cheetah production . = = = Revision for Broadway = = = Hair underwent a thorough overhaul between its closing at the Cheetah in January 1968 and its Broadway opening three months later . The off-Broadway book , already light on plot , was loosened even further and made more realistic . For example , Claude had been written as a space alien who aspires to be a cinematic director ; he became human for the Broadway version . Moreover , 13 new songs were added . The song \" Let the Sun Shine In \" was added so that the ending would be more uplifting . Before the move to Broadway , the creative team hired director Tom O 'Horgan , who had built a reputation directing experimental theater at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club . He had been the authors ' first choice to direct the Public Theater production , but he was in Europe at the time . Newsweek described O 'Horgan 's directing style as \" sensual , savage , and thoroughly musical ... [ he ] disintegrates verbal structure and often breaks up and distributes narrative and even character among different actors .... He enjoys sensory bombardment . \" In rehearsals , O 'Horgan used techniques passed down by Viola Spolin and Paul Sills involving role playing and improvisational \" games \" . Many of the improvisations tried during this process were incorporated into the Broadway script . O 'Horgan and new choreographer Julie Arenal encouraged freedom and spontaneity in their actors , introducing \" an organic , expansive style of staging \" that had never been seen before on Broadway . The inspiration to include nudity came when the authors saw an anti-war demonstration in Central Park where two men stripped naked as an expression of defiance and freedom , and they decided to incorporate the idea into the show . O 'Horgan had used nudity in many of the plays he directed , and he helped integrate the idea into the fabric of the show . Papp declined to pursue a Broadway production , and so Butler produced the show himself . For a time it seemed that Butler would be unable to secure a Broadway theater , as the Shuberts , Nederlanders and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial . However , Butler had family connections and knew important people ; he persuaded Biltmore Theatre owner David Cogan to make his venue available . = = Synopsis = = Act I Claude , the nominal leader of the \" tribe \" , sits center stage as the tribe mingles with the audience . Tribe members Sheila , a New York University student who is a determined political activist , and Berger , an irreverent free spirit , cut a lock of Claude 's hair and burn it in a receptacle . After the tribe converges in slow-motion toward the stage , through the audience , they begin their celebration as children of the Age of Aquarius ( \" Aquarius \" ) . Berger removes his trousers to reveal a loincloth . Interacting with the audience , he introduces himself as a \" psychedelic teddy bear \" and reveals that he is \" looking for my Donna \" ( \" Donna \" ) . The tribe recites a list of pharmaceuticals , legal and illegal ( \" Hashish \" ) . Woof , a gentle soul , extols several sexual practices ( \" Sodomy \" ) and says , \" I grow things . \" He loves plants , his family and the audience , telling the audience , \" We are all one . \" Hud , a militant African-American , is carried in upside down on a pole . He declares himself \" president of the United States of Love \" ( \" Colored Spade \" ) . In a fake English accent , Claude says that he is \" the most beautiful beast in the forest \" from \" Manchester , England \" . A tribe member reminds him that he 's really from Flushing , New York . Hud , Woof and Berger declare what color they are ( \" I 'm Black \" ) , while Claude says that he 's \" invisible \" . The tribe recites a list of things they lack ( \" Ain 't Got No \" ) . Four African-American tribe members recite street signs in symbolic sequence ( \" Dead End \" ) . Sheila is carried onstage ( \" I Believe in Love \" ) and leads the tribe in a protest chant . The tribe reprises \" Ain 't Got No ( Grass ) \" . Jeanie , an eccentric young woman , appears wearing a gas mask , satirizing pollution ( \" Air \" ) . She is pregnant and in love with Claude . Although she wishes it was Claude 's baby , she was \" knocked up by some crazy speed freak \" . The tribe link together LBJ ( President Lyndon B. Johnson ) , FBI ( the Federal Bureau of Investigation ) , CIA ( the Central Intelligence Agency ) and LSD ( \" Initials \" ) . Six members of the tribe appear dressed as Claude 's parents , berating him for his various transgressions \u2013 he does not have a job , and he collects \" mountains of paper \" clippings and notes . They say that they will not give him any more money , and \" the army 'll make a man out of you \" . In defiance , Claude leads the tribe in celebrating their vitality ( \" I Got Life \" ) . After handing out imaginary pills to the tribe members , saying the pills are for high-profile people such as Richard Nixon , the Pope , and \" Alabama Wallace \" , Berger relates how he was expelled from high school ( \" Goin ' Down \" ) . Claude returns from his draft board physical , which he passed . He pretends to burn his Vietnam War draft card , which Berger reveals as a library card . Claude agonizes about what to do about being drafted . Two tribe members dressed as tourists come down the aisle to ask the tribe why they have such long hair . In answer , Claude and Berger lead the tribe in explaining the significance of their \" Hair \" . The tourist lady states that kids should \" be free , no guilt \" and should \" do whatever you want , just so long as you don 't hurt anyone . \" She observes that long hair is natural , like the \" elegant plumage \" of male birds ( \" My Conviction \" ) . She opens her coat to reveal that she 's a man in drag . As the couple leaves , the tribe calls her Margaret Mead . Sheila gives Berger a yellow shirt . He goofs around and ends up tearing it in two . Sheila voices her distress that Berger seems to care more about the \" bleeding crowd \" than about her ( \" Easy to Be Hard \" ) . Jeanie summarizes everyone 's romantic entanglements : \" I 'm hung up on Claude , Sheila 's hung up on Berger , Berger is hung up everywhere . Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger . \" The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In . Berger , Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it ( \" Don 't Put it Down \" ) . After young and innocent Crissy describes \" Frank Mills \" , a boy she 's looking for , the tribe participates in the \" Be-In \" . The men of the tribe burn their draft cards . Claude puts his card in the fire , then changes his mind and pulls it out . He asks , \" where is the something , where is the someone , that tells me why I live and die ? \" ( \" Where Do I Go \" ) . The tribe emerges naked , intoning \" beads , flowers , freedom , happiness . \" Act II Four tribe members have the \" Electric Blues \" . After a black-out , the tribe enters worshiping \" Oh Great God of Power . \" Claude returns from the induction center , and tribe members act out an imagined conversation from Claude 's draft interview , with Hud saying \" the draft is white people sending black people to make war on the yellow people to defend the land they stole from the red people \" . Claude gives Woof a Mick Jagger poster , and Woof is excited about the gift , as he has said he 's hung up on Jagger . Three white women of the tribe tell why they like \" Black Boys \" ( \" black boys are delicious ... \" ) , and three black women of the tribe , dressed like The Supremes , explain why they like \" White Boys \" ( \" white boys are so pretty ... \" ) . Berger gives a joint to Claude that is laced with a hallucinogen . Claude starts to trip as the tribe acts out his visions ( \" Walking in Space \" ) . He hallucinates that he is skydiving from a plane into the jungles of Vietnam . Berger appears as General George Washington and is told to retreat because of an Indian attack . The Indians shoot all of Washington 's men . General Ulysses S. Grant appears and begins a roll call : Abraham Lincoln ( played by a black female tribe member ) , John Wilkes Booth , Calvin Coolidge , Clark Gable , Scarlett O 'Hara , Aretha Franklin , Colonel George Custer . Claude Bukowski is called in the roll call , but Clark Gable says \" he couldn 't make it \" . They all dance a minuet until three African witch doctors kill them \u2013 all except for Abraham Lincoln who says , \" I 'm one of you \" . Lincoln , after the three Africans sing his praises , recites an alternate version of the Gettysburg Address ( \" Abie Baby \" ) . Booth shoots Lincoln , but Lincoln says to him , \" I ain 't dying for no white man \" . As the visions continue , four Buddhist monks enter . One monk pours a can of gasoline over another monk , who is set afire ( reminiscent of the self-immolation of Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c ) and runs off screaming . Three Catholic nuns strangle the three remaining Buddhist monks . Three astronauts shoot the nuns with ray guns . Three Chinese people stab the astronauts with knives . Three Native Americans kill the Chinese with bows and tomahawks . Three green berets kill the Native Americans with machine guns and then kill each other . A Sergeant and two parents appear holding up a suit on a hanger . The parents talk to the suit as if it is their son and they are very proud of him . The bodies rise and play like children . The play escalates to violence until they are all dead again . They rise again ( \" Three-Five-Zero-Zero \" ) and , at the end of the trip sequence , two tribe members sing , over the dead bodies , a melody set to a Shakespeare lyric about the nobility of Man ( \" What A Piece of Work Is Man \" ) . After the trip , Claude says \" I can 't take this moment to moment living on the streets .... I know what I want to be ... invisible \" . As they \" look at the moon , \" Sheila and the others enjoy a light moment ( \" Good Morning Starshine \" ) . The tribe pays tribute to an old mattress ( \" The Bed \" ) . Claude is left alone with his doubts . He leaves as the tribe enters wrapped in blankets in the midst of a snow storm . They start a protest chant and then wonder where Claude has gone . Berger calls out \" Claude ! Claude ! \" Claude enters dressed in a military uniform , his hair short , but they do not see him because he is an invisible spirit . Claude says , \" like it or not , they got me . \" Claude and everyone sing \" Flesh Failures \" . The tribe moves in front of Claude as Sheila and Dionne take up the lyric . The whole tribe launches into \" Let the Sun Shine In \" , and as they exit , they reveal Claude lying down center stage on a black cloth . During the curtain call , the tribe reprises \" Let the Sun Shine In \" and brings audience members up on stage to dance . ( Note : This plot summary is based on the original Broadway script .

The production was directed by Tom O 'Horgan and choreographed by Julie Arenal , with set design by Robin Wagner , costume design by Nancy Potts , and lighting design by Jules Fisher . The original Broadway \" tribe \" ( i.e. , cast ) included authors Rado and Ragni , who played the lead roles of Claude and Berger , respectively , and Lynn Kellogg as Sheila , Lamont Washington as Hud , Sally Eaton and Shelley Plimpton reprising their off-Broadway roles as Jeanie and Crissy , Melba Moore as Dionne , Steve Curry as Woof , Ronnie Dyson ( who sang \" Aquarius \" ) , Paul Jabara and Diane Keaton ( both Moore and Keaton later played Sheila ) . Among the performers who appeared in Hair during its original Broadway run were Ben Vereen , Keith Carradine , Barry McGuire , Ted Lange , Meat Loaf , Kenny Seymour ( of Little Anthony and The Imperials ) , Joe Butler ( of the Lovin ' Spoonful ) , Peppy Castro ( of the Blues Magoos ) , Robin McNamara , Heather MacRae ( daughter of Gordon MacRae and Sheila MacRae ) , Eddie Rambeau , Vicki Sue Robinson , Beverly Bremers and Kim Milford . The Hair team soon became embroiled in a lawsuit with the organizers of the Tony Awards . After assuring producer Michael Butler that commencing previews by April 3 , 1968 would assure eligibility for consideration for the 1968 Tonys , the New York Theatre League ruled Hair ineligible , moving the cutoff date to March 19 . The producers brought suit but were unable to force the League to reconsider . At the 1969 Tonys , Hair was nominated for Best Musical and Best Director but lost out to 1776 in both categories . The production ran for four years and 1,750 performances , closing on July 1 , 1972 . = = = Early regional productions = = = The West Coast version played at the Aquarius Theater in Los Angeles beginning about six months after the Broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years . The Los Angeles tribe included Rado , Ragni , Robert Rothman , Ben Vereen ( who replaced Ragni ) , Red Shepard , Ted Neeley ( who replaced Rado ) , Meat Loaf , Gloria Jones , T\u00e1ta Vega , Jobriath , Jennifer Warnes , and Dobie Gray . There were soon nine simultaneous productions in U.S. cities , followed by national tours . Among the performers in these were Joe Mantegna , Andr\u00e9 DeShields , and Alaina Reed ( Chicago ) , David Lasley , David Patrick Kelly , Meat Loaf , and Shaun Murphy ( Detroit ) , Arnold McCuller ( tour ) , Bob Bingham ( Seattle ) and Philip Michael Thomas ( San Francisco ) . The creative team from Broadway worked on Hair in Los Angeles , Chicago and San Francisco , as the Broadway staging served as a rough template for these and other early regional productions . A notable addition to the team in Los Angeles was Tom Smothers , who served as co-producer . Regional casts consisted mostly of local actors , although a few Broadway cast members reprised their roles in other cities . O 'Horgan or the authors sometimes took new ideas and improvisations from a regional show and brought them back to New York , such as when live chickens were tossed onto the stage in Los Angeles . It was rare for so many productions to run simultaneously during an initial Broadway run . Producer Michael Butler , who had declared that Hair is \" the strongest anti-war statement ever written \" , said the reason that he opened so many productions was to influence public opinion against the Vietnam War and end it as soon as possible . = = = West End = = = Hair opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London on September 27 , 1968 , led by the same creative team as the Broadway production . The opening night was delayed until the abolition of theatre censorship in England under the Theatres Act 1968 so that the show could include nudity and profanity . As with other early productions , the London show added a sprinkling of local allusions and other minor departures from the Broadway version . The original London tribe included Sonja Kristina , Peter Straker , Paul Nicholas , Melba Moore , Elaine Paige , Paul Korda , Marsha Hunt , Floella Benjamin , Alex Harvey , Oliver Tobias , Richard O 'Brien and Tim Curry . This was Curry 's first full-time theatrical acting role , where he met future Rocky Horror Show collaborator O 'Brien . Hair 's engagement in London surpassed the Broadway production , running for 1,997 performances until its closure was forced by the roof of the theatre collapsing in July 1973 . = = = Early international productions = = = The job of leading the foreign language productions of Hair was given to Bertrand Castelli , Butler 's partner and executive producer of the Broadway show . Castelli was a writer / producer who traveled in Paris art circles and rubbed elbows with Pablo Picasso and Jean Cocteau . Butler described him as a \" crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads \" . Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English . The translations followed the original script closely , and the Broadway stagings were used . Each script contained local references , such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities . Castelli produced companies in France , Germany , Mexico and other countries , sometimes also directing the productions . A German production , directed by Castelli , opened in 1968 in Munich ; the tribe included Donna Summer , Liz Mitchell and Donna Wyant . A successful Parisian production of Hair opened on June 1 , 1969 . The original Australian production premiered in Sydney on June 6 , 1969 , produced by Harry M. Miller and directed by Jim Sharman , who also designed the production . The tribe included Keith Glass and then Reg Livermore as Berger , John Waters as Claude and Sharon Redd as The Magician . Redd was one of six African-Americans brought to Australia to provide a racially integrated tribe . The production broke local box-office records and ran for two years , but because of some of the language in the show , the cast album was banned in Queensland and New Zealand . The production transferred to Melbourne in 1971 and then had a national tour . It marked the stage debut of Boston-born Australian vocalist Marcia Hines . In Mexico the production was banned by the government after one night in Acapulco . An 18-year-old S\u00f4nia Braga appeared in the 1969 Brazilian production . Another notable production was in Belgrade , in the former Yugoslavia , in 1969 . It was the first Hair to be produced in a communist country . The show , translated into Serbian , was directed by female producer-director Mira Trailovi\u0107 at the Atelje 212 theatre . It featured Dragan Nikoli\u0107 , Branko Mili\u0107evi\u0107 , Seka Sabli\u0107 and Du\u0161an Prelevi\u0107 . Over four years , the production received 250 performances and was attended by president Tito . Local references in the script included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania , Yugoslavia 's traditional rival . By 1970 , Hair was a huge financial success , and nineteen productions had been staged outside of North America . In addition to those named above , these included productions in Scandinavia , South America , Italy , Israel , Japan , Canada , the Netherlands , Switzerland and Austria . According to Billboard , the various productions of the show were raking in almost $ 1 million every ten days , and royalties were being collected for 300 different recordings of the show 's songs , making it \" the most successful score in history as well as the most performed score ever written for the Broadway stage . \" = = Themes = = Hair explores many of the themes of the hippie movement of the 1960s . Theatre writer Scott Miller described these as follows : [ T ] he youth of America , especially those on college campuses , started protesting all the things that they saw wrong with America : racism , environmental destruction , poverty , sexism and sexual repression , violence at home and the war in Vietnam , depersonalization from new technologies , and corruption in politics . ... Contrary to popular opinion , the hippies had great respect for America and believed that they were the true patriots , the only ones who genuinely wanted to save our country and make it the best it could be once again . ... [ Long ] hair was the hippies ' flag \u2013 their ... symbol not only of rebellion but also of new possibilities , a symbol of the rejection of discrimination and restrictive gender roles ( a philosophy celebrated in the song \" My Conviction \" ) . It symbolized equality between men and women . ... [ T ] he hippies ' chosen clothing also made statements . Drab work clothes ( jeans , work shirts , pea coats ) were a rejection of materialism . Clothing from other cultures , particularly the Third World and native Americans , represented their awareness of the global community and their rejection of U.S. imperialism and selfishness . Simple cotton dresses and other natural fabrics were a rejection of synthetics , a return to natural things and simpler times . Some hippies wore old World War II or Civil War jackets as way of co-opting the symbols of war into their newfound philosophy of nonviolence . = = = Race and the tribe = = = Extending the precedents set by Show Boat ( 1927 ) and Porgy and Bess ( 1935 ) , Hair opened the Broadway musical to racial integration ; fully one-third of the cast was African American . Except for satirically in skits , the roles for the black members of the tribe portrayed them as equals , breaking away from the traditional roles for blacks in entertainment as slaves or servants . An Ebony magazine article declared that the show was the biggest outlet for black actors in the history of the U.S. stage . Several songs and scenes from the show address racial issues . \" Colored Spade \" , which introduces the character Hud , a militant black male , is a long list of racial slurs ( \" jungle bunny ... little black sambo \" ) topped off with the declaration that Hud is the \" president of the United States of love \" . At the end of his song , he tells the tribe that the \" boogie man \" will get them , as the tribe pretends to be frightened . \" Dead End \" , sung by black tribe members , is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation . One of the tribe 's protest chants is \" What do we think is really great ? To bomb , lynch and segregate ! \" \" Black Boys / White Boys \" is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation ; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967 . Another of the tribe 's protest chants is \" Black , white , yellow , red . Copulate in a king-sized bed . \" \" Abie Baby \" is part of the Act 2 \" trip \" sequence : four African witch doctors , who have just killed various American historical , cultural and fictional characters , sing the praises of Abraham Lincoln , portrayed by a black female tribe member , whom they decide not to kill . The first part of the song contains stereotypical language that black characters used in old movies , like \" I 's finished ... pluckin ' y 'all 's chickens \" and \" I 's free now thanks to y 'all , Master Lincoln \" . The Lincoln character then recites a modernized version of the Gettysburg Address , while a white female tribe member polishes Lincoln 's shoes with her blond hair . The many references to Native Americans throughout the script are part of the anti-consumerism , naturalism focus of the hippie movement and of Hair . The characters in the show are referred to as the \" tribe \" , borrowing the term for Native American communities . The cast of each production chooses a tribal name : \" The practice is not just cosmetic ... the entire cast must work together , must like each other , and often within the show , must work as a single organism . All the sense of family , of belonging , of responsibility and loyalty inherent in the word \" tribe \" has to be felt by the cast . \" To enhance this feeling , O 'Horgan put the cast through sensitivity exercises based on trust , touching , listening and intensive examination that broke down barriers between the cast and crew and encouraged bonding . These exercises were based on techniques developed at the Esalen Institute and Polish Lab Theater . The idea of Claude , Berger and Sheila living together is another facet of the 1960s concept of tribe . = = = Nudity , sexual freedom and drug use = = = The brief nude scene at the end of Act I was a subject of controversy and notoriety . Miller writes that \" nudity was a big part of the hippie culture , both as a rejection of the sexual repression of their parents and also as a statement about naturalism , spirituality , honesty , openness , and freedom . The naked body was beautiful , something to be celebrated and appreciated , not scorned and hidden . They saw their bodies and their sexuality as gifts , not as ' dirty ' things . \" Hair glorifies sexual freedom in a variety of ways . In addition to acceptance of miscegenation , mentioned above , the characters ' lifestyle acts as a sexually and politically charged updating of La boh\u00e8me ; as Rado explained , \" The love element of the peace movement was palpable . \" In the song \" Sodomy \" , Woof exhorts everyone to \" join the holy orgy Kama Sutra \" . Toward the end of Act 2 , the tribe members reveal their free love tendencies when they banter back and forth about who will sleep with whom that night . Woof has a crush on Mick Jagger , and a three-way embrace between Claude , Berger and Sheila turns into a Claude \u2013 Berger kiss . Various illegal drugs are taken by the characters during the course of the show , most notably a hallucinogen during the trip sequence . The song \" Walking in Space \" begins the sequence , and the lyrics celebrate the experience declaring \" how dare they try to end this beauty ... in this dive we rediscover sensation ... our eyes are open , wide , wide , wide \" . Similarly , in the song \" Donna \" , Berger sings that \" I 'm evolving through the drugs that you put down . \" At another point , Jeanie smokes marijuana and dismisses the critics of \" pot \" . Generally , the tribe favors hallucinogenic or \" mind expanding \" drugs , such as LSD and marijuana , while disapproving of other drugs such as speed and depressants . For example , Jeanie , after revealing that she is pregnant by a \" speed freak \" , says that \" methedrine is a bad scene \" . The song \" Hashish \" provides a list of pharmaceuticals , both illegal and legal , including cocaine , alcohol , LSD , opium and Thorazine , which is used as an antipsychotic . = = = Pacifism and environmentalism = = = The theme of opposition to the war that pervades the show is unified by the plot thread that progresses through the book \u2013 Claude 's moral dilemma over whether to burn his draft card . Pacifism is explored throughout the extended trip sequence in Act 2 . The lyrics to \" Three-Five-Zero-Zero \" , which is sung during that sequence , evoke the horrors of war ( \" ripped open by metal explosion \" ) . The song is based on Allen Ginsberg 's 1966 poem , \" Wichita Vortex Sutra \" . In the poem , General Maxwell Taylor proudly reports to the press the number of enemy soldiers killed in one month , repeating it digit by digit , for effect : \" Three-Five-Zero-Zero . \" The song begins with images of death and dying and turns into a manic dance number , echoing Maxwell 's glee at reporting the enemy casualties , as the tribe chants \" Take weapons up and begin to kill \" . The song also includes the repeated phrase \" Prisoners in niggertown / It 's a dirty little war \" . \" Don 't Put It Down \" satirizes the unexamined patriotism of people who are literally \" crazy \" for the American flag . \" Be In ( Hare Krishna ) \" praises the peace movement and events like the San Francisco and Central Park Be-Ins . Throughout the show , the tribe chants popular protest slogans like \" What do we want ? Peace ! \u2013 When do we want it ? Now ! \" and \" Do not enter the induction center \" . The upbeat song , \" Let the Sun Shine In \" , is a call to action , to reject the darkness of war and change the world for the better . Hair also aims its satire at the pollution caused by our civilization . Jeanie appears from a trap door in the stage wearing a gas mask and then sings the song \" Air \" : \" Welcome , sulfur dioxide . Hello carbon monoxide . The air ... is everywhere \" . She suggests that pollution will eventually kill her , \" vapor and fume at the stone of my tomb , breathing like a sullen perfume \" . In a comic , pro-green vein , when Woof introduces himself , he explains that he \" grows things \" like \" beets , and corn ... and sweet peas \" and that he \" loves the flowers and the fuzz and the trees \" . = = = Religion and astrology = = = Religion , particularly Catholicism , appears both overtly and symbolically throughout the piece , and it is often made the brunt of a joke . Berger sings of looking for \" my Donna \" , giving it the double meaning of the woman he 's searching for and the Madonna . During \" Sodomy \" , a hymn-like paean to all that is \" dirty \" about sex , the cast strikes evocative religious positions : the Piet\u00e0 and Christ on the cross . Before the song , Woof recites a modified rosary . In Act II , when Berger gives imaginary pills to various famous figures , he offers \" a pill for the Pope \" . In \" Going Down \" , after being kicked out of school , Berger compares himself to Lucifer : \" Just like the angel that fell / Banished forever to hell / Today have I been expelled / From high school heaven . \" Claude becomes a classic Christ figure at various points in the script . In Act I , Claude enters , saying , \" I am the Son of God . I shall vanish and be forgotten , \" then gives benediction to the tribe and the audience . Claude suffers from indecision , and , in his Gethsemane at the end of Act I , he asks \" Where Do I Go ? \" . There are textual allusions to Claude being on a cross , and , in the end , he is chosen to give his life for the others . Berger has been seen as a John the Baptist figure , preparing the way for Claude . Songs like \" Good Morning , Starshine \" and \" Aquarius \" reflect the 1960s cultural interest in astrological and cosmic concepts . \" Aquarius \" was the result of Rado 's research into his own astrological sign . The company 's astrologer , Maria Crummere , was consulted about casting : Sheila was usually played by a Libra or Capricorn and Berger by a Leo , although Ragni , the original Berger , was a Virgo . Crummere was also consulted when deciding when the show would open on Broadway and in other cities . The 1971 Broadway Playbill reported that she chose April 29 , 1968 for the Broadway premiere . \" The 29th was auspicious ... because the moon was high , indicating that people would attend in masses . The position of the ' history makers ' ( Pluto , Uranus , Jupiter ) in the 10th house made the show unique , powerful and a money-maker . And the fact that Neptune was on the ascendancy foretold that Hair would develop a reputation involving sex . \" In Mexico , where Crummere did not pick the opening date , the show was closed down by the government after one night . She was not pleased with the date of the Boston opening ( where the producers were sued over the show 's content ) saying , \" Jupiter will be in opposition to naughty Saturn , and the show opens the very day of the sun 's eclipse . Terrible . \" But there was no astrologically safe time in the near future . = = = Literary themes and symbolism = = = Hair makes many references to Shakespeare 's plays , especially Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet , and , at times , takes lyrical material directly from Shakespeare . For example , the lyrics to the song \" What a Piece of Work Is Man \" are from Hamlet ( II : scene 2 ) and portions of \" Flesh Failures \" ( \" the rest is silence \" ) are from Hamlet 's final lines . In \" Flesh Failures / Let The Sun Shine In \" , the lyrics \" Eyes , look your last ! / Arms , take your last embrace ! And lips , O you / The doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss \" are from Romeo and Juliet ( V : iii , 111 \u2013 14 ) . According to Miller , the Romeo suicide imagery makes the point that , with our complicity in war , we are killing ourselves . Symbolically , the running plot of Claude 's indecision , especially his resistance to burning his draft card , which ultimately causes his demise , has been seen as a parallel to Hamlet : \" the melancholy hippie \" . The symbolism is carried into the last scene , where Claude appears as a ghostly spirit among his friends wearing an army uniform in an ironic echo of an earlier scene , where he says , \" I know what I want to be ... invisible \" . According to Public Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis , \" Both [ Hair and Hamlet ] center on idealistic brilliant men as they struggle to find their place in a world marred by war , violence , and venal politics . They see both the luminous possibilities and the harshest realities of being human . In the end , unable to effectively combat the evil around them , they tragically succumb . \" Other literary references include the song \" Three-Five-Zero-Zero \" , based on Ginsberg 's poem \" Wichita Vortex Sutra \" , and , in the psychedelic drug trip sequence , the portrayal of Scarlett O 'Hara , from Gone with the Wind , and activist African-American poet LeRoi Jones . = = Dramatics = = In his introduction to the published script of Viet Rock , Richard Schechner says , \" performance , action , and event are the key terms of our theatre \u2013 and these terms are not literary . \" In the 1950s , Off-off Broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles , blurring the lines between playwright , director , and actor . The playwright 's job was not just to put words on a page , but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea . By 1967 , theaters such as The Living Theatre , La MaMa E.T.C. and The Open Theatre were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space , rather than following a traditional script . = = = Viet Rock and Hair = = = Megan Terry 's Viet Rock was created using this improvisational process . Scenes in Viet Rock were connected in \" prelogical ways \" : a scene could be built from a tangent from the scene before , it could be connected psychologically , or it could be in counterpoint to the previous scene . Actors were asked to switch roles in the middle of a show , and frequently in mid-scene . In her stage directions for a Senate hearing scene in Viet Rock , Terry wrote , \" The actors should take turns being senators and witnesses ; the transformations should be abrupt and total . When the actor is finished with one character he becomes another , or just an actor . \" Hair was designed in much the same way . Tom O 'Horgan , the show 's Broadway director , was intimately involved in the experimental theatre movement . In the transition to Broadway , O 'Horgan and the writers rearranged scenes to increase the experimental aspects of the show . Hair asks its actors to assume several different characters throughout the course of the piece , and , as in Claude 's psychedelic trip in Act 2 , sometimes during the same scene . Both Hair and Viet Rock include rock music , borrowed heavily from mass media , and frequently break down the invisible \" fourth wall \" to interact with the audience . For example , in the opening number , the tribe mingles with audience members , and at the end of the show , the audience is invited on stage . = = = Production design = = = In the original Broadway production , the stage was completely open , with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience . The proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding . Wagner 's spare set was painted in shades of grey with street graffiti stenciled on the stage . The stage was raked , and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree . This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast had gathered from the streets of New York . These included a life-size papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 bus driver , the head of Jesus , and a neon marquee of the Waverly movie theater in Greenwich Village . Potts ' costumes were based on hippie street clothes , made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture . Some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms , bell bottom jeans with Ukrainian embroidery , tie dyed T-shirts and a red white and blue fringed coat . Early productions were primarily reproductions of this basic design . = = = Nude scene = = = \" Much has been written about that scene ... most of it silly , \" wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity . The scene was inspired by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering . During \" Where Do I Go ? \" , the stage was covered in a giant scrim , beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes . At the musical cue , \" they [ stood ] naked and motionless , their bodies bathed in Fisher 's light projection of floral patterns . They chant [ ed ] of ' beads , flowers , freedom , and happiness . ' \" It lasted only twenty seconds . Indeed , the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny , during the interval at a London preview , to quip , \" Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish ? \" Nevertheless , the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places . It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes . Groucho Marx quipped , \" I was gonna go see it , and then I called up the theater . ... They said the tickets were $ 11 apiece . I told them I 'd call back , went into my bathroom , took off all my clothes , and looked at myself in the full-length mirror . Then I called the theater and said , ' Forget it . ' \" The nudity was optional for the performers . The French cast was \" the nudest \" of the foreign groups , while the London cast \" found nudity the hardest to achieve . \" The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe , but in Copenhagen , the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked up and down the aisle during the show 's prelude . In some early performances , the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled \" CENSORED \" . Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said , \" I was dead set against the nude scene at first , but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public . So I did it . \" According to Melba Moore , \" It doesn 't mean anything except what you want it to mean . We put so much value on clothing . .... It 's like so much else people get uptight about . \" Donna Summer , who was in the German production , said that \" it was not meant to be sexual . ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing . \" Rado said that \" being naked in front of an audience , you 're baring your soul . Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed . It was very apt , very honest and almost necessary . \" = = Music = = After studying the music of the Bantu at Cape Town University , MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of Hair . He listened to \" what [ the Bantu ] called quaylas ... [ which have a ] very characteristic beat , very similar to rock . Much deeper though .... Hair is very African \u2013 a lot of [ the ] rhythms , not the tunes so much . \" Quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables , and this influence can be heard in songs like \" What a Piece of Work Is Man \" and \" Ain 't Got No Grass \" . MacDermot said , \" My idea was to make a total funk show . They said they wanted rock & roll \u2013 but to me that translated to ' funk . ' \" That funk is evident throughout the score , notably in songs like \" Colored Spade \" and \" Walking in Space \" . MacDermot has claimed that the songs \" can 't all be the same . You 've got to get different styles .... I like to think they 're all a little different . \" As such , the music in Hair runs the gamut of rock : from the rockabilly sensibilities of \" Don 't Put it Down \" to the folk rock rhythms of \" Frank Mills \" and \" What a Piece of Work is Man \" . \" Easy to Be Hard \" is pure rhythm and blues , and protest rock anthems abound : \" Ain 't Got No \" and \" The Flesh Failures \" . The acid rock of \" Walking in Space \" and \" Aquarius \" are balanced by the mainstream pop of \" Good Morning Starshine \" . Scott Miller ties the music of Hair to the hippies ' political themes : \" The hippies ... were determined to create art of the people and their chosen art form , rock / folk music was by its definition , populist . ... [ T ] he hippies ' music was often very angry , its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution , who would sell America out , who would betray what America stood for ; in other words , directed at their parents and the government . \" Theatre historian John Kenrick explains the application of rock music to the medium of the stage : The same hard rock sound that had conquered the world of popular music made its way to the musical stage with two simultaneous hits \u2013 Your Own Thing [ and ] Hair .... This explosion of revolutionary proclamations , profanity and hard rock shook the musical theatre to its roots .... Most people in the theatre business were unwilling to look on Hair as anything more than a noisy accident . Tony voters tried to ignore Hair 's importance , shutting it out from any honors . However , some now insisted it was time for a change . New York Times critic Clive Barnes gushed that Hair was \" the first Broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday . \" The music did not resonate with everyone . Leonard Bernstein remarked \" the songs are just laundry lists \" and walked out of the production . Richard Rodgers could only hear the beat and called it \" one-third music \" . John Fogerty said , \" Hair is such a watered down version of what is really going on that I can \u2019 t get behind it at all . \" Gene Lees , writing for High Fidelity , claimed that John Lennon found it \" dull \" , and he wrote , \" I do not know any musician who thinks it 's good . \" = = = Songs = = = The score had many more songs than were typical of Broadway shows of the day . Most Broadway shows had about six to ten songs per act ; Hair 's total is in the thirties . This list reflects the most common Broadway lineup . The show was under almost perpetual re-write . Thirteen songs were added between the production at the Public Theater and Broadway , including \" I Believe in Love \" . \" The Climax \" and \" Dead End \" were cut between the productions , and \" Exanaplanetooch \" and \" You Are Standing on My Bed \" were present in previews but cut before Broadway . The Shakespearean speech \" What a piece of work is a man \" was originally spoken by Claude and musicalized by MacDermot for Broadway , and \" Hashish \" was formed from an early speech of Berger 's . Subsequent productions have included \" Hello There \" , \" Dead End \" , and \" Hippie Life \" \u2013 a song originally written for the film that Rado included in several productions in Europe in the 1990s . The 2009 Broadway revival included the ten-second \" Sheila Franklin \" and \" O Great God of Power \" , two songs that were cut from the original production . = = = Recordings = = = The first recording of Hair was made in 1967 featuring the off-Broadway cast . The original Broadway cast recording received a Grammy Award in 1968 for Best Score from an Original Cast Show Album and sold nearly 3 million copies in the U.S. by December 1969 . The New York Times noted in 2007 that \" The cast album of Hair was ... a must-have for the middle classes . Its exotic orange-and-green cover art imprinted itself instantly and indelibly on the psyche .... [ It ] became a pop-rock classic that , like all good pop , has an appeal that transcends particular tastes for genre or period . \" The 1993 London revival cast album contains new music that has been incorporated into the standard rental version . RCA Victor also released DisinHAIRited ( RCA Victor LSO-1163 ) : an album of songs that had been written for the show , but saw varying amounts of stage time . Some of the songs were cut between the Public and Broadway , some had been left off the original cast album due to space , and a few were never performed onstage . Songs from Hair have been recorded by numerous artists , including Shirley Bassey , Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross . \" Good Morning Starshine \" was sung on a 1969 episode of Sesame Street by cast member Bob McGrath , and versions by artists such as Sarah Brightman , Petula Clark , and Strawberry Alarm Clock have been recorded . Artists as varied as Liza Minnelli and The Lemonheads have recorded \" Frank Mills \" , and Andrea McArdle , Jennifer Warnes , and S\u00e9rgio Mendes have each contributed versions of \" Easy to Be Hard \" . Hair also helped launch recording careers for performers Meat Loaf , Dobie Gray , Jennifer Warnes , Jobriath , Bert Sommer , Ronnie Dyson , Donna Summer and Melba Moore , among others . The score of Hair saw chart successes , as well . The 5th Dimension released \" Aquarius / Let the Sunshine In \" in 1969 , which won Record of the Year in 1970 and topped the charts for six weeks . The Cowsills ' recording of the title song \" Hair \" climbed to # 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.while Oliver 's rendition of \" Good Morning Starshine \" reached # 3 . Three Dog Night 's version of \" Easy to Be Hard \" went to # 4 . Nina Simone 's 1968 medley of \" Ain 't Got No / I Got Life \" reached the top 5 on the British charts . In 1970 , ASCAP announced that \" Aquarius \" was played more frequently on U.S. radio and television than any other song that year . Productions in England , Germany , France , Sweden , Japan , Israel , the Netherlands , Australia and elsewhere released cast albums , and over 1,000 vocal and / or instrumental performances of individual songs from Hair have been recorded . Such broad attention was paid to the recordings of Hair that , after an unprecedented bidding war , ABC Records was willing to pay a record amount for MacDermot 's next Broadway adaptation Two Gentlemen of Verona . The 2009 revival recording , released on June 23 , debuted at # 1 on Billboard 's \" Top Cast Album \" chart and at # 63 in the Top 200 , qualifying it as the highest debuting album in Ghostlight Records history . = = Critical reception = = Reception to Hair upon its Broadway premiere was , with exceptions , overwhelmingly positive . Clive Barnes wrote in the New York Times : \" What is so likable about Hair ... ? I think it is simply that it is so likable . So new , so fresh , and so unassuming , even in its pretensions . \" John J. O 'Connor of The Wall Street Journal said the show was \" exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the Biltmore Theater \" . Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote that \" it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm , its high spirits are contagious , and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist . \" Television reviews were even more enthusiastic . Allan Jeffreys of ABC said the actors were \" the most talented hippies you 'll ever see ... directed in a wonderfully wild fashion by Tom O 'Horgan . \" Leonard Probst of NBC said \" Hair is the only new concept in musicals on Broadway in years and it 's more fun than any other this season \" . John Wingate of WOR TV praised MacDermot 's \" dynamic score \" that \" blasts and soars \" , and Len Harris of CBS said \" I 've finally found the best musical of the Broadway season ... it 's that sloppy , vulgar , terrific tribal love rock musical Hair . \" A reviewer from Variety , on the other hand , called the show \" loony \" and \" without a story , form , music , dancing , beauty or artistry .... It 's impossible to tell whether [ the cast has ] talent . Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business . \" Reviews in the news weeklies were mixed ; Jack Kroll in Newsweek wrote , \" There is no denying the sheer kinetic drive of this new Hair ... there is something hard , grabby , slightly corrupt about O 'Horgan 's virtuosity , like Busby Berkeley gone bitchy . \" But a reviewer from Time wrote that although the show \" thrums with vitality [ it is ] crippled by being a bookless musical and , like a boneless fish , it drifts when it should swim . \" Reviews were mixed when Hair opened in London . Irving Wardle in The Times wrote , \" Its honesty and passion give it the quality of a true theatrical celebration \u2013 the joyous sound of a group of people telling the world exactly what they feel . \" In The Financial Times , B. A. Young agreed that Hair was \" not only a wildly enjoyable evening , but a thoroughly moral one . \" However , in his final review before retiring after 48 years , 78-year-old W. A. Darlington of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he had \" tried hard \" , but found the evening \" a complete bore \u2013 noisy , ugly and quite desperately funny . \" Acknowledging the show 's critics , Scott Miller wrote in 2001 that \" some people can 't see past the appearance of chaos and randomness to the brilliant construction and sophisticated imagery underneath . \" Miller notes , \" Not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme , but many of the songs didn 't really have endings , just a slowing down and stopping , so the audience didn 't know when to applaud .... The show rejected every convention of Broadway , of traditional theatre in general , and of the American musical in specific . And it was brilliant . \" = = = Awards and nominations = = = = = Social change = = Hair challenged many of the norms held by Western society in 1968 . The name itself , inspired by the name of a Jim Dine painting depicting a comb and a few strands of hair , was a reaction to the restrictions of civilization and consumerism and a preference for naturalism . Rado remembers that long hair \" was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion . The longer the hair got , the more expansive the mind was . Long hair was shocking , and it was a revolutionary act to grow long hair . It was kind of a flag , really . \" The musical caused controversy when it was first staged . The Act I finale was the first time a Broadway show had seen totally naked actors and actresses , and the show was charged with the desecration of the American flag and the use of obscene language . These controversies , in addition to the anti \u2013 Vietnam War theme , attracted occasional threats and acts of violence during the show 's early years and became the basis for legal actions both when the show opened in other cities and on tour . Two cases eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court . = = = Legal challenges and violent reactions = = = The touring company of Hair met with resistance throughout the United States . In South Bend , Indiana , the Morris Civic Auditorium refused booking , and in Evansville , Indiana , the production was picketed by several church groups . In Indianapolis , Indiana , the producers had difficulty securing a theater , and city authorities suggested that the cast wear body stockings as a compromise to the city 's ordinance prohibiting publicly displayed nudity . Productions were frequently confronted with the closure of theaters by the fire marshal , as in Gladewater , Texas . Chattanooga 's 1972 refusal to allow the play to be shown at the city-owned Memorial Auditorium was later found by the U.S. Supreme Court to be an unlawful prior restraint . The legal challenges against the Boston production were appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court . The Chief of the Licensing Bureau took exception to the portrayal of the American flag in the piece , saying , \" anyone who desecrates the flag should be whipped on Boston Common . \" Although the scene was removed before opening , the District Attorney 's office began plans to stop the show , claiming that \" lewd and lascivious \" actions were taking place onstage . The Hair legal team obtained an injunction against criminal prosecution from the Superior Court , and the D.A. appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court . At the request of both parties , several of the justices viewed the production and handed down a ruling that \" each member of the cast [ must ] be clothed to a reasonable extent . \" The cast defiantly played the scene nude later that night , stating that the ruling was vague as to when it would take effect . The next day , April 10 , 1970 , the production closed , and movie houses , fearing the ruling on nudity , began excising scenes from films in their exhibition . After the Federal appellate bench reversed the Massachusetts court 's ruling , the D.A. appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court . In a 4 \u2013 4 decision , the Court upheld the lower court 's decision , allowing Hair to re-open on May 22 . In April 1971 , a bomb was thrown at the exterior of a theater in Cleveland , Ohio that had been housing a production , bouncing off the marquee and shattering windows in the building and in nearby storefronts . That same month , the families of cast member Jonathon Johnson and stage manager Rusty Carlson died in a fire in the Cleveland hotel where 33 members of the show 's troupe had been staying . The Sydney , Australia production 's opening night was interrupted by a bomb scare in June 1969 . = = = Worldwide reactions = = = Local reactions to the controversial material varied greatly . San Francisco 's large hippie population considered the show an extension of the street activities there , often blurring the barrier between art and life by meditating with the cast and frequently finding themselves onstage during the show . An 18-year-old Princess Anne was seen dancing onstage in London , and in Washington DC , Henry Kissinger attended . In St. Paul , Minnesota , a protesting clergyman released 18 white mice into the lobby hoping to frighten the audience . Capt. Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert , after dubbing Apollo 13 's lunar module \" Aquarius \" after the song , walked out of the production at the Biltmore in protest of perceived anti-Americanism and disrespect of the flag . An Acapulco , Mexico production of Hair , directed by Castelli , played in 1969 for one night . After the performance , the theater , located across the street from a popular local bordello , was padlocked by the government , which said the production was \" detrimental to the morals of youth . \" The cast was arrested soon after the performance and taken to Immigration , where they agreed to leave the country , but because of legal complications they were forced to go into hiding . They were expelled from Mexico days later . Hair effectively marked the end of stage censorship in the United Kingdom . London 's stage censor , the Lord Chamberlain , originally refused to license the musical , and the opening was delayed until Parliament passed a bill stripping him of his licensing power . In Munich , authorities threatened to close the production if the nude scene remained ; however , after a local Hair spokesman declared that his relatives had been marched nude into Auschwitz , the authorities relented . In Bergen , Norway , local citizens formed a human barricade to try to prevent the performance . The Parisian production encountered little controversy , and the cast disrobed for the nude scene \" almost religiously \" according to Castelli , nudity being common on stage in Paris . Even in Paris there was nevertheless occasional opposition , however , such as when a member of the local Salvation Army used a portable loud speaker to exhort the audience to halt the presentation . = = Beyond the 1960s = = = = = 1970s = = = A Broadway revival of Hair opened in 1977 for a run of 43 performances . It was produced by Butler , directed by O 'Horgan and performed in the Biltmore Theater , where the original Broadway production had played . The cast included Ellen Foley , Annie Golden , Cleavant Derricks and Kristen Vigard . Newcomer Peter Gallagher left the ensemble during previews to take the role of Danny Zuko in a tour of Grease . Reviews were generally negative , and critics accused the production of \" showing its gray \" . Few major revivals of Hair followed until the early 1990s . A movie version of Hair , with a screenplay by Michael Weller , was directed by Milo\u0161 Forman and released in 1979 . Filmed primarily in New York City 's Central Park and Washington Square Park , the cast includes Treat Williams , Beverly D 'Angelo , John Savage , Foley and Golden . Several of the songs were deleted , and the film 's storyline departs significantly from the musical . The character of Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma , newly arrived in New York to join the military , and Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye . In perhaps the greatest diversion from the stage version , a mistake leads Berger to go to Vietnam in Claude 's place , where he is killed . Rado and Ragni were unhappy with the film , feeling that Forman portrayed the hippies as \" oddballs \" and \" some sort of aberration \" without any connection to the peace movement , failing to capture the essence of the original stage production . They stated : \" Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version , other than some of the songs , the names of the characters , and a common title , eludes us . \" In their view , the screen version of Hair has not yet been produced . However , the film received generally favorable reviews . Writing in The New York Times , Vincent Canby called it \" a rollicking musical memoir .... Weller 's inventions make this Hair seem much funnier than I remember the show 's having been . They also provide time and space for the development of characters who , on the stage , had to express themselves almost entirely in song .... [ T ] he entire cast is superb .... Mostly ... the film is a delight . \" = = = 1980s and 1990s = = = A 20th anniversary concert event was held in May 1988 at the United Nations General Assembly to benefit children with AIDS . The event was sponsored by First Lady Nancy Reagan with Barbara Walters giving the night 's opening introduction . Rado , Ragni and MacDermot reunited to write nine new songs for the concert . The cast of 163 actors included former stars from various productions around the globe : Melba Moore , Ben Vereen , Treat Williams and Donna Summer , as well as guest performers Bea Arthur , Frank Stallone and Dr. Ruth Westheimer . Ticket prices ranged from $ 250 to $ 5,000 and the proceeds went to the United States Committee for UNICEF and the Creo Society 's Fund for Children with AIDS . A 1985 production of Hair mounted in Montreal was reportedly the 70th professional production of the musical . In November 1988 , Michael Butler produced Hair at Chicago 's Vic Theater to celebrate the shows ' 20th anniversary . The production was well received and ran until February 1989 . From 1990 to 1991 , Pink Lace Productions ran a U.S. national tour of Hair that included stops in South Carolina , Georgia , Tennessee and Kentucky . After Ragni died in 1991 , MacDermot and Rado continued to write new songs for revivals through the 1990s . Hair Sarajevo , AD 1992 was staged during the Siege of Sarajevo as an appeal for peace . Rado directed a $ 1 million , 11 city national tour in 1994 that featured actor Luther Creek . With MacDermot returning to oversee the music , Rado 's tour celebrated the show 's 25th anniversary . A small 1990 \" bus and truck \" production of Hair toured Europe for over 3 years , and Rado directed various European productions from 1995 to 1999 . A production opened in Australia in 1992 and a short-lived London revival starring John Barrowman and Paul Hipp opened at the Old Vic in London in 1993 , directed by Michael Bogdanov . While the London production was faithful to the original , a member of the production staff said the reason it \" flopped \" was because the tribe consisted of \" Thatcher 's children who didn 't really get it \" . Other productions were mounted around the world , including South Africa , where the show had been banned until the eradication of Apartheid . In 1996 , Butler brought a month-long production to Chicago , employing the Pacific Musical Theater , a professional troupe in residence at California State University , Fullerton . Butler ran the show concurrently with the 1996 Democratic National Convention , echoing the last time the DNC was in Chicago : 1968 . A 30th Anniversary Off-Off Broadway production was staged at Third Eye Repertory . It was directed by Shawn Rozsa . = = = 2000s and 2010s = = = In 2001 , the Reprise ! theatre company in Los Angeles performed Hair at the Wadsworth Theatre , starring Steven Weber as Berger , Sam Harris as Claude and Jennifer Leigh Warren as Sheila . That same year , Encores ! Great American Musicals in Concert ended its 2001 City Center season with a production of Hair starring Luther Creek , Idina Menzel and Tom Plotkin , and featuring Hair composer Galt MacDermot on stage playing the keyboards . An Actors ' Fund benefit of the show was performed for one night at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City in 2004 . The Tribe included Shoshana Bean , Raul Esparza , Jim J. Bullock , Liz Callaway , Gavin Creel , Eden Espinosa , Harvey Fierstein , Ana Gasteyer , Annie Golden , Jennifer Hudson , Julia Murney , Jai Rodriguez , RuPaul , Michael McKean , Laura Benanti and Adam Pascal . In 2005 , a London production opened at the Gate Theatre , directed by Daniel Kramer . James Rado approved an updating of the musical 's script to place it in the context of the Iraq War instead of the Vietnam War . Kramer 's modernized interpretation included \" Aquarius \" sung over a megaphone in Times Square , and nudity that called to mind images from Abu Ghraib . In March 2006 , Rado collaborated with director Robert Prior for a CanStage production of Hair in Toronto , and a revival produced by Pieter Toerien toured South Africa in 2007 . Directed by Paul Warwick Griffin , with choreography by Timothy Le Roux , the show ran at the Montecasino Theatre in Johannesburg and at Theatre on the Bay in Cape Town . A two-week run played at the Teatro Tapia in Old San Juan , Puerto Rico , in March 2010 , directed by Yinoelle Col\u00f3n . Michael Butler produced Hair at the MET Theatre in Los Angeles from September 14 through December 30 , 2007 . The show was directed and choreographed by Bo Crowell , with musical direction from Christian Nesmith ( son of Michael Nesmith ) . Butler 's production of Hair won the LA Weekly Theater Award for Musical of the Year . For three nights in September 2007 , Joe 's Pub and the Public Theater presented a 40th anniversary production of Hair at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park . This concert version , directed by Diane Paulus , featured Jonathan Groff as Claude and Galt MacDermot on stage on the keyboards . The cast also included Karen Olivo as Sheila and Will Swenson as Berger . Actors from the original Broadway production joined the cast on stage during the encore of \" Let the Sun Shine In . \" Demand for the show was overwhelming , as long lines and overnight waits for tickets far exceeded that for other Delacorte productions such as Mother Courage and Her Children starring Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline . Nine months later , The Public Theater presented a fully staged production of Hair at the Delacorte in a limited run from July 22 , 2008 to September 14 , 2008 . Paulus again directed , with choreography by Karole Armitage . Groff and Swenson returned as Claude and Berger , together with others from the concert cast . Caren Lyn Manuel played Sheila , and Christopher J. Hanke replaced Groff as Claude on August 17 . Reviews were generally positive , with Ben Brantley of The New York Times writing that \" this production establishes the show as more than a vivacious period piece . Hair , it seems , has deeper roots than anyone remembered \" . Time magazine wrote : \" Hair ... has been reinvigorated and reclaimed as one of the great milestones in musical-theatre history . ...

Paulus and Armitage again directed and choreographed , and most of the cast returned from the production in the park . A pre-performance ticket lottery was held nightly for $ 25 box-seat tickets . The opening cast included Gavin Creel as Claude , Will Swenson as Berger , Caissie Levy as Sheila , Megan Lawrence as Mom and Sasha Allen as Dionne . Designers included Scott Pask ( sets ) , Michael McDonald ( costumes ) and Kevin Adams ( lighting ) . Critical response was almost uniformly positive . The New York Daily News headline proclaimed \" Hair Revival 's High Fun \" . The review praised the daring direction , \" colorfully kinetic \" choreography and technical accomplishments of the show , especially the lighting , commening that \" as a smile-inducing celebration of life and freedom , [ Hair is ] highly communicable \" ; but warning : \" If you 're seated on the aisle , count on [ the cast ] to be in your face or your lap or ... braiding your tresses . \" The New York Post wrote that the production \" has emerged triumphant .... These days , the nation is fixated less on war and more on the economy . As a result , the scenes that resonate most are the ones in which the kids exultantly reject the rat race . \" Variety enthused , \" Director Diane Paulus and her prodigiously talented cast connect with the material in ways that cut right to the 1967 rock musical 's heart , generating tremendous energy that radiates to the rafters . ...

If this explosive production doesn 't stir something in you , it may be time to check your pulse . \" The Boston Globe dissented , saying that the production \" felt canned \" and \" overblown \" and that the revival \" feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib \" . Ben Brantley , writing for The New York Times , reflected the majority , however , delivering a glowing review : Having moved indoors to Broadway from the Delacorte Theater ... the young cast members ... show no signs of becoming domesticated . On the contrary , they \u2019 re tearing down the house . ... This emotionally rich revival ... delivers what Broadway otherwise hasn 't felt this season : the intense , unadulterated joy and anguish of that bi-polar state called youth . ... Karole Armitage 's happy hippie choreography , with its group gropes and mass writhing , looks as if it 's being invented on the spot . But there 's intelligent form within the seeming formlessness . ... [ Paulus finds ] depths of character and feeling in [ the 1968 show about kids ] frightened of how the future is going to change them and of not knowing what comes next . ... Every single ensemble member emerges as an individual . ... After the show I couldn \u2019 t stop thinking about what would happen to [ the characters ] . Mr. MacDermot 's music , which always had more pop than acid , holds up beautifully , given infectious life by the onstage band and the flavorfully blended voices of the cast . The Public Theater struggled to raise the $ 5.5 million budgeted for the Broadway transfer , because of the severity of the economic recession in late 2008 , but it reached its goal by adding new producing partners . Director Diane Paulus helped keep costs low by using an inexpensive set . The show grossed a healthy $ 822,889 in its second week . On April 30 , 2009 on the Late Show with David Letterman , the cast recreated a performance on the same stage at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the original tribe . The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical , the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical and the Drama League Award for Distinguished Revival of a Musical . Its cast album won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album . By August 2009 , the revival had recouped its entire $ 5,760,000 investment , becoming one of the fastest-recouping musicals in Broadway history . When the Broadway cast transferred to London for the 2010 West-End revival , a mostly new tribe took over on Broadway on March 9 , 2010 , including former American Idol finalists Ace Young as Berger and Diana DeGarmo as Sheila . Kyle Riabko assumed the role of Claude , and Annaleigh Ashford played Jeanie . Sales decreased after the original cast transferred to London , and the revival closed on June 27 , 2010 after 29 previews and 519 regular performances . A U.S. National Tour of the production began on October 21 , 2010 . Principals included Steel Burkhardt as Berger , Paris Remillard as Claude and Caren Lyn Tackett as Sheila . The tour received mostly positive reviews . The show returned to Broadway for an engagement at the St. James Theatre from July 5 through September 10 , 2011 . After that stop , the tour resumed . The tour ended on January 29 , 2012 . = = = = 2010 West End revival = = = = The 2009 Broadway production was duplicated at the Gielgud Theatre in London 's West End . Previews began on April 1 , 2010 with an official opening on April 14 . The producers were the Public Theater , together with Cameron Mackintosh and Broadway Across America . Nearly all of the New York cast relocated to London . A new addition to the London cast was Luther Creek as Woof . The London revival closed on September 4 , 2010 . The production received mostly enthusiastic reviews . Michael Billington of The Guardian described it as \" a vibrant , joyous piece of living theatre \" , writing , \" it celebrates a period when the joy of life was pitted against the forces of intolerance and the death-dealing might of the military-industrial complex . As Shakespeare once said : ' There 's sap in 't yet . ' \" Charles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph agreed : \" This is a timely and irresistibly vital revival of the greatest of all rock musicals . ... The verve and energy of the company ... is irresistible . \" Michael Coveney of The Independent wrote that Hair is \" one of the great musicals of all time , and a phenomenon that , I 'm relieved to discover , stands up as a period piece \" . In The Times , Benedict Nightingale commented that \" it 's exhilarating , as well as oddly poignant , when a multihued cast dressed in everything from billowing kaftans to Ruritanian army jackets race downstage while delivering that tuneful salute to an age of Aquarius that still refuses to dawn . \" Quentin Letts was a dissenting voice in the Daily Mail . Though praising the performances and the production , he wrote : \" by the end the fraudulence of the gaiety becomes sickening . There is a lack of truthfulness in Hair which may not have been apparent when it was first performed in New York City in 1967 but which , today , is unavoidable . \" = = = = 2014 Hollywood Bowl = = = = In August 2014 , the musical was given a three-night engagement at the Hollywood Bowl . Directed by Adam Shankman , the all-star cast included Kristen Bell as Sheila , Hunter Parrish as Claude , Benjamin Walker as Berger , Amber Riley as Dionne , Jenna Ushkowitz as Jeanie , Sarah Hyland as Crissy , Mario as Hud , and Beverly D 'Angelo and Kevin Chamberlin as Claude 's parents . = = = International success = = = Hair has been performed in most of the countries of the world . After the Berlin Wall fell , the show traveled for the first time to Poland , Lebanon , the Czech Republic and Sarajevo ( featured on ABC 's Nightline with Ted Koppel , when Phil Alden Robinson visited that city in 1996 and discovered a production of Hair there in the midst of the war ) . In 1999 , Michael Butler and director Bo Crowell helped produce Hair in Russia at the Stas Namin Theatre located in Moscow 's Gorky Park . The Moscow production caused a similar reaction as the original did 30 years earlier because Russian soldiers were fighting in Chechnya at the time . Rado wrote in 2003 that the only places where the show had not been performed were \" China , India , Vietnam , the Arctic and Antarctic continents as well as most African countries . \" Since then , an Indian production has been mounted . = = Cultural impact = = = = = Popular culture = = = The New York Times noted , in 2007 , that \" Hair was one of the last Broadway musicals to saturate the culture as shows from the golden age once regularly did . \" Songs from the show continue to be recorded by major artists . In the 1990s , Evan Dando 's group The Lemonheads recorded \" Frank Mills \" for their 1992 record It 's A Shame About Ray , and Run DMC sampled \" Where Do I Go \" for their 1993 single \" Down With the King \" which went to # 1 on the Billboard rap charts and reached the top 25 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart . In 2004 , \" Aquarius \" was honored at number 33 on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Songs . Songs from the musical have been featured in films and television episodes . For example , in the 2005 movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , the character Willy Wonka welcomed the children with lyrics from \" Good Morning Starshine \" . \" Aquarius \" was performed in the final episode of Laverne and Shirley in 1983 , where the character Carmine moves to New York City to become an actor , and auditions for Hair . \" Aquarius / Let the Sunshine In \" was also performed in the final scene in the film The 40-Year-Old Virgin , and Three Dog Night 's recording of \" Easy to Be Hard \" was featured in the first part of David Fincher 's film Zodiac . On the Simpsons episode \" The Springfield Files \" , the townspeople , Leonard Nimoy , Chewbacca , Dana Scully and Fox Mulder all sing \" Good Morning Starshine . \" The episode \" Hairography \" of the show Glee includes a much-criticized mash-up of the songs \" Hair \" and \" Crazy in Love \" by Beyonc\u00e9 . In addition , Head of the Class featured a two-part episode in 1990 where the head of the English department is determined to disrupt the school 's performance of Hair . The continued popularity of Hair is seen in its number ten ranking in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the \" [ United Kingdom ] ' s Number One Essential Musicals . \" Because of the universality of its pacifist theme , Hair continues to be a popular choice for high-school and university productions . Amateur productions of Hair are also popular worldwide . In 2002 , Peter Jennings featured a Boulder , Colorado , high school production of Hair for his ABC documentary series \" In Search of America \" . A September 2006 community theater production at the 2,000-seat Count Basie Theater in Red Bank , New Jersey , was praised by original producer Michael Butler , who said it was \" one of the best Hairs I have seen in a long time . \" Another example of a recent large-scale amateur production is the Mountain Play production at the 4,000-seat Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre in Mount Tamalpais State Park in Mill Valley , California in the spring of 2007 . = = = Legacy = = = Hair was Broadway 's first concept musical , a form that dominated the musical theatre of the seventies , including shows like Company , Follies , Pacific Overtures and A Chorus Line . While the development of the concept musical was an unexpected consequence of Hair 's tenure on Broadway , the expected rock music revolution on Broadway turned out to be less than complete . MacDermot followed Hair with three successive rock scores : Two Gentlemen of Verona ( 1971 ) ; Dude ( 1972 ) , a second collaboration with Ragni ; and Via Galactica ( 1972 ) . While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical , Dude failed after just sixteen performances , and Via Galactica flopped after a month . According to Horn , these and other such \" failures may have been the result of producers simply relying on the label ' rock musical ' to attract audiences without regard to the quality of the material presented . \" Jesus Christ Superstar ( 1970 ) and Godspell ( 1971 ) were two religiously themed successes of the genre . Grease ( 1971 ) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s , and black-themed musicals like The Wiz ( 1975 ) were heavily influenced by gospel , R & B and soul music . By the late 1970s , the genre had played itself out . Except for a few outposts of rock , like Dreamgirls ( 1981 ) and Little Shop of Horrors ( 1982 ) , audience tastes in the 1980s turned to megamusicals with pop scores , like Les Mis\u00e9rables ( 1985 ) and The Phantom of the Opera ( 1986 ) . Some later rock musicals , such as Rent ( 1996 ) and Spring Awakening ( 2006 ) , as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music , like We Will Rock You ( 2002 ) and Rock of Ages ( 2009 ) , have found success . But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair . Critic Clive Barnes commented , \" There really weren 't any rock musicals . No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway . ... You might think of the musical Tommy , but it was never conceived as a Broadway show . ... And one can see why . There 's so much more money in records and rock concerts . I mean , why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia ? \" On the other hand , Hair had a profound effect not only on what was acceptable on Broadway , but as part of the very social movements that it celebrated . For example , in 1970 , Butler , Castelli and the various Hair casts contributed to fundraising for the World Youth Assembly , a United Nations-sponsored organization formed in connection with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the United Nations . The Assembly enabled 750 young representatives from around the world to meet in New York in July 1970 to discuss social issues . For about a week , cast members worldwide collected donations at every show for the fund . Hair raised around $ 250,000 and ended up being the principal financier of the Assembly . Tribe members and Hair crews also contributed a days ' pay , and Butler contributed a days ' profits from these productions . Moreover , as Ellen Stewart , La MaMa 's founder , noted : Hair came with blue jeans , comfortable clothing , colors , beautiful colors , sounds , movement . ... And you can go to AT & T and see a secretary today , and she 's got on blue jeans . ... You can go anywhere you want , and what Hair did , it is still doing twenty years later .... A kind of emancipation , a spiritual emancipation that came from [ O 'Horgan 's ] staging . ... Hair until this date has influenced every single thing that you see on Broadway , off-Broadway , off-off-Broadway , anywhere in the world , you will see elements of the experimental techniques that Hair brought not just to Broadway , but to the entire world .",

                    "text": "Thriller ( viral video ) = Thriller is a viral video featuring the CPDRC Dancing Inmates of a high-security penitentiary . In 2007 , the inmates of Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center ( CPDRC ) , a maximum security prison in Cebu , the Philippines , imitated the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson 's \" Thriller \" . The footage , uploaded onto video-sharing website YouTube , became a viral video . The idea behind the dance came from the prison 's chief , Byron F. Garcia . Garcia first conceived the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit . Music was then added to provide additional motivation . The convicts marched and danced to several songs , including \" In the Navy \" and \" Y.M.C.A. \" by the Village People . Garcia posted the prisoners ' dance regimes onto the internet in April 2007 . The most popular of the presentations was their Thriller performance . The video showed over 1,500 male inmates emulating Michael Jackson 's dance moves from the original Thriller short film . Jackson fan Crisanto Nierre played the role of the pop star , with the openly gay former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane playing his girlfriend . The video became one of the most viewed on the internet , receiving 300,000 views per day at its peak . As of December 27 , 2014 , the Thriller viral video has received over 54 million reported views . The clip also garnered complaints , with one professor stating that the dancing does not rehabilitate CPDRC inmates . The prison and its officers faced allegations of prisoner abuse , claims which both the officers and inmates denied . The prisoners have performed numerous other songs , including \" Radio Ga Ga \" , \" Together in Electric Dreams \" , \" Holding Out for a Hero \" , and several songs from Sister Act . One of their performances involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama , Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi . As a result of the prisoners ' internet fame , many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts . Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard . At the jail , visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates . They can also buy souvenir prison shirts . = = Background = = I hope that all the people who see us will be happy in knowing that we , despite being prisoners , we were able to do this . Before the dancing , our problems were really heavy to bear . Dancing takes our minds away from our problems . Our bodies became more healthy . As for the judges , they may be impressed with us , seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case . We are being rehabilitated in a good way . \u2014 Crisanto Nierre , inmate who played Michael Jackson Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center is a maximum security prison in Cebu , in the Cebu Province of the Philippines . The center is run by Byron F. Garcia , and its inmates are either facing trial or are serving sentences for crimes ranging from shoplifting to murder and rape . In 2007 , more than 300 of the inmates were facing murder charges . Garcia initiated the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit . \" While the goal is to keep the body fit in order to keep the mind fit , such may not happen if it is done in a manner deemed unpleasurable \" , Garcia said . Considering music to be \" the language of the soul \" , Garcia added it to the prisoner 's workout regime . Garcia also wanted the music workouts to be a way in which to break down gang factions amongst prison inmates . Melita Thomeczeck , the Philippine 's deputy consulate general in New York , suspected that the warden added the music in order to take detainee 's minds off of other matters . One of the first songs the prisoners worked with was Pink Floyd 's \" Another Brick in the Wall \" . Garcia had them march to the music as a bid to increase participation in exercise . Other early musical choices included \" In the Navy \" and \" Y.M.C.A. \" by the Village People . The Village People songs were chosen so that macho inmates \" wouldn 't be offended by being asked to dance \" . For Filipinos , music and dancing is said to be a way of life . Natives of the Philippines are reported to have a tendency to \" sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations \" . Thomeczeck stated , \" The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance . Whatever they are in a natural way , they can continue that habit in prison . \" Despite other colleagues ' enthusiasm about the dancing , chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing , as CPDRC was undermanned . Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center 's Operations Manual , Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen . \" As a jail officer , I got worried when I saw it \" , Rubio commented . The inmates were not fond of the idea either , pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison . Prisoners eventually agreed to dance , but admitted that the routines took awhile to master . \" It was difficult at first , but eventually we inmates got used to it \" , inmate Mario Benito revealed . The program began as an experiment and , after six months , prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one . = = Video and response = = In 2007 , Garcia posted several videos of his inmates ' performances on YouTube in hopes of inspiring other prisons to learn from the experience . The clips became some of the most talked about in cyberspace . The most popular of the videos was uploaded in April 2007 . It showed over 1,500 male inmates imitating the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson 's \" Thriller \" . The prisoners wore their orange jail-issue jumpsuits during the performance in the jail 's exercise yard . The Los Angeles Times later commented that the dance moves were not lifted directly from the video , \" but they are performed with such precision it somehow seems that they must have been \" . Inmate Crisanto Nierre played the role of Michael Jackson . Nierre , who at the time was awaiting trial on drug charges , has been a fan of Jackson since he was in a dance troupe at high school . USA Today noted that his favorite Jackson tracks were \" Bad \" and \" Smooth Criminal \" . Former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane , who is gay , played the part of Jackson 's girlfriend . At the time , Resane had already been at the prison for three years , also awaiting trial on drug charges . Forty-eight hours after being uploaded onto YouTube , the video had been viewed 266,000 times . After a week , the number of hits had risen to over one million . Within two weeks of the Thriller video being uploaded , it had been viewed by some three million YouTube users . The following week , the number had almost doubled , coming close to six million hits . On average , the clip received 300,000 views per day at its peak . The video generated mixed reviews , with some critics claiming that Garcia forced the inmates to perform , an accusation the prisoners refuted . Several of the inmates showed devotion towards their prison chief , with as many as 20 prisoners bearing tattoos with Garcia 's name . Garcia 's concept of having prisoners dance as part of a rehabilitation program has been copied by several prisons , including jails in Quezon province and Muntinlupa . Garcia commented that the movie showed that dancing is not a cruel or unusual punishment . He claimed that his prison showed that negative inmates could be turned into positive individuals , through the concept of a \" revolutionized penology \" . Following Garcia 's presentation of an inmate performance at the province 's Founding Day celebrations , a donation of $ 35,000 was given to the prison . Each inmate received $ 22 of the gift , deposited into a prison passbook account . The remaining money went to the Cebu province and its employees , to defray the costs of incarceration . The prison inmates Thriller performance made it to the pages of Time \u2014 on the international magazine \u2019 s list of the most watchable Internet videos for 2007 . The inmates ' interpretation of the Thriller music video was ranked the fifth of 10 \" most popular viral videos \" of the year , or the \" Web clips we couldn \u2019 t stop watching \" . The list also included appearances by Hillary Clinton , Will Ferrell and Chris Crocker for his Leave Britney Alone ! clip . Time described the convicts as \" orange-jumpsuited accused murderers , rapists and drug dealers \" , and noted that their performance was made in \" homage \" to Jackson 's Thriller . The magazine stated that the viral video had been downloaded more than nine million times . ( As of January 18 , 2008 , the reported views of the video have reached almost 15 million ) . Edward Latessa , professor and head of division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati , declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated . Latessa stated that the prisoners may think that they are getting something out of the performances , when , in reality , they are not . He described it as having a potentially harmful effect . The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs , like substance abuse or family reunification programs , should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor . The detention workers disagreed with the assessment , deeming the activities to be an integral part of rehabilitation . \" It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance \" , Thomeczeck argued . \" In more ways than one , it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration . It 's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually . That 's good , isn 't it ? \" . Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade , \" best-of \" list , saying , \" Now that 's a ' breakout ' hit : The clip of inmates at a high-security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson 's \" Thriller \" has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007 . \" = = Aftermath = = In late 2007 , Pinoy Big Brother : Celebrity Edition 2 scheduled a visit from some of its celebrities to the provincial jail . The celebrities danced with 1,600 CPDRC inmates to the tune of \" Rico Mambo \" as part of their weekly task , set by Big Brother . The request had been made by Maria Rowena Benitez , Pinoy Big Brother production manager . The housemates were not informed of their task , but were brought to the prison in blindfolds . They were then subsequently given back their sight , with the inmates surrounding them . Beforehand , it was also announced that the Big Brother celebrity housemates would perform a concert , with the proceeds being donated to CPDRC . The concert , held inside the Pinoy Big Brother house in Manila , was attended by 100 people , who each paid P1,000 . The CPDRC inmates have performed numerous other songs , including Queen 's \" Radio Ga Ga \" and several songs from Sister Act , with prisoners dressing as nuns in habits . 44 female inmates , held in a separate wing from the males , joined the men in a dance to \" I Will Follow Him \" . \" Hail Holy Queen \" , from Sister Act 2 , and the Algorithm March were also performed by the convicts and then upload onto YouTube . The inmates dance in order to help pass the time while serving their prison sentences or awaiting a trial . More than 900 of the inmates take part in the routines , with a small group of dancers at the core of each performance . Every prisoner at CPDRC , apart from the old and the infirm , has a part in the routine . Garcia directs and choreographs each of the dances . The inmates ' participation is said to be completely voluntary , with no prisoner being forced to dance . \" It would be different if they are being forced to dance \" , declared Rubio . \" I 've never known any prisoners being forced to dance . It 's normal to dance . \" The inmates have express pride at their performing success , and routinely query the viewing figures for their routines . By August 2007 , ten of the prisoners ' performances had been viewed over 100,000 times each . In 2007 , the prisoners stated that they were to perform to Vanilla Ice 's \" Ice Ice Baby \" . At the time , they were also practicing Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder 's \" Together in Electric Dreams \" , a homage to the inmates ' fans . In January 2008 , Garcia requested that the prisoners perform their Thriller routine at the annual Sinulog festival , a popular street-music festival organised by the Catholic Augustinian in celebration of baby Jesus . The nine-day fiesta and party is preceded by a solemn religious procession . The mayor of Cebu , Tomas Osmena , refused to permit the request , stating that the inmates could dance all they wanted in jail . \" I will not allow it even if Michael Jackson joins them \" , he commented . Garcia had hoped that , by allowing the inmates to be a part of the Sinulog celebrations , Cebu would showcase the success of his rehabilitation programme . \" By showing these highly disciplined inmates , perhaps we might just be giving hope that Cebu is not just about the mardi gras , but rather , Cebu is about leadership and good governance . \" The CPDRC inmates were expected to be tough competition for the Lumad Basakonon , a group which has won the free interpretation category of the Sinulog festival for two consecutive years . As a result of the prisoners ' internet fame , many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts . Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard . At the jail , visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates . They can also buy souvenir prison shirts . A research student from The Netherlands , Anne Yzerman , attended one of the two-hour shows and praised the convicts . \" They are so good at dancing all the time . I was really impressed . \" The CPDRC inmates dance numbers include a rendition of Bonnie Tyler 's \" Holding Out for a Hero \" . The performance involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama , Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi . After Michael Jackson 's death on June 25 , 2009 , Cebu prison officials announced that the prison inmates would be recreating the Thriller routine on the following Saturday , June 27 , 2009 . On June 27 , 2009 , the tribute video was uploaded with a dance routine for \" Ben \" , \" I 'll Be There \" , and \" We Are the World \" . In January 2010 , the prisoners performed \" The Drill \" and \" They Don 't Care About Us \" [ filmed on professional camera ] as another tribute to Jackson , and for the release of the Michael Jackson 's This Is It DVD and Blu-ray disc . In 2011 , in the Glee episode \" The Sue Sylvester Shuffle \" , Glee club director Will Schuester made a reference about the \" Thriller \" viral video to motivate the children to do a \" Thriller \" performance much like from the Philippine prison .",

                    "text": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A. Richardson , Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Sanborn Contracts- 1874 ) ( Resigned and appointed Federal Judge by Grant . ) George H. Williams , Attorney General \u2013 ( Pratt & Boyd- 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Columbus Delano , Secretary of Interior \u2013 ( Bogus Agents \u2013 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Orville E. Babcock , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Black Friday \u2013 1869 ) ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Safe Burglary Conspiracy \u2013 1876 ) ( Acquitted in Saint Louis Whiskey Ring trials by jury due to Grant 's defense testimony in his favor . ) John McDonald , Internal Revenue Supervisor , St. Louis \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Indicted and convicted ; served prison time ; claimed Grant was involved in the Whiskey Ring but did not supply any evidence . ) Horace Porter , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) William W. Belknap , Secretary of War \u2013 ( Trading Post Ring- 1876 ) ( Resigned ; Convicted by House ; acquitted by Senate ; indictments against Belknap in Washington D.C. court were dropped by judge at request of Grant and Attorney General Alphonso Taft . ) George M. Robeson , Secretary of Navy \u2013 ( Naval Department Ring- 1876 ) ( Grant defended Robeson in State of the Union address . Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P. Bradley \u2013 1870 Ward Hunt \u2013 1873 Morrison Remick Waite ( Chief Justice ) \u2013 1874 = = = States admitted to the Union = = = Colorado \u2013 August 1 , 1876 Colorado came into the Union just in time to give enough electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

I bought them to use on my new ceramic cook ware and they are GREAT! They do not scratch my cook ware, stove top or anything else. I'm not a fan of sponges, but I really like these. I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks. Normally, I'd have thrown it away by now, but, again, no odors and whatever I clean up comes right out of the sponge. I do use a liquid cleaner on these after use. I'd recommend these."

Both of them lost their rubbers , giving Switzerland a 2 \u2013 0 lead . Under the rules , for Sunday \u2019 s reverse singles , Bates would have been able to substitute Mackin with Greg Rusedski , so that Rusedski would play Wawrinka , while Murray played Federer . However , Bates believed that Federer was virtually unbeatable because he was on a winning streak and hadn \u2019 t lost since June , and consequently Britain gambled on beating Wawrinka twice , with Murray playing Wawrinka when he was freshest . In the doubles , Murray / Rusedski played Federer and Yves Allegro , leaving Rusedski to play only once . The British tactics came to nought as Switzerland won the doubles rubber as well , gaining un unassailable 3 \u2013 0 lead after two the days . Alan Mackin and David Sherwood were consequently nominated for the dead singles rubbers losing both of them , resulting in a clean sweep for Switzerland . = = = = 2006 = = = = For the Europe / Africa Zone Group I tie against Serbia and Montenegro , Murray had been suffering with a bacterial infection , so he was restricted to playing the doubles alongside Greg Rusedski , which they lost . With Arvind Parmar also losing in the singles , Great Britain were beaten 3 \u2013 2 . In the same week as the relegation 1st round play-off against Israel , Murray was officially entered for the ATP tournament in Indianapolis , sparking fears about his commitment . There was a controversial move by the Lawn Tennis Association to pay \u00a3 500,000 towards the cost of Murray 's next coach , Brad Gilbert as a way of securing Murray 's long-term services for the Davis Cup team . In the event , Murray played , winning his first singles . However he lost the doubles with Jamie Delgado , during which Murray damaged his shoulder and neck . He was diagnosed with whiplash , causing him to sit out the final day \u2019 s singles , and eventually Great Britain were beaten 3 \u2013 2 to proceed to the relegation 2nd round play-off against Ukraine . With Murray and Greg Rusedski playing , Great Britain beat Ukraine 3 \u2013 2 , to stay in Group I. = = = = 2007 = = = = In the tie against the Netherlands , Andy Murray and Tim Henman won the opening singles , then Jamie Murray and Greg Rusedski won the doubles to secure victory . Rusedski announced his retirement on the doubles court . In the run up to World Group play-off against Croatia , Tim Henman had announced he would retire after this match . Murray said \" I 'm not going to want to let the team down or let Tim down , I 'd feel terrible if I was the one that was responsible for losing Tim 's last tie . This means a lot to me and it 's definitely going to be the biggest Davis Cup match of my career . \" \" Everyone is going to want to win for Tim . I 'm hoping the way I play will show him what his career meant to my development and me . \" Great Britain beat Croatia 4 \u2013 1 to qualify for the World Group in 2008 . After the retirement of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski , the Davis Cup team was now dependent on Murray having to win three matches , though Henman had told him how wearing and time consuming that can be . While the LTA was funding Brad Gilbert , Murray was obligated to play for his country , but in November , Murray finished with Brad Gilbert as his coach . = = = = 2008 = = = = Murray skipped the World Group 1st round tie against Argentina , over fears he could exacerbate a knee injury , leaving the British team in a hopeless situation \u2013 they lost 4 \u2013 1 . Jamie was furious that Andy was letting them down and the Murrays would not speak to each other for two weeks . Seven months later , as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria , Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie . When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles , John Lloyd suffered criticism for not playing Andy . Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3 \u2013 2 and were relegated to Europe / Africa Zone Group I. = = = = 2009 = = = = Murray withdrew from the tie against Ukraine after failing to shake off a virus , and Great Britain lost 4 \u2013 1 . Murray suffered an injury to his left wrist at the US Open , and would have rested if his next event had not been the Davis Cup . At the Poland match , he won both his singles rubbers . For the doubles with Ross Hutchins , Murray began in the right-hand court , the side usually occupied by the less dominant partner , so as to afford more protection to his troublesome left wrist than when striking double-handed backhands from the left court . , though allowed his partner to resume his usual role in the second set . However , the pair succumbed to the world-class Polish duo , and Poland won 3 \u2013 2 ; Great Britain were relegated to Europe / Africa Zone Group II for the first time since 1996 . Murray had aggravated his wrist injury , so couldn 't play for another six weeks . = = = = 2010 = = = = Murray pulled out of the match against Lithuania , so younger players could gain more international experience , and to allow him to focus on trying to win Grand Slam titles . His absence was criticised by Davis Cup captain John Lloyd . The Lithuanian side entered the tie as underdogs ; fielding a team of teenagers , but Lithuania won 3 \u2013 2 . This was the first time that Great Britain had lost five ties in a row and was described as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain . It led to the resignation of John Lloyd as Davis Cup captain , with Britain now threatened with relegation to the lowest tier of the competition . = = = = 2011 = = = = Murray returned for the Europe / Africa Zone Group II tie versus Luxembourg . He beat Laurent Bram , a tennis coach , 6 \u2013 0 , 6 \u2013 0 , 6 \u2013 0 , the last time a Briton had achieved this score line in Davis Cup was Alan Mills defeating Josef Offenheim in 1959 , also against Luxembourg . Andy and Jamie Murray teamed up for the first time in Davis Cup doubles for a straight sets win . In his second singles match , Andy then recorded a third straight sets victory , over world No. 81 Gilles M\u00fcller , with Great Britain eventually winning 4 \u2013 1 . Three of Hungary 's top four players were not available for the Great Britain vs Hungary tie , so Murray defeated Sebo Kiss , a law student without a ranking , in his first singles rubber . Earlier , James Ward overcame sickness to beat the Hungarian No 1 , then Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins won the doubles , and Great Britain was promoted into Europe / Africa Zone Group I for the first time since 2009 . Afterwards , Murray criticised the tournament schedule and cast doubt on his availability for next year \u2019 s Davis Cup . = = = = 2013 = = = = By 2013 , Great Britain 's other tennis players had earned the team a chance to return to the World Group . Murray was suffering a vulnerable back and intended to have surgery after the US Open . Murray revealed that the fear of being branded \u201c unpatriotic \u201d led him to delay the surgery until after the Davis Cup tie in Croatia in September , which jeopardised his place in the next Australian Open . With Croatia 's No 1 Marin \u010cili\u0107 absent for committing a doping offence , Murray won both his singles matches and the doubles with Colin Fleming , Great Britain eventually winning 4 \u2013 1 , for their first victory on clay since Ukraine in 2006 , and returning to the World Group for the first time since 2008 . = = = = 2014 = = = = At the World Group first round tie against the United States in San Diego , Murray defeated Donald Young and James Ward unexpectedly beat Sam Querrey on the first day . On the last day , Murray beat Sam Querrey to put Great Britain into the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup for the first time since 1986 . Britain \u2019 s only previous victory on American soil was 111 years ago . Murray had to recover from a virus to play in the Quarter Final tie against Italy in Naples after missing the Thursday draw ceremony . James Ward lost his rain delayed match , while Murray \u2019 s match against Andreas Seppi was halted on Friday evening due to fading light with the score at 6 \u2013 4 , 5 \u2013 5 to Murray . On Saturday morning , Murray finished his match , winning 6 \u2013 4 , 7 \u2013 5 , 6 \u2013 3 . Two hours later , Murray partnered Colin Fleming to win the doubles rubber . Murray had only beaten one top ten player on clay , Nikolay Davydenko , back in 2009 , and was upset by Fabio Fognini , world No. 13 , in straight sets , which took Great Britain to the deciding final rubber . However , James Ward was defeated by Andreas Seppi , also in straight sets , knocking Great Britain out of the Davis Cup . = = = = 2015 = = = = Murray helped lead Great Britain to the final of the World Group for the first time since 1978 , winning both his singles rubbers in the matches against the USA , France and Australia . In the final , Murray defeated Belgium 's David Goffin to win the Davis Cup for Great Britain , 79 years after the national team 's last win . = = = Olympics = = = Murray represented Great Britain at his maiden Olympics in Beijing 2008 . He competed in the singles and doubles competitions . Despite being seeded sixth in the singles competition , he was eliminated in the first round by Chinese Taipei 's Yen-hsun Lu . Along with his brother Jamie , he advanced to the second round of the doubles competition with a win over the Canadian pairing of Daniel Nestor and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Niemeyer . The Murray brothers were eliminated in the second round by France 's Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment and Michael Llodra . In February , Murray pulled out of the Davis Cup tie against Argentina , because of a knee injury , so Argentina thrashed the under-strength British team . Jamie Murray scathingly criticised Andy and they did not speak to each other for a fortnight . Their rift continued in the Olympic doubles , over a perceived lack of effort from Andy . At the London 2012 Olympics , Murray competed in the singles , doubles ( partnering his brother Jamie ) and mixed doubles ( partnering Laura Robson ) . In the singles , he won the Gold Medal , including straight-set victories over Novak Djokovic in the semifinals and Roger Federer in the final , four weeks after Federer had beaten him in on the same court in the Wimbledon final . He also won the silver medal in the mixed doubles , losing to the Belarusian pairing of Max Mirnyi and Victoria Azarenka . = = Rivalries = = = = = Murray vs. Djokovic = = = Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have met 34 times with Djokovic leading 24 \u2013 10 . Djokovic leads 5 \u2013 1 on clay , 19 \u2013 7 on hard courts , and Murray leads 2 \u2013 0 on grass . The two are almost exactly the same age , with Murray being only a week older than Djokovic . They went to training camp together , and Murray won the first match they ever played as teenagers . The pair have met 17 times in finals , with Djokovic leading 10 \u2013 7 . Ten of the finals were at ATP Masters 1000 events , and they are tied at 5 \u2013 5 . They have met in seven Major finals : The 2011 Australian Open , the 2012 US Open , the 2013 Australian Open , the 2013 Wimbledon Championships , the 2015 Australian Open , the 2016 Australian Open , and the 2016 French Open . Djokovic has won in Australia four times and their single French open final , Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon . The former of Murray 's victories was the longest ever final at the US Open , tying with the 1988 final played between Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander at 4 hours and 53 minutes , while the latter was notable for being the first home triumph in men 's singles at Wimbledon since 1936 . They also played a nearly five-hour long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open , which Djokovic won 7 \u2013 5 in the fifth set after Murray led 2 sets to 1 . Murray and Djokovic met again in 2012 at the London 2012 Olympic Games , with Murray winning in straight sets . During the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters , Murray held five championship points in the second set , however Djokovic saved each of them , forcing a deciding set . He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title , ending Murray 's 12 \u2013 0 winning streak at the event . The three set matches they played in Rome and Shanghai in 2011 and 2012 respectively were voted the ATP World Tour Match of the Year for each respective season . Due to the tight competition between 2008 and 2013 , many saw this as the emerging rivalry . Djokovic went on to dominate the rivalry after the 2013 Wimbledon final , winning 13 of their last 15 matches . Their most recent meeting took place at the 2016 French Open final where Djokovic defeated Murray in four sets to win his first French Open title and complete the Career Grand Slam . = = = Murray vs. Federer = = = Andy Murray and Roger Federer have met 25 times with Federer leading 14 \u2013 11 . Federer leads 12 \u2013 10 on hard courts , 2 \u2013 1 on grass , and they have never met on clay . After Federer won the first professional match they played , Murray dominated the first half of the rivalry , winning 8 of their first 13 matches from 2005 until 2010 . The second half of the rivalry has been dominated by Federer , who since won 9 of their last 12 matches from 2010 , and has lead their rivalry since the 2014 ATP World Tour Finals . Federer leads 5 \u2013 3 in finals , having won each of their Grand Slam Final meetings at the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open , both of which Federer won in straight sets , and the 2012 Wimbledon Championships , where Murray took the first set , but ended up losing in 4 sets . Murray leads 6 \u2013 3 in ATP 1000 tournaments and 2 \u2013 0 in finals . They have met five times at the ATP World Tour Finals , with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008 and Federer coming out victorious in London in 2009 , 2010 , 2012 , and in 2014 . In August 2012 , Murray met Federer in the final of the London 2012 Olympics at Wimbledon Centre Court , just four weeks after the 2012 Wimbledon Final , in which Federer had defeated Murray to win his record-tying 7th title at the All-England Club . Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal , denying Federer a Career Golden Slam . In 2013 Murray beat Federer for the first time in a Major in the semifinals of the Australian Open , prevailing in five sets after Federer had come back twice from a set down . Their last grand slam meeting was at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships semifinals , where a dominant Federer defeated Murray in straight sets , earning a place in his 10th Wimbledon final . Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories over Federer , the other two being Nadal and Djokovic . Their most recent meeting took place at the 2015 Cincinnati Masters semifinals , with Federer winning the match in two close sets , recording his fifth consecutive victory over Murray . = = = Murray vs. Nadal = = = Murray has played against Nadal on 24 occasions since 2007 , with Nadal leading 17 \u2013 7 . Nadal leads 7 \u2013 2 on clay , 3 \u2013 0 on grass and 7 \u2013 5 on hard courts . The pair regularly meet at Grand Slam level , with nine out of their twenty-one meetings coming in slams , with Nadal leading 7 \u2013 2 ( 3 \u2013 0 at Wimbledon , 2 \u2013 0 at the French Open , 1 \u2013 1 at the Australian Open and 1 \u2013 1 at the US Open ) . Eight of these nine appearances have been at quarterfinal and semifinal level . They have never met in a Slam final , however , Murray leads 3 \u2013 1 in ATP finals , with Nadal winning at Indian Wells in 2009 and Murray winning in Rotterdam the same year , Tokyo in 2011 , and at Madrid in 2015 . Murray lost three consecutive Grand Slam semifinals to Nadal in 2011 from the French Open to the US Open . Of the past 20 Grand Slam drawsheets , they have been drawn in the same half 16 times . The pair had not met for three years since the final of the 2011 Japan Open until the quarterfinals of the 2014 Rome Masters , although they were scheduled to meet in the semifinal of the 2012 Miami Masters before Nadal withdrew with injury . At the semifinal stage of the 2014 French Open , Nadal triumphed in a dominant straight sets win for the loss of just 6 games . In one of their most recent meetings , Murray beat Nadal for the first time on clay , and the first time in a Masters 1000 final , at the Madrid Open in 2015 . Murray beat Nadal at the 2016 Mutual Madrid Open in the semifinals . Their most recent meeting took place at the 2016 Madrid Open semifinals with Murray winning the match in straight sets . = = Playing style = = Murray plays an all-court game with an emphasis on defensive baseline play , and professional tennis coach Paul Annacone stated that Murray \" may be the best counterpuncher on tour today . \" His strengths include groundstrokes with low error rate , the ability to anticipate and react , and his transition from defence to offence with speed , which enables him to hit winners from defensive positions . His playing style has been likened to that of Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 . Murray also has one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour , with dynamic stroke execution while he primarily uses his forehand and a sliced backhand to let opponents play into his hands . Tim Henman has stated that Murray may now have the best lob in the game , succeeding Lleyton Hewitt . Murray 's tactics often involve passive exchanges from the baseline . He is capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents who are used to the slow rally . Murray is also one of the top returners in the game , often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate . For this reason , Murray is rarely aced . Murray is known for being one of the most intelligent tacticians on the court , often constructing points . Murray is most proficient on a fast surface , like grass , where he has won eight singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal . He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game , ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid , as well as his first French Open final . While Murray 's serve is a major weapon for him , with his first serve reaching speeds of 130 mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points , it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure , especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve . Since his 2011 season and Ivan Lendl 's coaching , he has worked to improve his consistency , second serve and mental game , resulting in a more offensive game . = = Endorsements and equipment = = In 2009 , German manufacturer Adidas and Murray signed a five-year-deal worth \u00a3 30 million . This included wearing their range of tennis shoes . The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep his shirt sleeve sponsors Shiatzy Chen , Royal Bank of Scotland and Highland Spring . Before he was signed by Adidas in late 2009 , he wore Fred Perry apparel . At the end of their contract together Adidas decided not to re-sign with Murray , and he began a 4-year partnership with athletic apparel company Under Armour in December 2014 , reportedly worth $ 25 million . Murray uses Head rackets , and regularly appears in advertisements for the brand . In June 2012 , the Swiss watch manufacturer Rado announced that Murray had signed a deal to wear their D-Star 200 model . = = Charitable work = = Murray is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with David Beckham . Footage from the launch at Wembley Stadium can be seen on YouTube and the charity 's website . Murray also made ' Nets Needed ' , a short public service announcement , for the charity to help raise awareness and funds to help in the fight against malaria . Murray has also taken part in several charity tennis events , including the Rally for Relief events that took place prior to the start of the 2011 Australian Open . In June 2013 , Murray teamed up with former British number 1 Tim Henman for a charity doubles match against Murray 's coach and eight-time grand slam champion Ivan Lendl , and world No. 6 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych at the Queen 's Club in London . The event named Rally Against Cancer was organised to raise money for Royal Marsden Cancer Charity after his best friend and fellow British player Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with Hodgkin 's lymphoma . The event took place following the final day of competitive play at the AEGON Championships , on Sunday 16 June . Subsequently , following his victory at the tournament , Murray donated his entire prize money pot to The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity . In June 2014 , following the death of Elena Baltacha , Murray featured in an event known as ' Rally for Bally ' . Murray played at Queen 's Club alongside Victoria Azarenka , Martina Hingis , Heather Watson and his brother Jamie . The event raised money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis . Children from Baltacha 's academy took to the court to play alongside Murray . As a result of his various charitable exploits , Murray was awarded the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award for 2014 . = = Image = = = = = National identity = = = Murray identifies himself as Scottish and British . His national identity has often been commented on by the media . While making a cameo appearance on the comedy show Outnumbered , Murray was asked whether he was British or Scottish , to which he responded \" It depends if I 'm winning \" . Much of the discussion about Murray 's national identity began prior to Wimbledon 2006 , when he was quoted as saying he would \" support whoever England is playing \" at the 2006 World Cup . English ex-tennis player Tim Henman confirmed that the remarks had been made in jest and were only in response to Murray being teased by journalist Des Kelly and Henman about Scotland 's failure to qualify . Murray initially refused to endorse either side of the debate in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence , citing the abuse he had received after his comments in 2006 . Just before the referendum , Murray tweeted a message that was considered by the media to be supportive of independence . He received online abuse for expressing his opinion , including messages that were described as \" vile \" by Police Scotland ; one referred to the Dunblane massacre . A few days after the vote , in which a 55 % majority opposed Scottish independence , Murray said that he did not regret stating his view , but admitted that it was out of character and that he would concentrate on his tennis career in the future . = = = Other = = = In 2006 , there was uproar after a match with Kenneth Carlsen . Having been given a warning for racket abuse , he went on in the post-match interview to state that he and Carlsen had \" played like women \" during the first set . Murray was booed for the remark , but explained later that the comment had been intended as a jocular response to what Svetlana Kuznetsova had said at the Hopman Cup . A few months later , Murray was fined for swearing at the umpire during a Davis Cup doubles rubber with the Serbia and Montenegro Davis Cup team . Murray refused to shake hands with the umpire at the end of the match . In 2007 , Murray suggested that tennis had a match-fixing problem , stating that everyone knows it goes on , in the wake of the investigation surrounding Nikolay Davydenko . Both Davydenko and Rafael Nadal questioned his comments , but Murray responded that his words had been taken out of context . = = Career statistics = = = = = Ranking = = = = = = Grand Slam tournament performance timeline = = = Finals : 11 ( 3 titles , 8 runner-ups ) = = = Olympic Games = = = = = = = Finals : 2 ( 1 gold medal , 1 silver medal ) = = = = = = = = = Singles : 1 ( 1 \u2013 0 ) = = = = = = = = = = Mixed Doubles : 1 ( 0 \u2013 1 ) = = = = = = = = Records and achievements = = = These records were attained in the Open Era .

Regarded as the fastest person ever timed , he is the first man to hold both the 100 metres and 200 metres world records since fully automatic time measurements became mandatory in 1977 . Along with his teammates , he also set the world record in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay . He is the reigning Olympic champion in these three events , and the first man at the modern Olympic Games to win six gold medals in sprinting , and an eleven-time World champion . He was the first in the modern Olympics era to achieve the \" double double \" of winning 100 m and 200 m titles at consecutive games ( 2008 and 2012 ) , and topped this through the first \" double triple \" ( including 4 \u00d7 100 m relays ) . Although gaining worldwide popularity for a sprint double victory at the Beijing Games , Bolt has had more victories as a 200 m runner . While he had not won any significant 100 m title prior to the 2008 Olympics , he had won numerous crowns in the 200 m event at the youth , junior and senior levels . Further , at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow , Bolt completed a hat-trick of 200 m world titles by winning his third straight gold in the event . His 2009 record breaking margin for 100 m , from 9.69 seconds ( his own previous world record ) to 9.58 , is the highest since the start of fully automatic time measurements . Bolt 's achievements in sprinting have earned him the media nickname \" Lightning Bolt \" , and awards including the IAAF World Athlete of the Year , Track & Field Athlete of the Year , and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year ( three times ) . He is the highest paid athlete ever in track and field . He has been called the world 's most marketable athlete . By winning three gold medals at the 2015 World Championships , Bolt became the first athlete in the 32-year history of the IAAF athletics world championships to complete a \" triple triple \" making him the most successful athlete at the IAAF championships . On 14 February 2015 , Bolt announced that he intends to retire from athletics after the 2017 World Championships in London . = = Early years = = Bolt was born on 21 August 1986 in Sherwood Content , a small town in Trelawny , Jamaica , and grew up with his parents , Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt , his brother Sadiki , and his sister Sherine . His parents ran the local grocery store in the rural area , and Bolt spent his time playing cricket and football in the street with his brother , later saying , \" When I was young , I didn 't really think about anything other than sports \" . As a child , Bolt attended Waldensia Primary , where he first began to show his sprinting potential , running in the annual national primary-schools ' meeting for his parish . By the age of twelve , Bolt had become the school 's fastest runner over the 100 metres distance . Upon his entry to William Knibb Memorial High School , Bolt continued to focus on other sports , but his cricket coach noticed Bolt 's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events . Pablo McNeil , a former Olympic sprint athlete , and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt , encouraging him to focus his energy on improving his athletic abilities . The school had a history of success in athletics with past students , including sprinter Michael Green . Bolt won his first annual high school championships medal in 2001 , taking the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 22.04 seconds . McNeil soon became his primary coach , and the two enjoyed a positive partnership , although McNeil was occasionally frustrated by Bolt 's lack of dedication to his training and his penchant for practical jokes . = = = Early competitions = = = Performing for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event , Bolt clocked a personal best of 48.28 s in the 400 metres in the 2001 CARIFTA Games , winning a silver medal . The 200 m also yielded a silver as Bolt finished in 21.81 s . He made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen , Hungary . Running in the 200 m event , he failed to qualify for the finals , but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s . Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously , however , and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials . He was detained by the police for his practical joke , and there was an outcry from the local community , which blamed coach McNeil for the incident . However , the controversy subsided , and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games , where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s , respectively . He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships . Bolt is one of only nine athletes , ( along with Valerie Adams , Veronica Campbell-Brown , Jacques Freitag , Yelena Isinbayeva , Jana Pittman , Dani Samuels , David Storl , Kirani James ) to win world championships at the youth , junior , and senior level of an athletic event . Former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson recognised Bolt 's talent and arranged for him to move to Kingston , along with Jermaine Gonzales , so he could train with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association ( JAAA ) at the University of Technology , Jamaica . = = = Rise to prominence = = = The 2002 World Junior Championships before a home crowd in Kingston , Jamaica , gave Bolt a chance to prove his credentials on the world stage . By the age of 15 , he had grown to 1.96 metres ( 6 ft 5 in ) tall , and he physically stood out among his peers . He won the 200 m , in a time of 20.61 s , 0.03 seconds slower than his personal best of 20.58 s set in the 1st round . Bolt 's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medalist ever . The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet . However , it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves . As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team , he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres and 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay , running times of 39.15 s and 3 : 04.06 minutes respectively . The flow of medals continued as he won four gold medals at the 2003 CARIFTA Games , and was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the most outstanding athlete of the games . He won another gold at the 2003 World Youth Championships . He set a new championship record in the 200 m with a time of 20.40 s , despite a 1.1 m / s head wind . Michael Johnson , the 200 m world-record holder , took note of Bolt 's potential but worried that the young sprinter might be over-pressured , stating , \" It 's all about what he does three , four , five years down the line \" . Bolt had also impressed the athletics hierarchy , and he received the IAAF Rising Star Award for 2002 . In his final Jamaican High School Championships in 2003 , he broke both the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s , respectively . Bolt 's runs were a significant improvement upon the previous records , beating the 200 m best by more than half a second and the 400 m record by almost a second . While Bolt improved upon the 200 time three months later , setting the still standing World youth best at the 2003 Pan American Junior Championships , it remains the No. 2 youth time . The 400 time remains No. 6 on all time youth list , only surpassed once since by future Olympic champion Kirani James . Bolt turned his main focus to the 200 m and equalled Roy Martin 's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships . This performance attracted interest from the press , and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson . Indeed , at sixteen years old , Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty , and Bolt 's 200 m time was superior to Maurice Greene 's season 's best that year . Bolt was growing more popular in his homeland . Howard Hamilton , who was given the task of Public Defender by the government , urged the JAAA to nurture him and prevent burnout , calling Bolt \" the most phenomenal sprinter ever produced by this island \" . His popularity and the attractions of the capital city were beginning to be a burden to the young sprinter . Bolt was increasingly unfocused on his athletic career and preferred to eat fast food , play basketball , and party in Kingston 's club scene . In the absence of a disciplined lifestyle , he became ever-more reliant on his natural ability to beat his competitors on the track . As the reigning 200 m champion at both the World Youth and World Junior championships , Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris . He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials . Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that , even if he did not make the final , he would consider setting a personal best a success . However , he suffered a bout of conjunctivitis before the event , and it ruined his training schedule . Realising he would not be in peak condition , the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced . Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity , but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead . Even though he missed the World Championships , Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run . = = Professional athletics career = = = = = 2004 \u2013 2007 Early professional career = = = Under the guidance of new coach Fitz Coleman , Bolt turned professional in 2004 , beginning with the CARIFTA Games in Bermuda . He became the first junior sprinter to run the 200 m in under twenty seconds , taking the world junior record outright with a time of 19.93 s . For the second time in the role , he was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the most outstanding athlete of the 2004 CARIFTA Games . A hamstring injury in May ruined Bolt 's chances of competing in the 2004 World Junior Championships , but he was still chosen for the Jamaican Olympic squad . Bolt headed to the 2004 Athens Olympics with confidence and a new record on his side . However , he was hampered by a leg injury and was eliminated in the first round of the 200 metres with a disappointing time of 21.05 s . American colleges offered Bolt track scholarships on the strength of his performances , but the teenager from Trelawny refused them all , stating that he was content to stay in his homeland of Jamaica . Bolt instead chose the surroundings of the University of Technology , Jamaica , as his professional training ground , staying with the university 's primitive track and weight room that had served him well in his amateur years . The year 2005 signaled a fresh start for Bolt in the form of a new coach , Glen Mills , and a new attitude toward athletics . Mills recognised Bolt 's potential and aimed to cease what he considered an unprofessional approach to the sport . Bolt began training with Mills in preparation for the upcoming athletics season , partnering with more seasoned sprinters such as Kim Collins and Dwain Chambers . The year began well , and in July , he knocked more than a third of a second off the 200 m CAC Championship record with a run of 20.03 s , then registered his 200 m season 's best at London 's Crystal Palace , running in 19.99 s . Misfortune awaited Bolt at the next major event , the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki . Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much improved since the 2004 Olympics , and he saw the World Championships as a way to live up to expectations , stating , \" I really want to make up for what happened in Athens . Hopefully , everything will fall into place \" . Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s , but he suffered an injury in the final , finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s . Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season , and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions . However , his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final . Bolt was involved in a car accident in November , and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations , his training schedule was further upset . His manager , Norman Peart , made Bolt 's training less intensive , and he had fully recuperated the following week . Bolt had continued to improve his performances , and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006 . Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008 . Bolt was less enthusiastic , and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting . He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006 , forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne , and he did not return to track events until May . After his recovery , Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility , and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold . Upon his return to competition , the 200 m remained Bolt 's primary event , beating Justin Gatlin 's meet record in Ostrava , Czech Republic . Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season 's best but , despite the fact that bad weather had impaired his run , he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory . However , a sub-20-second finish was soon his , as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne , Switzerland , finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal . Bolt had focused his athletics aims , stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience . Also , he was more keen on competing over longer distances , setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years . Bolt claimed his first major world medal two months later at the IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart , Germany . He passed the finishing post with a time of 20.10 s , gaining a bronze medal in the process . The IAAF World Cup in Athens , Greece , yielded Bolt 's first senior international silver medal . Wallace Spearmon from the United States won gold with a championship record time of 19.87 s , beating Bolt 's respectable time of 19.96 s . Further 200 m honours on both the regional and international stages awaited Bolt in 2007 . He yearned to run in the 100 metres but Mills was skeptical , believing that Bolt was better suited for middle distances . The coach cited the runner 's difficulty in smoothly starting out of the blocks , and poor habits such as looking back at opponents in sprints . Mills told Bolt that he could run the shorter distance if he broke the 200 m national record . In the Jamaican Championships , he ran 19.75 s in the 200 m , breaking the 36-year-old Jamaican record held by Don Quarrie by 0.11 s . Mills complied with Bolt 's demand to run in the 100 m , and he was entered to run the event at the 23rd Vardinoyiannia meeting in Rethymno , Crete . In his debut tournament run , he set a personal best of 10.03 s , winning the gold medal and feeding his enthusiasm for the event . He built on this achievement at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka , Japan , winning a silver medal . Bolt recorded 19.91 s with a headwind of 0.8 m / s . The race was won by Tyson Gay in 19.76 s , a new championship record . Bolt was a member of the silver medal winning relay team with Asafa Powell , Marvin Anderson , and Nesta Carter in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay . Jamaica set a national record of 37.89 s . Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007 , but Mills felt that Bolt 's technique was much improved , pinpointing improvements in Bolt 's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency , giving him more driving power on the track . = = = World-record breaker = = = The silver medals from the 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt 's desire to run , and he took a more serious , more mature stance towards his career . Bolt continued to develop in the 100 m , and he entered to run in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston . On 3 May 2008 , Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s , with a 1.8 m / s tail wind , improving his personal best from 10.03 s . This was the second-fastest legal performance in the history of the event , second only to compatriot Asafa Powell 's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti , Italy . Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance , praising Bolt 's form and technique especially . Michael Johnson , who was observing the race , said that he was shocked at how quickly he had improved over the 100 m distance . The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time , but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come . Bolt set a new 100 m world record on 31 May 2008 . At the Reebok Grand Prix held in the Icahn Stadium in New York City , Bolt ran 9.72 s with a tail wind of 1.7 m / s . This race was Bolt 's fifth senior 100m . Gay again finished second and said of Bolt : \" It looked like his knees were going past my face . \" Commentators noted that Bolt appeared to have gained a psychological advantage over fellow Olympic contender Gay . In June 2008 , Bolt responded to claims that he was a lazy athlete , saying that the comments were unjustified , and he trained hard to achieve his potential . However , he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event , and chose to not make the effort to train for distance running . Turning his efforts to the 200 m , Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events \u2014 first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava , then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens , Greece . Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances , the acceptance of Bolt 's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer . Bolt was more focused in practice , and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina , in preparation for the Olympics , had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times . = = = 2008 Summer Olympics = = = Bolt announced that he would double-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics , and the new 100 m world-record holder was the favourite to win both . Michael Johnson , the 200 m and 400 m record holder , personally backed the sprinter , saying that he did not believe that a lack of experience would work against him . Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals , respectively . In the Olympic 100 m final , Bolt broke new ground , winning in 9.69 s ( unofficially 9.683 s ) with a reaction time of 0.165 s . This was an improvement upon his own world record , and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson , who finished in 9.89 s . Not only was the record set without a favourable wind ( + 0.0 m / s ) , but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied . Bolt 's coach reported that , based upon the speed of Bolt 's opening 60 m , he could have finished with a time of 9.52 s . After scientific analysis of Bolt 's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo , Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time . Considering factors such as Bolt 's position , acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson , the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55 \u00b1 0.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the finishing line . Bolt stated that setting a record was not a priority for him , and that his goal was just to win the gold medal , Jamaica 's first of the 2008 Games . Olympic medalist Kriss Akabusi construed Bolt 's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating , noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time . IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican 's actions as disrespectful . Bolt denied that this was the purpose of his celebration by saying , \" I wasn 't bragging . When I saw I wasn 't covered , I was just happy \" . Lamine Diack , president of the IAAF , supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory . Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt 's actions , stating , \" We have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them . We have to allow the personality of youth to express itself \" . Bolt then focused on attaining a gold medal in the 200 m event , aiming to emulate Carl Lewis ' double win in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics . Michael Johnson felt that Bolt would easily win gold but believed that his own world record of 19.32 s set at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta would remain intact at the Olympics . Bolt eased through the first and second rounds of the 200 m , jogging towards the end of his run both times . He won his semi-final and progressed to the final as the favourite to win . Retired Jamaican sprinter Don Quarrie praised Bolt , saying he was confident that Johnson 's record could be beaten . The following day , at the final , he won Jamaica 's fourth gold of the Games , setting a new world and Olympic record of 19.30 s . Johnson 's record fell despite the fact that Bolt was impeded by a 0.9 m / s headwind . The feat made him the first sprinter since Quarrie to hold both 100 m and 200 m world records simultaneously and the first since the introduction of electronic timing . Furthermore , Bolt became the first sprinter to break both records at the same Olympics . Unlike in the 100 m final , Bolt sprinted hard all the way to the finishing line in the 200 m race , even dipping his chest to improve his time . Following the race , \" Happy Birthday \" was played over the stadium 's sound system as his 22nd birthday would begin at midnight . Two days later , Bolt ran as the third leg in the Jamaican 4x100 metres relay team , increasing his gold medal total to three . Along with teammates Nesta Carter , Michael Frater , and Asafa Powell , Bolt broke another world and Olympic record , their 37.10 s finish breaking the previous record by three-tenths of a second . Powell , who anchored the team to the finishing line , lamented the loss of his 100 m record to Bolt but showed no animosity towards his Jamaican rival , stating that he was delighted to help him set his third world record . Following his victories , Bolt donated US $ 50,000 to the children of the Sichuan of China to help those harmed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake . Bolt 's record-setting runs caused commentators not only to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential to become one of the most successful sprinters ever . Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals . The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal , Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records , and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals . All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems . Bolt 's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators , including Victor Conte , and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns . The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills ( Bolt 's coach ) and Herb Elliott ( the Jamaican athletics team doctor ) . Elliott , a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission , urged those concerned about the issue to \" come down and see our programme , come down and see our testing , we have nothing to hide \" . Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete , declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner : \" We will test any time , any day , any part of the body ... [ he ] doesn 't even like to take vitamins \" . Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics , and all had tested negative for banned substances . He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean , stating , \" We work hard and we perform well and we know we 're clean \" . I was slowing down long before the finish and wasn 't tired at all . I could have gone back to the start and done it all over again . = = = After the 2008 Olympics = = = The end of the 2008 athletics season saw Bolt compete in the \u00c5F Golden League , beginning in Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich . Despite having the slowest start among his competitors in the 100 m race , he still crossed the finishing line in 9.83 s . Even though the time was slower than both his newly set world record and Asafa Powell 's track record , it was still among the top-fifteen 100 m finishes by any sprinter to that date . Bolt admitted that he was not running at full strength , suffering from a cold , but he had concentrated on both winning the race and finishing the season in good health . At the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne , Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s , equalling Xavier Carter 's track record . However , it was the 100 m final , featuring Asafa Powell , that drew the most interest . Powell had moved closer to Bolt 's world record after setting a new personal best of 9.72 s , reaffirming his status as Bolt 's main contender . Bolt 's final event of the season came three days later at the Golden League final in Brussels . This was the first 100 m race featuring both Bolt and Powell since the final in the Olympics . Both Jamaicans broke the track record , but Bolt came out on top with a time of 9.77 s , beating Powell by 0.06 s . Victory , however , did not come as smoothly as it had in Beijing . Bolt made the slowest start of the nine competitors and had to recover ground in cold conditions and against a 0.9 m / s headwind . Yet the results confirmed Jamaican dominance in the 100 m , with nine of the ten-fastest legal times in history being recorded by either Bolt or Powell . On his return to Jamaica , Bolt was honoured in a homecoming celebration and received an Order of Distinction in recognition of his achievements at the Olympics . Additionally , Bolt was selected as the IAAF Male Athlete of the year and won a Special Olympic Award for his performances . However , he turned his attention to future events , suggesting that he could aim to break the 400 metres world record in 2010 as no major championships were scheduled that year . = = = 2009 Berlin World championships = = = Bolt started the season competing over 400 metres in order to improve his speed , winning two races and registering 45.54 s in Kingston , and windy conditions gave him his first sub-10 second finish of the season in the 100 m in March . In late April Bolt suffered minor leg injuries in a car crash . However , he quickly recovered following minor surgery and ( after cancelling a track meet in Jamaica ) he stated that he was fit to compete in the 150 metres street race at the Manchester Great City Games . Bolt won the race in 14.35 s , the fastest time ever recorded for 150 m . Despite not being at full fitness , he took the 100 and 200 m titles at the Jamaican national championships , with runs of 9.86 s and 20.25 s respectively . This meant he had qualified for both events at the 2009 World Championships . Rival Tyson Gay suggested that Bolt 's 100 m record was within his grasp , but Bolt dismissed the claim and instead noted that he was more interested in Asafa Powell 's return from injury . Bolt defied unfavourable conditions at the Athletissima meet in July , running 19.59 seconds into a 0.9 m / s headwind and rain , to record the fourth fastest time ever over 200 m , one hundredth off Gay 's best time . At the 2009 World Championships in August , Bolt eased through the 100 m heats , clocking the fastest ever pre-final performance of 9.89 seconds . The final was the first time Bolt and Gay had met in the season , and Bolt improved his world record with a time of 9.58 s to win his first World Championship gold medal . Taking over a tenth of a second off the previous best mark , this was the largest ever margin of improvement in the 100 m world record since the beginning of electronic timing . Gay finished with a time of 9.71 s , 0.02 s off Bolt 's 9.69 s world-record run in Beijing . Although Gay withdrew from the second race of the competition , the Jamaican once again produced world record-breaking form in the 200 metres final . He broke his own record by 0.11 seconds , finishing with a time of 19.19 seconds . He won the 200 m race by the biggest margin in World Championships history , even though the race had three other athletes running under 19.90 seconds , the greatest number ever in the event . Bolt 's pace impressed even the more experienced of his competitors ; third-placed Wallace Spearmon complimented his speed , and the Olympic champion in Athens 2004 Shawn Crawford said \" Just coming out there ... I felt like I was in a video game , that guy was moving \u2013 fast \" . Bolt pointed out that an important factor in his performance at the World Championships was his improved start to the races : his reaction times in the 100 m ( 0.146 ) and 200 m ( 0.133 ) were significantly faster than those he had produced in his world record runs at the Beijing Olympics . However , he , together with other members of Jamaican 4x100 m relay team , fell short of their own world record of 37.10 s set at 2008 Summer Olympics by timing 37.31 s , which is , however , a championship record and the second fastest time in history at that date . On the last day of the Berlin Championships , the Governing Mayor of Berlin , Klaus Wowereit , presented Bolt with a 12-foot high section of the Berlin Wall in a small ceremony , saying Bolt had shown that \" one can tear down walls that had been considered as insurmountable . \" The nearly three-ton segment was delivered to the Jamaica Military Museum in Kingston . Several days after Bolt broke the world records in 100 and 200 metres events , Mike Powell , the world record holder in long jump ( 8.95 metres set in 1991 ) argued that Bolt could become the first man to jump over 9 metres , the long jump event being \" a perfect fit for his speed and height \" . At the end of the season , he was selected as the IAAF World Athlete of the Year for the second year running . = = = 2010 Diamond League and broken streak = = = Early on in the 2010 outdoor season , Bolt ran 19.56 seconds in the 200 m in Kingston , Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time , although he stated that he had no record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season . He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix . Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson 's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava . He failed to match Johnson 's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather had left him with an Achilles tendon problem . On his return from injury a month later , Bolt asserted himself with a 100 m win at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne ( 9.82 seconds ) and a victory over Asafa Powell at Meeting Areva in Paris ( 9.84 seconds ) . Despite this run of form , he suffered only the second loss of his career in a 100 m final at the DN Galan . Tyson Gay soundly defeated him with a run of 9.84 to Bolt 's 9.97 seconds , and the Jamaican reflected that he had slacked off in training early in the season while Gay had been better prepared and in a better condition . This marked Bolt 's first loss to Gay in the 100 m , which coincidentally occurred in the same stadium where Powell had beaten Bolt for the first time two years earlier . = = = 2011 World championships = = = Considered the overwhelming favourite to win in the 100 metres at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu , Bolt was eliminated from the final , breaking \" ridiculously early \" according to the starter in an interview for BBC Sport , and receiving a false start . Usain Bolt 's countryman , Yohan Blake , won in a season best of 9.92 seconds . In the 200 m , Bolt cruised through to the final which he won in a time of 19.40s. Bolt also won gold in 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay with team Jamaica setting a world record time of 37.04 . In June 2012 , Usain Bolt won the 100 m race in Diamond League in 9.79 seconds . = = = 2012 Summer Olympics , The Double Triple = = = Before the 2012 Summer Olympics in London , Bolt came in second at the Jamaican trials in both 100 m and 200 m . However , at the Olympics , he won the 100 metres gold medal with a time of 9.63 seconds , setting a new Olympic record for that distance and defending his gold medal from the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics . He was followed by fellow Jamaican , Yohan Blake , who won silver with a time of 9.75 seconds . Following the race , seventh-place finisher Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago declared \" There 's no doubt he 's the greatest sprinter of all time \" , while USA Today referred to Bolt as a Jamaican \" national hero \" , noting that his victory came just hours before Jamaica was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its independence from the United Kingdom . With his 2012 win , Bolt became the first man to defend an Olympic sprint title since Carl Lewis in 1988 . I 'm now a legend . I 'm also the greatest athlete to live . Bolt then \" re-defined everything \" , by following up that impressive performance with a successful defence of his 200 metres gold medal with a time of 19.32 seconds , followed by fellow Jamaicans second-place Yohan Blake at 19.44 and bronze medalist Warren Weir at 19.84 . With this , Bolt became the first man in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles . In fact , Bolt was so comfortably ahead near the finish that he was able to slow down , put his left finger to his mouth and \" tell everyone to shush . \" As soon as Bolt crossed the finish line , he did five push-ups , one for each of his Olympic gold medals . Following the race , eighth-place finisher Anaso Jobodwana of South Africa compared Bolt to a \" ghost \" who \" disappears in front of you \" . When asked about his greatness as a sprinter following his victory , Bolt placed himself in the category of Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali , in their respective sports . International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) President Jacques Rogge initially stated that Bolt was not yet a \" legend \" and would not deserve such acclaim until the end of Bolt 's career , but later called him the best sprinter of all time . On the final day of the 2012 Olympics ' athletics , Bolt participated in Jamaica 's gold medal-winning 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay team consisting of Bolt , Nesta Carter , Michael Frater and Yohan Blake . With a running time of 36.84 seconds , they broke Jamaica 's previous world record of 37.04 from 2011 . He celebrated by doing the \" Mobot \" in tribute to distance runner Mo Farah . = = = 2013 = = = On 6 June 2013 , Justin Gatlin beat Bolt by one-hundredth of a second and won the 100 metres at the Golden Gala meet in Rome , Italy . Bolt appeared at the 2013 London Anniversary Games winning the 100 metres in 9.85 seconds . He also participated in the 4 x 100m relay that was won by Jamaica . On 11 August 2013 , Bolt regained the title as world 's fastest man by winning the World Championships 100m in Moscow , with a time of 9.77s ( \u2212 0.3 m / s wind ) , ahead of Justin Gatlin in second with a time of 9.85s. On 17 August , Bolt won the 200-metre race for his 2nd gold medal of the world championships with a time of 19.66s. Bolt won a third gold in the 4x100 m relay , which made him the most successful athlete in the 30-year history of the world championships . For the fifth time in six years , Bolt was named IAAF World Male Athlete of the Year . = = = 2014 Commonwealth Games = = = An injury to Bolt 's hamstring in March 2014 caused him to miss nine weeks of training . Having recovered from surgery , Bolt competed in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow , Scotland . Bolt said that he was \" ... going there for my fans and I 'm going there to show I 'm getting back into shape and they can look for great things now and for the years to come . \" Bolt and his teammates won the 4x100 relay in 37.58 seconds ; a Commonwealth Games record . In August 2014 Bolt set the indoor 100m world record in Warsaw with a time of 9.98 seconds . Soon afterwards he ended his season early in order to be fit for the 2015 season . = = = 2015 Beijing World championships = = = On 23 August 2015 , Bolt won the final of the 100 metres with a time of 9.79 seconds at the 2015 Beijing World Champions . On 27 August 2015 , Bolt won the 200 metres with a time of 19.55 seconds . = = Personal life = = In his personal life , Bolt expresses a love for dancing and his character is frequently described as laid-back and relaxed . His Jamaican track and field idols include Herb McKenley and former Jamaican 100m and 200m world record holder , Don Quarrie . Michael Johnson , the former 200 m world and Olympic record holder , is also held in high esteem by Bolt . Bolt is Catholic and known for making the sign of the cross before racing competitively , and he wears a Miraculous Medal during his races . His middle name is St. Leo . In 2010 , Bolt also revealed his fondness of music , when he played a reggae DJ set to a crowd in Paris . The first sport to interest Bolt was cricket and he said if he was not a sprinter he would be a fast bowler instead . As a child he was a supporter of the Pakistani cricket team and admired the bowling of Waqar Younis . He is also a fan of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar , West Indian opener Chris Gayle and Australian opener Matthew Hayden . During a charity cricket match Bolt clean-bowled Chris Gayle . Gayle was complimentary of Bolt 's pace and swing . Bolt also struck a six off Chris Gayle 's bowling . Another bowler complimentary of Bolt 's pace was former West Indies fast-bowling great Curtly Ambrose . The Australian cricketer Shane Warne said in 2012 that Bolt would be interested in playing in the cricket Big Bash League , this was later confirmed by Bolt who said that \" [ Shane Warne ] contacted me and asked me about if I am serious and if I really want to do it then he can put in a few words that should get it done .

It 's amazing match , amazing people . Everything is perfect . \" After the match , Federer praised del Potro ; \" I thought he hung in there and gave himself chances and , in the end , was the better man . \" He is the first player since countryman David Nalbandian to defeat Federer at the US Open , and at 198 cm ( 6 ft 6 in ) , he is the tallest ever Grand Slam champion , a record he now shares with Marin \u010cili\u0107 , the 2014 US Open winner . Besides Nadal and Djokovic , del Potro is the only player to defeat Federer in a Grand Slam final , and the first player to defeat both Nadal and Federer in the same Grand Slam tournament . Dick Enberg hosted the post-match ceremony during which a victorious Del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish . Enberg declined the request saying that he was running out of time , but went on to list the corporate sponsored prizes Del Potro won . A couple of minutes later , Del Potro made the same request again , and only then did Enberg relent saying , \" Very quickly , in Spanish , he wants to say hello to his friends here and in Argentina \" . An emotional del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd . Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and broadcaster CBS over the interview . A CBS executive later defended Enberg , noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony . In his first match since the US Open , Del Potro was upset by world no . 189 \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin in straight sets at the Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo .

Also for the third straight year , they played in the finals of the French Open . Nadal won his fourth consecutive French Open title , by a score of 6 \u2013 1 , 6 \u2013 3 , 6 \u2013 0 . The scoreline puts the match among the most one-sided in Grand Slam finals history . Federer suffered from mononucleosis in 2007 and 2008 which seriously inhibited his energy levels and movement through most of the early hard court and clay season , and his fitness and training levels didn 't recover until sometime in 2009 . Nadal and Federer also met in the finals of Wimbledon for the third straight year , in the most anticipated match of their rivalry . Amidst rain delays , they played the longest final in Wimbledon history ( 4 hours and 48 minutes ) , and Nadal captured the title by winning the fifth set in near darkness . This match broke Federer 's Open Era-record 65 match winning streak on grass , which spanned more than five years . = = = 2009 = = = Federer and Nadal played each other only twice in 2009 , splitting their matches . Both players began the year strong , reaching the finals of the Australian Open . This was the first hard-court Grand Slam final for Nadal , but Federer was undefeated in eight hard-court finals ( 5 US Open , 3 Australian ) . The final was a long ( 4 hours and 23 minutes ) and competitive in the first four sets with Nadal pulling away decisively in the fifth set to secure his first hard court championship . Federer rebounded against Nadal at the Madrid Masters ( their first match on Spanish soil ) , defeating him in the final in straight sets . This was a pivotal match because it broke Nadal 's five-match winning streak against Federer . The victory by Federer also ended Nadal 's 33-match winning streak on clay and foreshadowed the Swiss ' historic victory at Roland Garros , which completed his Career Grand Slam . = = = 2010 = = = In 2010 , Federer and Nadal played twice , with Nadal winning the first and Federer winning the second match . The two met in the final of the Madrid Open , one year after their last match , and Nadal defeated Federer in straight sets . Federer and Nadal met in the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals ' final , marking their third meeting at the year-end championships and their first ever meeting in the finals . Federer continued his indoor dominance against Nadal , winning in three sets . This victory gave Federer a record-tying fifth title at the year-end tournament . = = = 2011 = = = Federer and Nadal played four singles matches , with Nadal winning the first three matches and Federer winning the last match . Their lone doubles match was at the BNP Paribas Open . Federer , partnering with Stanislas Wawrinka , defeated Nadal and Marc L\u00f3pez in the semifinals . In their first singles match of 2011 , the two met in the semifinals of the Miami Masters , where Nadal won in straight sets . They met in the semifinal at the Mutua Madrid Open , and Nadal won in three sets . They then met in the finals of the 2011 French Open , their first Grand Slam meeting since the 2009 Australian Open final . Although it was a competitive match , Nadal again defeated Federer in four sets to win his tenth Major title and sixth French Open crown . Their final meeting of the year came in the round-robin stage of the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals . Their match , a rematch of the previous year 's final , saw Federer win a lopsided match in straight sets . = = = 2012 = = = Federer and Nadal first met during 2012 in the semifinals of the 2012 Australian Open . Federer was leading by a set and a break before a 20-minute fireworks delay , due to the celebrations of Australia Day , changed the momentum of the match . Nadal improved his hard-court record over Federer with a win in four sets . They next met in the semifinals of the Indian Wells Masters , where Federer won the match in straight sets en route to claiming his fourth Indian Wells Masters title . In August 2012 , Nadal revealed his doubt that he would be able to play in the 2012 US Open because of a knee injury which had prevented him from playing since Wimbledon . Federer expressed concern for Nadal , and Nadal ultimately withdrew . = = = 2013 = = = Federer and Nadal met four times in 2013 with Nadal prevailing on every occasion against a severely hampered Federer due to two serious back injuries sustained during the 2013 season . Federer and Nadal met for the first time during the quarterfinals of the Indian Wells Masters . It is the earliest the pair have met in a tournament since 2004 . Federer entered the match having suffered a back injury in the previous round and was defeated in straight sets . On 1 April , by winning the Miami Masters , Andy Murray passed Federer in the ATP Rankings for second place . This marked the first time since 10 November 2003 , that neither Federer nor Nadal was ranked in the ATP top 2 , a span of an unprecedented 490 weeks . Nadal then defeated Federer in the 2013 Rome Masters final in two sets . They finally played a match at the 2013 Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati , where Nadal unseated the five-time champion in the quarterfinals after Federer played a dazzling first set with crisply struck groundstrokes . At several points Federer had openings in Nadal service games in the second set , including a 0 \u2013 30 chance , but Nadal came back to win in three sets . Federer had been hampered by a back injury during most of the summer and had just switched back to his old racquet after experimenting with a larger frame in his previous two tournaments . Nadal and Federer met in semi finals of the indoor event , 2013 ATP World Tour Finals in the O2 arena . Nadal beat Federer in straight sets . This would be Federer 's last career match played with his 90-inch racquet before permanently upgrading to a larger frame . = = = 2014 \u2013 2015 = = = Federer and Nadal had their only meeting of the 2014 season in the semi finals of the Australian Open . Nadal won in straight sets and improved his record to 3 \u2013 0 against Federer at the Australian Open ( 9 \u2013 2 overall in majors ) . This was the first Grand Slam tournament ( and only second tournament overall ) that Federer played after switching to a new larger racquet for the first time in his career . In November 2015 , Federer defeated Nadal in 3 sets at the final of the Swiss Indoors , this was their first encounter on Swiss soil , as Federer captured a 7th title in his hometown of Basel . It was Federer 's first victory over Nadal in over 3 and a half years , having lost the previous 5 meetings . = = Analysis = = = = = Significant aspects = = = The rivalry between Federer and Nadal has been a huge part of both men 's careers . Their Grand Slam tournament histories are of particular interest , especially their all-time record of eight finals encounters . This includes playing French Open and Wimbledon finals for three consecutive years ( 2006 \u2013 08 ) , culminating in what is widely considered the greatest match in tennis history at Wimbledon 2008 . Nadal , who had to defeat Federer during each of his first six Grand Slam title runs , possesses a 6 \u2013 2 advantage in their finals encounters plus three victories in semifinals . Nadal denied Federer a Career Grand Slam plus two potential Calendar Year Grand Slams ( 2006 \u2013 07 ) by defeating him at the French Open every year from 2005 \u2013 08 . Federer would complete a Career Grand Slam by winning the French title in 2009 after Nadal was upset in the fourth round . Meanwhile , Federer twice denied Nadal from becoming the first man since Bj\u00f6rn Borg in 1980 to win the \" Channel Slam \" ( both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year ) by defeating him in their first two Wimbledon finals , but Nadal succeeded the following year . This was the first of three combined Channel Slams with Federer accomplishing it in 2009 followed by Nadal 's second in 2010 . Federer has also prevented Nadal from winning the Year End Championships by defeating him in the 2010 finals and eliminating Nadal from the tournament in the 2006 , 2007 , and 2013 semifinals preventing Nadal from becoming only the second man after Andre Agassi to win a Career Grand Slam , a gold singles Olympic medal , and the Year End Championships , a distinction dubbed as a \" Career Super Slam \" by Sports Illustrated . Their record six consecutive calendar years atop the rankings from 2005 \u2013 10 was due to their unprecedented combined performance in the Grand Slam and Masters Series tournaments . During this span they captured a combined record 21 of the 24 Grand Slam tournament titles ( 12 for Federer , 9 for Nadal ) , including a record 11 consecutive titles from 2005 \u2013 07 . They also dominated the Masters Series , combining for 31 of the 54 titles ( 18 for Nadal , 13 for Federer ) , including 8 of 9 in 2005 ( 4 each ) . Additionally , Federer won 4 of 6 year-end tournaments . Finally , both men not only possess Open era records for consecutive wins on a single surface \u2014 Federer on both grass ( 65 ) and hard courts ( 56 ) , Nadal on clay courts ( 81 ) \u2014 but each of these streaks was broken by the other man . Their respective dominance on grass and clay was the impetus for the \" Battle of Surfaces \" , an exhibition match on a half-grass , half-clay court , which Nadal won in May 2007 when both the grass and clay streaks were still active . Nearly half of the meetings between Federer and Nadal have come on clay which is statistically Nadal 's best surface and one of Federer 's weaker surfaces . Of their 34 matches , 15 have been on clay , 16 have been on hard court , and 3 have been on grass . Federer has a winning record on his best surface , grass ( 2 \u2013 1 ) , while Nadal leads on clay ( 13 \u2013 2 ) and hard court ( 9 \u2013 7 ) . Nadal leads in Grand Slam Tournament matches ( 9 \u2013 2 ) , with five of these wins coming on the clay courts of Roland Garros . On hard courts and grass , Federer holds an edge in overall career win percentage , but trails Nadal in head-to-head results on hard courts . Analysts , commentators and pundits increasingly recognize that Nadal is just a bad matchup for Federer as the heavy topspin created by Nadal 's groundstrokes combined with his strategy of directing the majority of his serves & groundstrokes to Federer 's single handed backhand keeps Federer on the defensive and making it harder for Federer to use his aggressive groundstrokes to dominate baseline rallies as he typically does against other opponents . Federer says he is a \" different player due to Nadal 's presence \" citing Nadal 's game as a major reason for improvements in areas of his own game . Two factors that the Nadal head-to-head advantage is built on include domination on clay and domination during two seasons when Federer was hobbled by illness and injury . The 13 \u2013 2 record on clay masks a close record of 10 \u2013 9 on all other surfaces . Also Nadal 's 8 \u2013 0 advantage in 2008 and 2013 , when Federer was clearly hindered by mononucleosis and severe back injuries respectively , distorts a competitive 15 \u2013 11 record in all other years . = = = Comparison of Grand Slam tournament titles = = = As of 2015 , Roger Federer holds the all-time record for the most Grand Slam tournament titles with 17 . Federer 's Grand Slam tournament titles include 9 on hard courts , 7 on grass , and 1 on clay . Nadal has 14 in total : 9 on clay , 3 on hard courts , and 2 on grass . Both players have won the Career Grand Slam ( winning all four majors at least once ) . = = = Comparison of Year-End Championships = = = As of 2016 , Roger Federer holds the record for Year-End Championship titles with 6 . While Nadal has not won a Year-End Championship , he has made the finals twice , in 2010 and 2013 . Federer defeated Nadal in the 2010 finals , 6-3 , 3-6 , 6-1 and leads Nadal 4-1 at the event . = = = Comparison of Masters 1000 titles = = = Rafael Nadal holds 28 Masters 1000 titles , with 20 of his titles on clay and 8 on hard courts . Roger Federer has 24 , with 18 coming on hard courts and 6 on clay . Nadal is missing three Masters 1000 titles ( Miami , Shanghai , and Paris ) and Federer is missing two ( Monte Carlo , and Rome ) . Nadal prevented Federer from winning Monte Carlo three times from 2006 to 2008 . He also beat Federer twice in the Rome finals , once in 2006 and again in 2013 . The 2006 Rome final , which was won by Nadal in a 5th-set tiebreak , lasted for over five hours and is considered by some to be one of the greatest and most memorable matches ever contested on clay . In 2005 , Federer prevented Nadal from winning Miami in a five-set final . Nadal won the first and second sets , was up a break in the third set and was two points away from victory before Federer came back from two-sets-down to win . Nadal made it back to the Miami final in 2008 , 2011 , and 2014 but lost each time . = = = Head-to-head tallies = = = The following is a breakdown of their head-to-head results : All matches : Nadal , 23 \u2013 11 All finals : Nadal , 14 \u2013 7 Grand Slam matches : Nadal , 9 \u2013 2 Australian Open : Nadal , 3 \u2013 0 French Open : Nadal , 5 \u2013 0 Wimbledon : Federer , 2 \u2013 1 US Open : Have not met Grand Slam finals : Nadal , 6 \u2013 2 Tennis Masters Cup / ATP World Tour Finals matches : Federer , 4 \u2013 1 Tennis Masters Cup / ATP World Tour Finals finals : Federer , 1 \u2013 0 ATP Masters Series / ATP World Tour Masters 1000 matches : Nadal , 12 \u2013 4 ATP Masters Series / ATP World Tour Masters 1000 finals : Nadal , 7 \u2013 3 ATP World Tour 500 / ATP International Series Gold matches : Tied , 1 \u2013 1 ATP World Tour 500 / ATP International Series Gold finals : Tied , 1 \u2013 1 Best of five set matches : Nadal , 11 \u2013 3 Five-set matches : Nadal , 3 \u2013 2 Winning the match after losing 1st set : Nadal , 6 \u2013 2 Best of three set matches : Nadal , 12 \u2013 8 Outdoor courts : Nadal , 22 \u2013 6 Indoor courts : Federer , 5 \u2013 1 Tie-breaks : Nadal , 11 \u2013 10 = = = Head-to-head results on each court surface = = = Clay courts : Nadal , 13 \u2013 2 Hard courts : Nadal , 9 \u2013 7 Outdoor : Nadal , 8 \u2013 2 Indoor : Federer , 5 \u2013 1 Grass courts : Federer , 2 \u2013 1 = = = = Clay = = = = Nadal and Federer have played 15 of their 34 matches on clay with Nadal holding a 13 \u2013 2 advantage over Federer . From 2005 to 2008 , Nadal won every French Open , defeating Federer in each of those tournaments ( in the 2005 semifinal and the 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2011 finals ) , and won at least 2 of the 3 clay Masters events each year from 2005 \u2013 2010 , defeating Federer in 6 of those . Statistically , Nadal has the highest win percentage on clay of any player in ATP history . As a result , some analysts and players , such as Pat Cash and Conchita Mart\u00ednez , consider Nadal the greatest clay-court player ever . Nadal has won all of their seven meetings in best of five set matches on clay . = = = = Grass = = = = Federer has won the Wimbledon Championships seven times , and Nadal has won the championships twice . Five of Federer 's titles were consecutive titles ( from 2003 to 2007 ) , and the sixth and seventh titles were won in 2009 and 2012 . Federer and Nadal met in three consecutive Wimbledon finals from 2006 to 2008 ; Federer won the first two finals , while Nadal won the last one . The 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts . = = = = Hard = = = = Nadal and Federer have played 16 of their 34 matches on hard courts , with Nadal holding a 9 \u2013 7 lead . An important distinction is the relative success of the two players on indoor and outdoor hard courts . In the former , Federer leads Nadal with a 5 \u2013 1 record , while on outdoor hard courts , Nadal leads 8 \u2013 2 . The quicker conditions and low bounce of the indoor hard courts fit Federer 's style , while the slower and high bouncing conditions of most outdoor ones favor Nadal . Federer has defeated Nadal in four out of five encounters they have had at the Year End Championships , including the 2010 final , which are played on indoor hardcourts . Despite Nadal 's success on hard courts , some analysts have criticized his lack of consistency in reaching tournament finals ( especially the U.S.Open finals ) for skewing the overall head-to-head results . Nadal has said that Federer is the \" favourite \" on \" these kinds of surfaces \" ( referring to their match at the 2012 Australian Open ) . = = = Skill comparisons = = = Federer is considered by many to be the greatest tennis player of all time while Nadal 's performance on clay has prompted many experts to regard him as the greatest clay court player and one of the best tennis players of all time . Federer has been more successful than Nadal on fast courts because he hits a flatter forehand and has a faster serve . Grass and indoor hard courts are one of the faster surfaces , so Federer 's flatter shots there result in a lower bouncing , faster moving trajectory . Thus , Nadal 's topspin is less effective on such faster courts , but is most effective on slower courts such as clay . Nadal has improved his serving speed and placement over the years , but Federer still serves faster on average and earns more aces and service winners , while Nadal has an overall stronger ground stroke game . While Nadal is statistically weaker than Federer on both hard and grass courts , Nadal has nonetheless achieved considerable success on both surfaces , including notable wins at the 2008 Summer Olympics , Wimbledon ( 2008 and 2010 ) , the Australian Open ( 2009 ) , the US Open ( 2010 and 2013 ) , and at various hard court Masters series tournaments . = = = Media and player commentary = = = During interviews , many fellow and former players have regarded both Federer and Nadal as among the best tennis players of all time . In November 2010 , former player Bj\u00f6rn Borg stated that he believed Federer to be the greatest player of all time , but \" Rafa has the chance to be the greatest player \" if he stays healthy . Former player and commentator John McEnroe was of a similar opinion , noting in 2010 that \" there is an argument to be made that Rafael Nadal may be the greatest player eventually , even possibly now . \" He has subsequently adjusted his opinion on several occasions , in 2013 noting that he thought Nadal was \" the greatest player that ever lived \" but later in 2014 bunched Federer , Nadal , Laver and Sampras together as the greatest ever . In July 2015 , he reversed his opinion and again backed Roger Federer for the title . At the press conference following his 9th record French Open win in 2014 and a total of 14 Slams , three shy of Federer 's 17 , Nadal said that he really does not care much about records , \" I 'll follow my own path . Then , when my career is over , then we 'll count . \" In May 2014 , eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi told Singapore 's Straits Times newspaper , via aljazeera.com : \" I 'd put Nadal number one and Federer number two . Federer separated himself from the field for four years . He separated himself from Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt . Nadal had to deal with Federer , Novak Djokovic , Andy Murray in the golden age of tennis . \" In November 2014 , former world number 1 player Andy Roddick , in noting his support for Federer , explained why he believes that head-to-head results are not a valid factor in determining the greatest of all time , \" For me Roger Federer is still ahead in the greatest-ever debate , with Rafael Nadal second . People talk about their head-to-head being the determining factor , but I can \u2019 t comprehend a single match-up being the deciding factor . It \u2019 s about total wins at major tournaments , not an individual match-up , in my mind . \" In December 2014 , Rafael Nadal 's uncle and coach , Toni Nadal , indicated to Spanish radio station Cadena COPE that he believed Federer to be the greatest of all time based on overall statistics and achievements , noting \" I think he is ( the best of all-time ) , the numbers say so . \" In March 2015 , former player Pete Sampras made similar arguments about Federer , \" You look at the numbers of what he \u2019 s been able to do , you have to say he \u2019 s the greatest we \u2019 ve seen \" These comments were echoed by Boris Becker in July 2015 , \" Great respect for Roger Federer ! He is our greatest of all time \" = = Relationship and competitive dynamic = = Both Federer and Nadal 's personal and professional relationship is good-natured and gracious . Though they are both highly competitive , they maintain a healthy regard for each other and have had virtually no source of personal animosity . The two have made slight criticisms of one another in the past , nevertheless . For example , Federer complained of Nadal 's slow , deliberate style of play on the eve of the 2008 Wimbledon final . Nadal criticized Federer before the 2012 Australian Open for his failure to be more vocal about players ' grievances on issues such as scheduling and prize money . He subsequently apologized for making his views public , however , and both players maintained that they still enjoyed a good relationship and had high respect for each other , which can often be seen in interviews . Nadal was also once seen watching Federer play a match in his box , and their family members would congratulate each other on match wins . Despite their cordial relationship , both men have a somewhat different attitude towards their rivalry . When Federer was securely atop the tennis world he was ambivalent towards the notion of a rivalry with an opponent five years younger than himself . But after their memorable 2008 Wimbledon final he had no choice but to acknowledge its significance , even admitting \" it definitely becomes more and more special the more times we play against each other . \" A few weeks later , after Nadal had officially surpassed him in the rankings , Federer offered this compliment : \" Look at what he had to achieve to get it . That 's what I like to see . \" Nadal has always cherished the rivalry because he looks up to Federer as both a role model and a measuring stick for success . When interest in their rivalry increased , both Federer and Nadal collaborated to arrange occasional charity exhibition matches to benefit their charities ' philanthropic interests . The most recent was the Match for Africa , played on 21 December 2010 in Zurich , Switzerland , which Federer won , and a follow-up match played in Madrid on the following day , titled \" Joining Forces for the Benefit of Children \" , which Nadal won . = = = Cultural impact = = = The rivalry has also increased overall interest in tennis . The highly anticipated 2008 Wimbledon final drew strong television ratings for tennis in both the U.S. and across Europe . The match was also featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated , which was the first time in years that tennis had made its cover . = = Pairing Federer and Nadal = = = = = Significant achievements = = = From the 2003 Wimbledon Championships to the 2011 French Open , Federer and Nadal have won an unprecedented 26 out of 32 Major titles . In this time , both men have also completed the Career Grand Slam ( Nadal has also completed the Career Golden Slam by winning the 2008 Beijing Olympics ) . From Nadal 's first Grand Slam tournament victory at the 2005 French Open until the 2011 French Open , Federer and Nadal had won 22 of 25 Major titles ( 12 for Federer , 10 for Nadal ) . The exceptions were the 2008 and 2011 Australian Open , won by Novak Djokovic , and the 2009 US Open , won by Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro . Federer and Nadal are the only No. 1 and No. 2 pair in the open era to contest the French Open and Wimbledon men 's finals back to back in a calendar year . They are also the only pair in the history of tennis to contest both of these finals back to back for three consecutive years ( 2006 \u2013 08 ) . In the history of tennis , Federer and Nadal are the only pair to face each other in eight Grand Slam singles finals ( 2006 \u2013 08 Wimbledon , 2006 \u2013 08 , 2011 French Open , 2009 Australian Open ) . This broke the previous record of seven finals set by Bill Tilden and William Johnston ( 1919 \u2013 25 U.S. Championships ) . Their match at the 2012 Australian Open also marked a record 10th time two players had faced each other in Grand Slam men 's singles matches , tying with the record set by John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl . This record has now been surpassed by Federer-Djokovic when they met for the 11th time in a Major at the 2012 Wimbledon semi-finals . Federer and Nadal are the only No. 1 and No. 2 pair to win 11 consecutive Grand Slam singles tournaments between them ( from the 2005 French Open to the 2007 US Open ) . In this period , Federer won 3 consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open and 2 consecutive titles at the Australian Open , while Nadal won 3 consecutive French Open titles . During the open era , only two pairs of players have played each other in the final of the same Grand Slam singles tournament three consecutive years : Becker \u2013 Edberg ( 1988 \u2013 90 Wimbledon ) and Federer-Nadal ( 2006 \u2013 08 French Open and 2006 \u2013 08 Wimbledon ) . Federer and Nadal are the only pair to win at least four consecutive finals at three different Majors during the same period ( 2005 \u2013 08 and 2010 \u2013 14 French Open for Nadal , 2003 \u2013 07 Wimbledon and 2004 \u2013 08 US Open for Federer ) . From the 2004 Wimbledon Championships to the 2011 French Open , at least one of them appeared in 25 of 28 Major finals , winning all of them except the 2005 Australian Open , the 2008 Australian Open , the 2011 Australian Open , and the 2009 US Open . Federer and Nadal have combined to win 8 consecutive Wimbledon ( 2003 \u2013 10 ) and 10 consecutive French Open ( 2005 \u2013 14 ) . Federer and Nadal won the French Open , Wimbledon and US Open trio for 4 consecutive years ( 2005 \u2013 08 ) . One of only two pairs to have faced each other in a Major , having both already completed the career Grand Slam . They achieved this in ( the 2011 French Open final and the 2012 Australian Open semifinal ) .

This was a charity tennis match for the Fundaci\u00f3n Rafa Nadal ( Rafael Nadal Foundation ) . On 1 January 2011 they played in the final of the knockout exhibition tournament ; the Mubadala World Tennis Championship on a hard court . Federer had beaten S\u00f6derling in the previous round and Nadal had beaten Berdych in the previous round . Nadal won the encounter by a score of 7 \u2013 6 ( 7 \u2013 4 ) , 7 \u2013 6 ( 7 \u2013 3 ) . On 8 March 2011 the two played a set at Matthew Knight Arena in Eugene , Oregon , USA .

He took up the sport because his father was the vice president of his local curling club . Martin first came on the curling scene in 1985 when his Alberta team of Richard Feeney , Dan Petryk and Michael Berger won the Canadian Junior Championships in their first year together as a team . The rink ( a group of players ) finished the round robin in second place , with a win-loss record of 7 \u2013 4 , behind Prince Edward Island 's Kent Scales . This forced them into a semifinal against the third place Quebec rink , skipped by Steve Gagnon .

The team went undefeated through the round robin and won their semifinal match against Sweden . However , in the final , they came up short , losing 7 \u2013 6 to the Scottish team skipped by David Aitken . = = = Early career = = = Five years out of the World Junior Championships , Martin had formed a new team and won his first provincial championship .

After beating Norway 's Eigil Ramsfjell in the semifinal , Martin 's team lost in the final , losing to Scotland 's David Smith with a score of 2 \u2013 7 . His 1991 Brier victory also earned him a spot at the 1992 Winter Olympics , where curling was just a demonstration sport at the time . Martin won all three of his round robin games before losing the semifinal to Switzerland with a score of 4 \u2013 8 and losing to the United States with a score of 2 \u2013 9 in the bronze medal match .

However , in the semifinal , the Ontario rink , skipped by Russ Howard , defeated Martin 's team by 7 \u2013 4 . Martin 's first World Curling Tour event was the 1993 Players ' Championship , then known as the \" Seagrams VO Cup \" . His first WCT event win came the following season at the 1993 Kelowna Cashspiel . Later that season he won the 1994 Players ' Championship , which has been retroactively considered his first Slam win , even through the event occurred long before the Grand Slam series began . = = = 1995 \u2013 1999 = = = After his two Brier seasons , Martin did not win the provincial title again until 1995 . In the meantime , he had made some line-up changes in his team , and by the 1995 Labatt Brier , he had settled on James Pahl as his second , retaining Park and Bartlett as his third and lead , respectively . At the 1995 Brier , he placed in third after the round robin with a 7 \u2013 4 win-loss record , tied with Ontario and Prince Edward Island .

In the semifinal , Martin rebounded with a win over Quebec , but the rematch against Stoughton in the final resulted in a loss in an extra end , which Stoughton stole after a light draw by Martin to win the game 8 \u2013 7 . In 1996 , Broda was replaced by Rudy Ramcharan on the team . With his new team , Martin won another provincial title , and at the 1997 Labatt Brier , he once again finished the round robin with a 10 \u2013 1 win-loss record . His only loss came to the undefeated Vic Peters rink of Manitoba . However , Martin met and defeated Peters twice in the playoffs , including winning the final with a score of 10 \u2013 8 . With this win , Martin won his second Brier and the right to go to the 1997 Ford World Men 's Curling Championship . Martin topped the round robin at the Worlds , with a 7 \u2013 2 win-loss record , but lost to Sweden in the semifinal with a score of 6 \u2013 4 and then to Scotland in the bronze medal match with a score of 8 \u2013 4 . In 1997 , Martin looked to represent Canada at the Olympics once again . The 1998 Winter Olympics would mark the first time curling would be an official medal sport at the games . At the 1997 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials , Martin 's rink finished with a 6 \u2013 3 win-loss record , tied in second place with Ed Werenich . Martin knocked off Werenich in the semifinal but lost to the then little known Mike Harris in the final with a score of 6 \u2013 5 . For the next few years , Martin would fail to make it back to the Brier . In 1998 , Martin won his second Players ' Championship of his career , then known as the \" Apolla World Curling Tour Championship \" . = = = 1999 \u2013 2006 = = = In 1999 , Martin dropped Ramcharan , who was embroiled by a scandal where he botched organizing a bonspiel , and replaced him with Carter Rycroft , an upstart junior curler . In 2000 , Martin won his sixth provincial title . However , the 2000 Labatt Brier would be a flop for the team , which finished with a 6 \u2013 5 win-loss record out of the playoffs . That season , Martin won his third Players ' Championship . Following a failed bid to win the 2001 Alberta championship , the team then boycotted the Brier , as prominent curling teams of the day wanted to focus more on the World Curling Tour , while the Canadian Curling Association scheduled events conflicting with major WCT events . In the meantime , however , Martin still had his sights set on an Olympic championship . The team went to the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials and finished first after the round robin with a 7 \u2013 2 win-loss record . That gave the team a bye to the finals , which Martin won by defeating Kerry Burtnyk with a score of 8 \u2013 7 .

The two teams kept the game fairly even , but in the final end , Martin had a simple draw against one Norway rock to win , which he missed , giving Trulsen the win with a score of 6 \u2013 5 . As a result , Norway clinched the gold medal , and Martin , representing Canada , won his third international silver . Due to the boycott , Martin 's rink would not win another provincial title until 2006 . In the meantime , the team had amassed five Grand Slam titles and won the 2005 Canada Cup of Curling . Martin played in his third Canadian Olympic Trials in 2005 . The event was a disappointment for the team , which finished with a 4 \u2013 5 record . However , later in the season , they made it to the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier , Martin 's first Brier appearance in six years . The team finished the round robin tied in second place with an 8 \u2013 3 record . However , in the page playoff 3 vs. 4 game , Martin 's rink was edged by Nova Scotia 's Mark Dacey 8 \u2013 7 .

The team had disappointed at the 2005 Trials , had not won a single Grand Slam title in the 2005 \u2013 06 season , and topped it off by finishing fourth at the Brier . Martin replaced Walchuk , Rycroft and Bartlett with World Junior Champion skip John Morris at third , Marc Kennedy at second and Ben Hebert at lead . His new team won the 2007 Alberta provincials , and at their first Brier , the team finished the round robin with an 8 \u2013 3 win-loss record in second place , tied with Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador . The new team struggled at the 2007 Brier in Hamilton , and lost in the 3 vs. 4 game to Jeff Stoughton , 6 \u2013 3 . Despite their Brier failure , however , the season was a success on the World Curling Tour , where they won three of the four Grand Slams . During the 2006 \u2013 07 and 2007 \u2013 08 curling seasons , Martin and his team won an unprecedented five consecutive Grand Slams , three in the 2006 \u2013 07 season and two in the 2007 \u2013 08 season . The team won their second straight provincials in 2008 , sending them to the 2008 Tim Hortons Brier . On March 13 , 2008 , Martin 's team from Alberta became the first team since 2003 to go through the round robin at the Tim Hortons Brier undefeated . They finished the round robin with a perfect 11 \u2013 0 win-loss record . They knocked off Saskatchewan 8 \u2013 7 in the 1 vs. 2 game , and then beat rival and defending champion Glenn Howard of Ontario 5 \u2013 4 in the final .

This was the first time Kevin Martin won a gold medal at an international curling event . The Martin rink finished the 2007 \u2013 08 season with two more Grand Slam titles . Due to his Brier and World Championship successes in 2008 , the Canadian Curling Association selected Kevin Martin 's team ( along with Jennifer Jones , Kevin Koe and Stefanie Lawton ) to be Canada 's representatives on \" Team North America \" at the 2008 Continental Cup of Curling . The 2008 \u2013 09 season would be almost as successful for Martin . He once again qualified for the Brier , winning the Alberta provincial championship , and then once again went 13 \u2013 0 in the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier . He knocked off Glenn Howard 7 \u2013 6 followed by Jeff Stoughton in the final by a 7 \u2013 4 result .

Martin rebounded with a tight semifinal victory over Switzerland , but had to face Scotland in a third matchup in the final . The game was tied going into the last end with Martin having the last rock advantage . Before his first rock , Martin was lying one in a complicated setup . After spending about six minutes trying to decide which shot to try , he went against the wishes of his teammates and threw away his shot , forcing Scotland 's David Murdoch to make a double-tap to sit shot .

He was an instrumental part of the group that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling . In the early 2000s , he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of curling , represented largely by the World Curling Tour , which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by corporate sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments . The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier , but also the growth of the Grand Slam , and in doing so , ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport . The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself , as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay . = = Career statistics = = = = = Grand Slam record = = = = = = Teams = = = = = = Awards = = = World Junior Curling Championships All-Star skip : 1986 Hec Gervais Award ( Brier MVP ) : 1997 , 2009 Brier Shot of the Week Award : 1997 Brier first all-star team skip : 1996 , 2008 , 2009 Brier second all-star team skip : 2006 , 2007 World Curling Tour ( WCT ) MVP : 2008 \u2013 09 WCT Team of the Year : 2008 \u2013 09 WCT MVP : 2009 \u2013 10 = = Personal life = = Martin is married to Shauna Martin and has three children , Karrick , Kalycia , and Mykaela .

She played in two World Championships , and for the women 's basketball team at Louisiana State in the late 1980s , wearing the number 15 , the number Jackson wears in her mother 's honour . She was one of the first Australians to play in the American collegiate system , where she was known for her aggressive style of play and was nicknamed \" the assassin \" . Her parents continued to play basketball locally on the social level when Lauren and her brother were young , and her family had a basketball court in their backyard when Jackson was growing up . Her grandfather played for the Western Suburbs Magpies . Jackson grew up in Albury , where she attended Murray High School . She earned her Higher School Certificate in Canberra while she was training with the Australian Institute of Sport . Jackson studied for a psychology degree at Lomonosov Moscow State University and continued via correspondence from America . In 2007 she was working on a university course in business management . When she finishes her playing career , Jackson wants to become a basketball administrator . She said \" Where I put my time and energy is now crucial . I want to get involved in the political side of sport rather than the media and I need to learn from the people who have been there before . \" In 2010 , she was taking classes at Macquarie University in Sydney . Her course work was centred in cultural studies and included topics like women 's rights and racism . Injuries have prevented her from studying around 2010 , but in 2012 , she was back working on her degree , and her aspirations have included becoming a United Nations diplomat . She has also considered becoming an advocate for women . Her interests regarding gender studies were inspired by a book regarding the rape during the Rwandan Genocide , and Jackson is even an embassador of a foundation that seeks to empower the abused women of that war . As a youngster , Jackson was active in other sports . She was involved in athletics at school and played tennis , which she gave up because competitions conflicted with her ability to play basketball . Similarly , she played on her school netball team , until the age of 14 , giving it up because of basketball commitments . In the off season , Jackson trains by pumping weights . Jackson is 195 centimetres ( 77 in ) tall . She was this tall by the time she turned 16 , after she gained 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) in height when she was 15 years old . = = Celebrity = = By 2003 , she was being recognised around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan . She said of her private life : \" I don 't really have a private life . I 've found it difficult as an athlete , to maintain a relationship . It 's not one of my best points but I 've got family and friends who compensate for that . When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun , and there were moments when people criticised me for that , and you know what , I 'm young , I 'm going to do that , and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn 't care . \" She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons : First , she gets recognised by too many people . Second , everyone wants to comment on her height . In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies , internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved . These rumours were incorrect . Jackson said of them : \" When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like , ' Oh ... My ... God ! When I tell you we were in hysterics ... because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind . A 7 foot 8 Chinese man ? That 's just not my thing . I really respect him as a player . And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top . I 'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person . I guess the Chinese people don 't do that stuff very often , so the cultural [ differences ] was a big thing . But I don 't care . You have to laugh about things or you 'll be crying , which I would probably have been doing anyway [ because of the loss and surgery ] . I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time . \" She partied a fair amount in her early 20s . By 2010 , she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5 : 30 am any more because she lacked the stamina . When people google Jackson , some of the first search results feature her in the nude . Jackson said of this : \" Instead of being known for my basketball skills , all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see . \" She posed nude in an Australian magazine , Black + White , that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics . The expensively printed magazine / book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and , by the 2004 edition , was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its \" artistic \" approach to nude photography , and its equal coverage of male and female athletes , although it did create a stir in the United States . She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue . Of posing nude , she said , \" if offered the opportunity , I think that it 's a personal decision . Whether you do it for the money or whatever , again , I think it 's a personal decision . I don 't know whether I would say yes or no . I guess you cross that bridge when you come to it . I don 't think it 's a bad thing , I 'm not against it . \" Jackson has had multiple injuries . In 2008 , after the Olympics , she had surgery to fix her ankle . In 2009 , she had two stress fractures in her back . In December 2010 , she had an Achilles injury . She sustained the injury playing in Australia . Between January 2011 and February 2012 , she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries . She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail , Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic . She said of the surgery : \" This is a really , really tough decision , but after talking with my doctors and my family , we felt that immediate surgery is the best course of action . With something painful like this hip injury , I want to be especially proactive . I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible . My goal is to be at full strength by the end of the season . \" She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery . Afterwards , Jackson injured her right knee , requiring surgery in 2012 . Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years , including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected . All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson 's retirement in March . Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction , as \" I don 't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life . \" As Jackson got older , she took on a more activist role , working for domestic violence charities and helping children from Australia 's outback get involved in sport . In December 2002 , she helped launch the Smith Family Toy Drive at the Canberra Centre with the help of Ainslie school children . She is the patron for the NSW Rape Crisis Centre . She is passionate about preventing domestic abuse . In 2010 , she visited young basketball players at Batemans Bay 's Moruya Basketball . = = Basketball = = Lauren is the most famous basketball player in Australia , a position she reached by 2003 . Prior to this , Australia 's most famous player was Michelle Timms , Australia 's first player of either gender to play internationally . She was recognised as one of the world 's best basketball players by the time she was 21 . She has been described as Australia 's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O 'Neal , and the best female basketball player in the world . She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world : \" I don 't really think about it . Nobody really talks to me like that . It 's not something I 'm conscious of . My family and people who have known me all my life , they see me for who I am , and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me . They know I have to train , but the rest of it is really laid-back . \" Jackson plays two positions , forward and centre , and has the ability to make jump shots and spinning bank shots . = = = Early career = = = Jackson started playing basketball at the Albury Sports Centre when she was four years old .

Her team made it to the Grand Final one year , and she played in the match despite having hurt her knee . She was upset after the event . In response to this , her parents sat down with her and explained she did not need to continue to play if she did not want to . Following this conversation , she went to her room and typed a message on her computer that said \" from this day on , nothing will stand in my way ... \" When she was 14 years old , she led her New South Wales side to a national championship gold . Her performance in the tournament attracted the attention of the national team selectors . Tom Maher said of the game : \" Right then and there , I said , ' Is this the best thing I 've ever seen ? ' It was just unbelievable . Those old guys had seen a lot of basketball , and they were drooling . \" As a competitor at the 1999 Australian Under-20 national championships , she won the Bob Staunton Award for the tournament MVP . She was described as a basketball prodigy by the time she was seventeen years old . She has played with Robyn Maher , Michelle Timms and Shelley Gorman . Jackson admires them . They all won bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics . Jackson had a rivalry with American basketball player Lisa Leslie . Both women dislike each other , a dislike that goes back to when Jackson was on tour in the United States with the Opals as a 16-year-old . The rivalry intensified in 2000 at the Olympics in the gold medal match when Jackson accidentally pulled off Leslie 's hair extension when Jackson was trying to grab a rebound . Jackson treated the incident as a joke , saying \" It was something to joke about even though we lost the gold medal . \" Leslie did not feel the same way about the extension pulling incident . The rivalry continued when Jackson transitioned to the WNBA and her Seattle Storm team played Leslie 's Los Angeles Sparks , who at the time were the best team in the league . The rivalry was so intense that their coaches had to coach around it , sometimes choosing to keep one off the floor when the other was on . The coaches feared if they left the players on the floor together , their own player would foul out in an attempt to get the best of the other player . Leslie and Jackson have played together as team members in the WNBA 's All-Star game .

She returned in September and helped the Storm in two blowout wins against the Tulsa Shock , but then an injury sustained during the Olympic preparations sidelined Jackson for three games . Upon her return on 21 September , Jackson became the fourth WNBA player to reach 6,000 points . Jackson wound up playing just 167 minutes on the regular season . The Storm saw an early playoff exit in their series against the Minnesota Lynx , with Jackson attempting a buzzer beater in the third game but falling short . This turned out to be Jackson 's final game in the WNBA . = = = = 2013-Retirement = = = = A hamstring surgery forced Jackson out of the 2013 season , and she also missed the 2014 season after operating both her right knee and left Achilles in February . The final year of her Storm contract was suspended in 2013 and dissolved under the new collective-bargaining agreement signed in 2014 , but Seattle still retained Jackson 's rights . During her 2014 recovery , Jackson expressed interest in returning to Seattle in 2015 , saying that despite so much time sidelined by injury , \" I \u2019 ve just had too good of a career there to let that fall by the wayside . \" However , these hopes of returning to the WNBA and the Storm for the 2015 season were sidelined when Jackson had further surgery on her right knee in the spring of 2015 . Her attentions turned to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro . However , in November 2015 , Jackson announced that her rehabilitation had suffered a setback that would keep her from practicing until January 2016 . Upon taking the court again , she stated she would decide in February 2016 if she would participate in what would be her fifth Olympic games or retire from the sport . Her retirement was announced one month later . = = = = WNBA career statistics = = = = = = = = = Regular season = = = = = = = = = = Postseason = = = = = = = = WNBL = = = The Women 's National Basketball League ( WNBL ) was founded the year Jackson was born . Between 1998 and 2008 , she played a total of 154 WNBL games , winning one championship with the Australian Institute of Sport ( AIS ) and four more with the Canberra Capitals . Jackson was offered a scholarship with the AIS in 1996 , when she was just 15 , but her parents said no to this , as it required her to move from Albury to Canberra . The next year , she accepted a scholarship . The programme considers her one of its success stories . With Jackson leading a side composed of the best 16- to 17-year-old development players in the country , the Australian Institute of Sport WNBL team won the WNBL Championship . Jackson joined the Canberra Capitals for the 1999 season when she turned 18 , and played with the team off and on until 2006 . While with the team , she won four WNBL championships . In 1999 / 2000 , the Canberra Capitals who won the league championship in a finals match against Adelaide where they had a final score of 67 \u2013 50 . She played for the Canberra Capitals for the 2002 / 2003 season . In a November game in Penrith with a temperature of 40 \u00b0 C ( 104 \u00b0 F ) against the Sydney Flames , 500 people largely showed up to watch her play . This season , she was coached by Carrie Graf . In the Penrith game , she scored 9 of the Capital 's first 13 points . She finished the game with 29 points , 16 rebounds and 5 blocks , with her team winning 79 \u2013 67 . In a December 2002 against the Australian Institute of Sport , she scored 33 points . After home games in Canberra , Jackson would hang out with her teammates at Tilley 's Devine Cafe . In a December 2002 game against the Townsville Fire in Townsville was moved to the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre , which seated 5,000 people instead of at the Fire 's normal 800 seat stadium , because it was felt Jackson would draw that large a crowd . She did , with 4,110 people showing up to the game and setting a regular season attendance record for the Fire . Canberra lost the match , with Townsville figuring a way to contain Jackson , limiting her to 23 points , which was six below her average of 29 points per game so far in that the season . At the time , the attendance was the best ever for a regular season WNBL game , with only two Grand Finals games in the post season having more people in attendance . In the 2002 / 2003 season , she was one of only three players who were taller than 190 centimetres ( 75 in ) . She played with the Capitals in the Women 's World Cup 2003 where she averaged 30.6 points per game and 11.4 rebounds . She also won the WNBL Grand Final as a member of the Capitals , and was named the Most Valuable Player in the Grand Finals match . During the 2003 / 2004 season , she scored 48 points in a single October 2003 game . This was her highest individual game point total at the time and is her single highest WNBL point scoring game . Jackson returned to the Capitals for the last half of the 2009 / 2010 season . The Capitals started an effort to re-sign Jackson , and in March 2011 , she signed a contract for a million dollars to play in the WNBL . This was the most an Australian woman had ever been offered to play for a domestic side in the country , with most of the top women earning only $ 50,000 a year . Despite returning to Australia and being present at every Capitals game , injuries prevented Jackson from playing in the 2012 \u2013 13 NBDL season . For the 2013 \u2013 14 season , the Capitals missed the deadline date to sign Jackson and led her to play in China instead . Jackson was signed for the Capitals ' next two seasons , and expected to join the team in November 2014 , after recovering from a hip surgery she went through in September . Jackson 's return happened in December 19 against the Adelaide Lightning . Jackson managed to play five more games in the 2014 \u2013 15 WNBL season , losing only one as she averaged 13 points and seven rebounds . Still her physical ailments prevented Jackson from training with her teammates , and requiring weekly drainings of synovial fluid out of her knee . During a double-header road trip in Victoria , Jackson 's knee gave in . A subsequent MRI scan showed further damage to her knee that required new surgeries , forcing Jackson to sit out the rest of the season . The Capitals released Jackson from her contract in January 2016 . = = = China 2013 = = = After missing the 2013 WNBA season and with a deal with Canberra Capitals falling through , in September 2013 Jackson signed with the Heilongjiang Shenda of the Women 's Chinese Basketball Association . She helped Heilongjiang qualify to the playoffs with an average of 22 points , 9.5 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game , but a heel injury made Jackson lose the post-season . Another injury during the season , where Jackson \" pulled my meniscus out of the root of my bone \" was not deemed too grave at the time , but the knee problems would escalate during the following years . = = = National team = = = Jackson made the Australian under-20 team when she was only 14 years old . She was first called up to the senior national team when she was 16 years old . Her national team coaches Tom Maher and Carrie Graf say positive things about Jackson to the press and others but they rarely have said those things to Jackson . This is a strategy designed to help motivate Jackson to play better . Tom Maher who was the coach her called her up said \" She 's so good she could be the greatest sportswoman in the world . She 's that extraordinary . \" Graf has described Jackson as one of the superstars of the game . Jackson was a member of the 1997 Australian Junior Women 's Team that won a silver medal at the World Championships in Brazil . At the time , she was 16 years old . She averaged 14.3 points per game and 9.9 rebounds per game . She was also a member of the 1998 Australian Senior Women 's Team that won a bronze medal at the World Championships in Germany . At the time , she was 16 years old and the youngest Australian woman ever to be named to the team . In the tournament , she averaged 10.9 points per game and 3.9 rebounds per game . She was a key part of the team 's success . She was coached in the tournament by Tom Maher . She came off the bench to play . In the Olympic test tournament in the lead up to the 2000 Summer Olympics , Jackson scored 18 points and 10.7 rebounds per game . She was a member of the 2000 Summer Olympics team that won a silver medal . At the 2000 Games , she scored 127 total points , had 23 total blocked shots , 12 steals and 67 rebounds . She averaged 15.9 points and 8.4 rebounds per game . In the 76 \u2013 54 loss in the gold medal game , she scored 24 points and had 13 rebounds . She led the team in points scored and total rebounds . Going into the Olympics , her team was ranked third in the world . At the Sydney Games , she was coached by Tom Maher . The gold medal final was against the United States . Jackson was a member of the Australian Senior Women 's Team that won a silver medal in the World Championships in China in 2002 . She averaged 23.1 points a game in the competition and was named to the All-Star team for the tournament . She averaged 5.4 rebounds per game . In a semi-final match against the United States , Jackson fouled Lisa Leslie three times in the first six minutes of the game . The team lost while Jackson spent most of the time on the bench . By January 2003 , Jackson had played over 100 games with Australia 's senior side . She competed in the 2003 World Championships and was named the International Basketball Federation 's Most Valuable Player . At the FIBA Diamond Ball Tournament for Women 2004 , she averaged 22.7 points and 14.0 rebounds per game . Jackson was a member of the Australian senior team that won a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics , where she averaged 22.9 points and 10.0 rebounds per game . The gold medal final was against the United States . In 2006 , she was a co-captain with Jenny Whittle of the Australian women 's senior team that won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games . She played in the preliminary final against the Mozambique women 's national basketball team , and the gold deal match against New Zealand . Jackson was the captain of the Australian women 's senior team that won a gold medal at the World Championships in Brazil in 2006 that beat Russia in the Gold Medal match . This was the first time Australia had ever earned gold in the event . Jackson averaged 21.3 points and 8.9 rebounds per game . While the national team is called The Opals , Jackson asked Basketball Australia if they were to make rings for team members in honour of their win , if they would use diamonds instead of opals . As captain of the 2008 Summer Olympics Australian women 's team that won a silver medal at the Olympics , Jackson averaged 17.3 points and 8.6 rebounds per game . In the FIBA Diamond Ball Tournament for Women 2008 , Jackson averaged 20.3 points per game and 5.0 rebounds per game . In 2010 , she was a member of the senior women 's national team that competed at the World Championships in the Czech Republic . She averaged 13.4 points per game and 7.9 rebounds per game . Jackson missed the first training camp for the 2012 Summer Olympics squad in March , but was back by April to train with the team . In June , Jackson tore her adductor magnus muscle during the Australian training camp in the Czech Republic . She was one of the models for the 2012 Australian Olympic team uniforms , and chosen to carry the Australian Flag during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Olympic Games . The hamstring injury prevented Jackson from getting much play during the Olympic tournament , having only had significant court time in the matches against USA and the bronze medal play-off with Russia . After flying to Australia in February 2014 to operate on her heel and knee , Jackson committed to return to the Opals in time for the 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women . However , the delayed recovery of Jackson 's knee led her to give up on the tournament to have her right hip operated on to fix a torn labrum in September 2014 . She had gotten the tear while playing for Ros Casares Valencia in 2012 but went without surgery to not miss the then-upcoming Olympics . Jackson would later express interest in attending her fifth Olympic tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics as a way to close her career , while also pursuing her long-standing dream of a gold medal . However , while attending the Opals training camp in Canberra , she announced her retirement saying her conditions were not improved enough and she needed an \" absolute miracle \" to get into shape . = = Honours = = Jackson was named the Australian International Player of the year in 1999 , 2000 and 2002 . In 2005 , she was inducted into the Australian Institute of Sport ' Best of the Best ' . In late 2011 , the Albury Sports Stadium was renamed the Lauren Jackson Sports Centre . A thousand people showed up at the renaming ceremony , at which Jackson was the guest of honour . She was the flag bearer for Australia at the Summer 2012 London Olympic Games . On 8 June 2015 , she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Queen 's Birthday Honours .",

                    "text": "Wilt Chamberlain = Wilton Norman \" Wilt \" Chamberlain ( August 21 , 1936 \u2013 October 12 , 1999 ) was an American basketball player . He played for the Philadelphia / San Francisco Warriors , the Philadelphia 76ers , and the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) ; he played for the University of Kansas and also for the Harlem Globetrotters before playing in the NBA . The 7 foot 1 inch Chamberlain weighed 250 pounds as a rookie before bulking up to 275 and eventually to over 300 pounds with the Lakers . He played the center position and is widely considered one of the greatest and most dominant players in NBA history . Chamberlain holds numerous NBA records in scoring , rebounding , and durability categories . He is the only player to score 100 points in a single NBA game or average more than 40 and 50 points in a season . He also won seven scoring , eleven rebounding , nine field goal percentage titles and led the league in assists once . Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average at least 30 points and 20 rebounds per game in a season , a feat he accomplished seven times . He is also the only player to average at least 30 points and 20 rebounds per game over the entire course of his NBA career . Although he suffered a long string of professional losses , Chamberlain had a successful career , winning two NBA championships , earning four regular-season Most Valuable Player awards , the Rookie of the Year award , one NBA Finals MVP award , and being selected to 13 All-Star Games and ten All-NBA First and Second teams . Chamberlain was subsequently enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978 , elected into the NBA 's 35th Anniversary Team of 1980 , and chosen as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History of 1996 . Chamberlain was known by various nicknames during his basketball playing career . He hated the ones that called attention to his height such as \" Goliath \" and \" Wilt the Stilt \" , which was coined during his high school days by a Philadelphia sportswriter . He preferred \" The Big Dipper \" , which was inspired by his friends who saw him dip his head as he walked through doorways . After his basketball career ended , Chamberlain played volleyball in the short-lived International Volleyball Association , was president of this organization , and is enshrined in the IVA Hall of Fame for his contributions . Chamberlain was also a successful businessman , authored several books , and appeared in the movie Conan the Destroyer . He was a lifelong bachelor , and became notorious for his claim to have had sexual intercourse with as many as 20,000 women . = = Early years = = Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , into a family of nine children , the son of Olivia Ruth Johnson , a domestic worker and homemaker , and William Chamberlain , a welder , custodian , and handyman . He was a frail child , nearly dying of pneumonia in his early years and missing a whole year of school as a result . In his early years Chamberlain was not interested in basketball , because he thought it was \" a game for sissies \" . Instead , he was an avid track and field athlete : as a youth , he high jumped 6 feet , 6 inches , ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1 : 58.3 , put the shot 53 feet , 4 inches , and broad jumped 22 feet . But according to Chamberlain , \" basketball was king in Philadelphia \" , so he eventually turned to the sport . Because Chamberlain was a very tall child , already measuring six feet at age 10 and six feet 11 inches when he entered Philadelphia 's Overbrook High School , he had a natural advantage against his peers ; he soon was renowned for his scoring talent , his physical strength and his shot blocking abilities . According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock , Chamberlain was \" scary , flat-out frightening ... before he came along , most basketball players were mortal-sized men . Chamberlain changed that . \" It was also in this period of his life when his three lifelong nicknames \" Wilt the Stilt \" , \" Goliath \" , and his favorite , \" The Big Dipper \" , were allegedly born . = = High school career = = As a player for the Overbrook Panthers , Chamberlain averaged 31 points a game during the 1953 high school season and led his team to a 71-62 win against the Northeast High School of his future NBA teammate Guy Rodgers . He scored 34 points , won Overbrook the Public League title and a berth for the Philadelphia city championship game against the winner of the rival Catholic league , West Catholic . In that game , West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain the entire game , and despite the center 's 29 points , the Panthers lost 54-42 . In his second Overbrook season , Chamberlain continued his prolific scoring , among them scoring a high school record 71 points against Roxborough . The Panthers comfortably won the Public League title after again beating Northeast in which Chamberlain scored 40 points , and later won the city title by defeating South Catholic 74-50 . Chamberlain scored 32 points and led Overbrook to a flawless 19 \u2013 0 season . During summer vacations Chamberlain worked as a bellhop in Kutsher 's Hotel . Subsequently , owners Milton and Helen Kutsher kept up a lifelong friendship with Wilt , and according to their son Mark , \" They were his second set of parents . \" Red Auerbach , the coach of the Boston Celtics , spotted the talented teenager at Kutscher 's and had him play 1-on-1 against Kansas University standout and national champion , B. H. Born , elected the Most Valuable Player of the 1953 NCAA Finals . Chamberlain won 25-10 ; Born was so dejected that he gave up a promising NBA career and became a tractor engineer ( \" If there were high school kids that good , I figured I wasn 't going to make it to the pros \" ) , and Auerbach wanted Chamberlain to go to a New England university , so he could draft him as a territorial pick for the Celtics , but Chamberlain did not respond . In Chamberlain 's third and final Overbrook season , he continued his high scoring , once logging 74 , 78 and 90 points in three consecutive games . The Panthers won the Public League a third time , beating West Philadelphia 78-60 , and in the city championship game , they met West Catholic once again . Scoring 35 points , Chamberlain led Overbrook to an easy 83-42 victory . After three years , Chamberlain had led Overbrook to two city championships , logged a 56 \u2013 3 record and broken Tom Gola 's high school scoring record by scoring 2,252 points , averaging 37.4 points per game . After his last Overbrook season , over 200 universities wanted to recruit the basketball prodigy . Among others , UCLA offered Chamberlain the opportunity to become a movie star , the University of Pennsylvania wanted to buy him diamonds , and Chamberlain 's Panthers coach Mosenson was even offered a coaching position if he could persuade the center . In his 2004 biography of Chamberlain , Robert Cherry has described that Chamberlain wanted a change and therefore did not want to go to or near Philadelphia ( also eliminating New York ) , was not interested in New England , and snubbed the South because of segregation ; leaving the Midwest . In the end , after visiting the University of Kansas with renowned college coach Phog Allen , Chamberlain then proclaimed he was going to play college basketball at Kansas . = = College career = = In 1955 , Chamberlain joined KU . At KU , Chamberlain became a player for the Kansas Jayhawks freshman team under coach Phog Allen , whom he admired , and also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity , where he was the president of his pledge class . Announced as \" looking lighter than his 240 pounds , [ able to ] reach 9 ' 6 \" up in the air [ flatfooted ] , and [ with a wingspan of ] 7 ' 2 \" , his debut was highly anticipated , and he delivered : in Chamberlain 's debut game for the freshman squad , the freshman Jayhawks were pitted against the varsity Jayhawks , who were favored to win their conference that year . Chamberlain dominated his older college mates by scoring 42 points ( 16 \u2013 35 from the field , 10 \u2013 12 on free throws ) , grabbing 29 rebounds and registering four blocks . Chamberlain 's prospects of playing under Allen ended , however , when the coach turned 70 shortly after and was forced to retire by KU regulation . Chamberlain had a bad relationship with Allen 's successor , Dick Harp , fueled by resentment and disappointment : Cherry has doubted whether Chamberlain would have chosen KU if he had known that Allen was going to retire . On December 3 , 1956 , Chamberlain made his varsity debut . In his first varsity game the center scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds , breaking both all-time Kansas records in an 87 \u2013 69 win against the Northwestern team of future NBA teammate Joe Ruklick . Teammate Monte Johnson testified to his athleticism : \" Wilt ... had unbelievable endurance and speed ... and was never tired . When he dunked , he was so fast that a lot of players got their fingers jammed [ between Chamberlain 's hand and the rim ] . \" Reportedly , Chamberlain also broke Johnny Kerr 's toe with a slam dunk . By this time , Chamberlain had developed several offensive weapons that became his trademarks : his finger roll , his fade-away jump shot , which he could also hit as a bank shot , his passing and his shot-blocking . Leading a talented squad of starters , including Maurice King , Gene Elstun , John Parker , Ron Lonesky and Lew Johnson , the Jayhawks went 13 \u2013 1 until they lost a game 56 \u2013 54 versus Oklahoma State , who held the ball the last three and a half minutes without any intention of scoring a basket , which was still possible in the days before the shot clock ( introduced 1984 in the NCAA ) . As he did at Overbrook , Chamberlain again showcased his diverse athletic talent . He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9 seconds , shot-putted 56 feet , triple jumped more than 50 feet , and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years . In 1957 , 23 teams played for the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship . The Midwest regional tourney was held in Dallas , Texas , which at the time was segregated . In the first game , the Jayhawks played the all-white SMU team , and KU player John Parker later said : \" The crowd was brutal . We were spat on , pelted with debris , and subjected to the vilest racial epithets possible . \" KU won 73 \u2013 65 in overtime , after which police had to escort the Jayhawks out . The next game against Oklahoma City was equally unpleasant , with KU winning 81 \u2013 61 under intense racist abuse . In the semi-finals , Chamberlain 's Jayhawks handily defeated the two time defending national champion San Francisco , 80 \u2013 56 , with Wilt scoring 32 points , grabbing 11 rebounds , and having at least seven blocked shots . ( Game film is unclear whether an 8th block occurred , or the ball just fell short due to Chamberlain 's withering defensive intimidation ) . Chamberlain demonstrated his growing arsenal of offensive moves , including jump shots , put-backs , tip-ins , and his turnaround jump shot . He was far more comfortable and effective at the foul line than he would later be during his pro career . He had outstanding foot speed throughout the game , and several times led the fast break , including blocking a shot near the basket and then outracing the field for a layup . His stellar performance led Kansas to an insurmountable lead , and he rested on the bench for the final 3 : 45 remaining in the game . Chamberlain made the First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the Tar Heels of North Carolina . In that game , Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain . For the tip-off , he sent his shortest player , Tommy Kearns , in order to rattle Chamberlain , and the Tar Heels spent the rest of the night triple-teaming him , one defender in front , one behind , and a third arriving as soon as he got the ball . With their fixation on Chamberlain , the Jayhawks shot only 27 % from the field , as opposed to 64 % of the Tar Heels , and trailed 22 \u2013 29 at halftime . Later , North Carolina led 40 \u2013 37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game : they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket . After several Tar Heel turnovers , the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation . In the first overtime each teams scored two points , and in second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return , keeping the game tied at 48 . In the third overtime , the Tar Heels scored two consecutive baskets , but Chamberlain executed a three-point play , leaving KU trailing 52 \u2013 51 . After King scored a basket , Kansas was ahead by one point , but then Tar Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots . For the final play , Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post . The pass was intercepted , however , and the Tar Heels won the game . Nonetheless , Chamberlain , who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds , was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four . Cherry has speculated , however , that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain 's life , because it was the first time that his team lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats . Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life . In Chamberlain 's junior year ( 1957 \u2013 58 NCAA season ) , the Jayhawks ' matches were even more frustrating for him . Knowing how dominant Chamberlain was , the opponents resorted to freeze-ball tactics and routinely used three or more players to guard him . Teammate Bob Billings commented : \" It was not fun basketball ... we were just out chasing people throwing the basketball back and forth . \" Nevertheless , Chamberlain averaged 30.1 points for the season and led the Jayhawks to an 18 \u2013 5 record , losing three games while he was out with a urinary infection : because KU came second in the league and at the time only conference winners were invited to the NCAA tourney , the Jayhawks ' season ended . It was a small consolation that he was again named an All-American , along with future NBA Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Oscar Robertson plus old rival Guy Rodgers . Having lost the enjoyment from NCAA basketball and wanting to earn money , he left college and sold the story named \" Why I Am Leaving College \" to Look magazine for $ 10,000 , a large sum when NBA players earned $ 9,000 in a whole season . In two seasons at Kansas , Chamberlain averaged 29.9 points and 18.3 rebounds per game while totaling 1,433 points and 877 rebounds , and led Kansas to one Big Seven championship . By the time Chamberlain was 21 , he had already been featured in Time , Life , Look , and Newsweek magazines , even before he turned professional . For many years following Chamberlain 's departure from the University of Kansas , critics claimed that he either wanted to leave the very white Midwest or was embarrassed by not being able to bring home the NCAA basketball tournament victory . In 1998 , Chamberlain returned to Allen Field House in Lawrence , Kansas to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his # 13 . Around this time , he has been quoted as saying : \" There 's been a lot of conversation , since people have been trying to get my jersey number retired , that I have some dislike for the University of Kansas . That is totally ridiculous . \" = = Professional career = = = = = Harlem Globetrotters ( 1958 \u2013 1959 ) = = = After his frustrating junior year , Chamberlain wanted to become a professional player before finishing his senior year . However , at that time , the NBA did not accept players who had not finished their last year of studies . Therefore , Chamberlain was prohibited from joining the NBA for a year , and decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for a sum of $ 50,000 ( equal to about $ 410,000 today ) . Chamberlain became a member of the Globetrotters team which made history by playing in Moscow in 1959 , enjoyed a sold out tour of the USSR and prior to the start of a game at Moscow 's Lenin Central Stadium , were greeted by the General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev . One particular Trotter skit involved Trotters captain Meadowlark Lemon collapsing to the ground , and instead of helping him up , Chamberlain threw him several feet high up in the air and caught him like a doll . \" [ Chamberlain ] was the strongest athlete who ever lived \" , the 210-pound Lemon later recounted . In later years , Chamberlain frequently joined the Trotters in the off-season and fondly recalled his time there , because he was no longer jeered at or asked to break records , but just one of several artists who loved to entertain the crowd . On March 9 , 2000 , Chamberlain 's number 13 was retired by the Trotters . = = = Philadelphia / San Francisco Warriors ( 1959 \u2013 1965 ) = = = On October 24 , 1959 , Chamberlain finally made his NBA debut , starting for the Philadelphia Warriors . Chamberlain immediately became the NBA 's best paid player , earning $ 30,000 ( equal to about $ 244,000 today ) in his rookie contract ; in comparison , the previous top earner was Bob Cousy of the Boston Celtics with $ 25,000 ; in fact , Gottlieb bought the whole Warriors franchise for $ 25,000 seven years earlier . In the 1959 \u2013 60 NBA season , Chamberlain joined a Warriors squad that was coached by Neil Johnston and contained Hall-of-Fame guards Tom Gola and Paul Arizin , plus Ernie Beck and his old rival , Guy Rodgers ; remarkably , all five starters were Philadelphians . In his first NBA game , against the New York Knicks , the rookie center scored 43 points and grabbed 28 rebounds . In his fourth game , Philadelphia met the reigning champions , the Boston Celtics of Hall-of-Fame coach Red Auerbach , whose offer Chamberlain had snubbed several years before , and Bill Russell , who was now lauded as one of the best defensive pivots in the game . In what was the first of many Chamberlain-Russell match-ups , Chamberlain outscored Russell with 30 points versus 28 points , but Boston won the game . Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis would grow to become one of the NBA 's greatest on-court rivalries of all time . Nevertheless , the two also became friends off the court , similar to later rivals Magic Johnson and Larry Bird . In his first NBA season , Chamberlain averaged 37.6 points and 27 rebounds , convincingly breaking the previous regular-season records . He needed only 56 games to score 2,102 points , which broke the all-time regular season scoring record of Bob Pettit , who needed 72 games to score 2,101 points . Chamberlain broke eight NBA records , and was named NBA MVP and Rookie of the Year that season , a feat matched only by fellow Hall-of-Famer Wes Unseld in the 1968 \u2013 69 NBA season . Chamberlain capped off his rookie season by winning the 1960 NBA All-Star Game MVP award with a 23-point , 25-rebound performance for the East . However , it also became evident that he was an atrocious free-throw shooter , making hardly half of his foul shots . As time progressed , Chamberlain grew even worse , and acknowledged he was simply a \" psycho case \" on that matter . The Warriors entered the 1960 NBA Playoffs and beat the Syracuse Nationals , setting up a meeting versus the Eastern Division champions , the Boston Celtics . Cherry described how Celtics coach Red Auerbach ordered his forward Tom Heinsohn to commit personal fouls on Chamberlain : whenever the Warriors shot foul shots , Heinsohn grabbed and shoved Chamberlain to prevent him from running back quickly ; his intention was that the Celtics would throw the ball in so fast that the prolific shotblocker Chamberlain was not yet back under his own basket , and Boston could score an easy fastbreak basket . The teams split the first two games , but in Game 3 , Chamberlain got fed up with Heinsohn and punched him . In the scuffle , Wilt injured his hand , and Philadelphia lost the next two games . In Game 5 , with his hand healthy , Chamberlain scored 50 points . But in Game 6 , Heinsohn got the last laugh , scoring the decisive basket with a last-second tip-in . The Warriors lost the series 4 \u2013 2 . The rookie Chamberlain then shocked Warriors ' fans by saying he was thinking of retiring . He was tired of being double- and triple-teamed , and of teams coming down on him with hard fouls . Chamberlain feared he might lose his cool one day . Celtics forward Heinsohn said : \" Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... he took the most brutal pounding of any player ever \" . In addition , Chamberlain was seen as a freak of nature , jeered at by the fans and scorned by the media . As Chamberlain often said , quoting coach Alex Hannum 's explanation of his situation , \" Nobody loves Goliath . \" Eddie Gottlieb coaxed Chamberlain back into the NBA , sweetening his return with a salary raise to $ 65,000 ( equal to about $ 520,000 today ) . The following season , Chamberlain surpassed his rookie season statistics as he averaged 38.4 points and 27.2 rebounds per game . He became the first player to break the 3,000-point barrier and the first and still only player to break the 2,000-rebound barrier for a single season , grabbing 2,149 boards . Chamberlain also won his first field goal percentage title , and set the all-time record for rebounds in a single game with 55 . Chamberlain was so dominant on the team that he scored almost 32 % of his team 's points and collected 30.4 % of their rebounds . Chamberlain again failed to convert his play into team success , this time bowing out against the Syracuse Nationals in a three-game sweep . Cherry noted that Chamberlain was \" difficult \" and did not respect coach Neil Johnston , who was unable to handle the star center . In retrospect , Eddie Gottlieb remarked : \" My mistake was not getting a strong-handed coach .... [ Johnston ] wasn 't ready for big time . \" In Chamberlain 's third season , the Warriors were coached by Frank McGuire , the coach who had masterminded Chamberlain 's painful NCAA loss against the Tar Heels . In that year , Wilt set several all-time records which have never been threatened . In the 1962 season , he averaged 50.4 points and grabbed 25.7 rebounds per game . On March 2 , 1962 , in Hershey , Pennsylvania , Wilt scored 100 points , shot 36 of 63 from the field , and made 28 of 32 free throws against the New York Knicks . Chamberlain 's 4,029 regular-season points made him the only player to break the 4,000-point barrier ; the only other player to break the 3,000-point barrier is Michael Jordan , with 3,041 points in the 1986 \u2013 87 NBA season . Chamberlain once again broke the 2,000-rebound barrier with 2,052 . Additionally , he was on the hardwood for an average of 48.53 minutes , playing 3,882 of his team 's 3,890 minutes . Because Chamberlain played in overtime games , he averaged more minutes per game than the regulation 48 ; in fact , Chamberlain would have reached the 3,890-minute mark if he had not been ejected in one game after picking up a second technical foul with eight minutes left to play . His extraordinary feats in the 1962 season were later subject of the book Wilt , 1962 by Gary M. Pomerantz ( 2005 ) , who used Chamberlain as a metaphor for the uprising of Black America . In addition to Chamberlain 's regular-season accomplishments , he scored 42 points in the 1962 NBA All-Star Game , still the all-time record . In the 1962 NBA Playoffs , the Warriors met the Boston Celtics again in the Eastern Division Finals , a team which Bob Cousy and Bill Russell called the greatest Celtics team of all time . Each team won their home games , so the series was split at three after six games . In a closely contested Game 7 , Chamberlain tied the game at 107 with 16 seconds to go , but Celtics shooting guard Sam Jones hit a clutch shot with two seconds left to win the series for Boston . In later years , Chamberlain was criticized for averaging 50 points , but not winning a title . In his defense , Warriors coach Frank McGuire said \" Wilt has been simply super-human \" , and pointed out that the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer , a playmaker , and a second big man to take pressure off Chamberlain . In the 1962 \u2013 63 NBA season , Eddie Gottlieb sold the Warriors franchise for $ 850,000 ( equal to about $ 6.65 million today ) to a group of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco , and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under a new coach , Bob Feerick . This also meant , however , that the team broke apart , as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia , and Tom Gola was homesick , requesting a trade to the lowly New York Knicks halfway through the season . With both secondary scorers gone , Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats , averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year . Despite his individual success , the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs . In the 1963 \u2013 64 NBA season , Chamberlain got yet another new coach , Alex Hannum , and was joined by a promising rookie center , Nate Thurmond , who eventually entered the Hall of Fame . Ex-soldier Hannum , who later entered the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach , was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing . Most importantly , he was not afraid to stand up to the dominant Chamberlain , who was known to \" freeze out \" ( not communicate with ) coaches he didn 't like . Backed up by valuable rookie Thurmond , Chamberlain had another good season with 36.9 ppg and 22.3 rpg , and the Warriors went all the way to the NBA Finals . In that series they succumbed to Russell 's Boston Celtics yet again , this time losing 4 \u2013 1 . But as Cherry remarked , not only Chamberlain , but in particular Hannum deserved much credit because he had basically had taken the bad 31 \u2013 49 squad of last year plus Thurmond and made it into a NBA Finalist . In the summer of 1964 Chamberlain , one of the prominent participants at the famed Rucker Park basketball court in New York City , made the acquaintance of a tall , talented 17-year-old teenager who played there . Soon , the young Lew Alcindor was allowed into his inner circle , and quickly idolized the ten-year older NBA player . Unfortunately , Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , as Alcindor would name himself later , would develop an intensely personal antipathy . In the following 1964 \u2013 65 NBA season , the Warriors got off to a terrible start and ran into financial trouble . At the 1965 All-Star break Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers , the new name of the relocated Syracuse Nationals . In return the Warriors received Paul Neumann , Connie Dierking , Lee Shaffer ( who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors ) , and $ 150,000 ( equal to about $ 1.13 million today ) . When Chamberlain left the Warriors , owner Franklin Mieuli said : \" Chamberlain is not an easy man to love [ and ] the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him . Wilt is easy to hate [ ... ] people came to see him lose . \" = = = Philadelphia 76ers ( 1965 \u2013 1968 ) = = = After the trade Chamberlain found himself on a promising Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer , a future Hall-of-Famer , and talented role players Larry Costello , Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson . Cherry remarks that there was a certain tension within the team : Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority , and Jackson , a talented center , was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot ; however , as the season progressed , the three began to mesh better . Chamberlain did not care for the Sixers ' coach , Dolph Schayes , because Schayes , according to him , had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA . Statistically , Chamberlain was again outstanding , posting 34.7 ppg and 22.9 rpg for the second half of the season . After defeating the Cincinnati Royals led by Oscar Robertson in the 1965 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers met Chamberlain 's familiar rival , the Boston Celtics . The press called it an even matchup in all positions , even at center , where Bill Russell was expected to give Chamberlain a tough battle . Indeed , the two teams split the first six games , and because of the better season record , the last game was held in the Celtics ' Boston Garden . In that Game 7 , both centers were marvelous : Chamberlain scored 30 points and 32 rebounds , and Russell logged 16 points , 27 rebounds and eight assists . In the final minute , Chamberlain hit two clutch free throws and slam dunked on Russell , bringing Boston 's lead down to 110 \u2013 109 with five seconds left . Russell botched the inbounds pass , hitting a guy-wire over the backboard and giving the ball back to the Sixers . Coach Schayes called timeout , and decided to run the last play over Hal Greer rather than Chamberlain , because he feared the Celtics would intentionally foul him because he was a poor foul shooter . But when Greer attempted to inbound the ball , John Havlicek stole it to preserve the Celtics ' lead . For the fifth time in seven years , Russell 's team deprived Chamberlain of the title . According to Chamberlain , that was the time that people started calling him \" loser \" . Additionally , in an April 1965 issue of Sports Illustrated Chamberlain conducted an interview entitled \" My Life in a Bush League \" where he criticized his fellow players , coaches , and NBA administrators . Chamberlain later commented that he could see in hindsight how the interview was instrumental in damaging his public image . In the 1965 \u2013 66 NBA season the Sixers experienced tragedy when Ike Richman , the Sixers ' co-owner as well as Chamberlain 's confidant and lawyer , died of a coronary . The Sixers would post a 55 \u2013 25 regular season record , and for his strong play , Chamberlain won his second MVP award . In that season , the center again dominated his opposition by recording 33.5 points and 24.6 rebounds a game , leading the league in both categories . In one particular game , Chamberlain blocked a dunk attempt by Gus Johnson so hard that he dislocated Johnson 's shoulder . Off the court , however , Chamberlain 's commitment to the cause was doubted , as Chamberlain was a late sleeper , lived in New York and preferred to commute to Philadelphia rather than live there , and he was only available during the afternoon for training . Because Schayes did not want to risk angering his best player , he scheduled the daily workout at 4 pm ; this angered the team , who preferred an early schedule to have the afternoon off , but Schayes just said : \" There is no other way . \" Irv Kosloff , who now owned the Sixers alone after Richman 's death , pleaded to him to move to Philadelphia during the season , but he was turned down . In the 1966 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers again met the Celtics , and for the first time had home-court advantage . However , Boston easily won the first two games on the road , winning 115 \u2013 96 and 114 \u2013 93 ; Chamberlain played within his usual range , but his supporting cast shot under 40 % . This caused sports journalist Joe McGinnis to comment : \" The Celtics played like champions and the Sixers just played . \" In Game 3 , Chamberlain scored 31 points and 27 rebounds for an important road win , and the next day , coach Schayes planned to hold a joint team practice . However , Chamberlain said he was \" too tired \" to attend , and even refused Schayes ' plea to at least show up and shoot a few foul shots with the team . In Game 4 , Boston won 114 \u2013 108 . Prior to Game 5 , Chamberlain was nowhere to be found , skipping practice and being non-accessible . Outwardly , Schayes defended his star center as \" excused from practice \" , but his teammates knew the truth and were much less forgiving . In Game 5 itself , Chamberlain was superb , scoring 46 points and grabbing 34 rebounds , but the Celtics won the game 120 \u2013 112 and the series . Cherry is highly critical of Chamberlain : while conceding he was the only Sixers player who performed in the series , he pointed out his unprofessional , egotistical behavior as being a bad example for his teammates . Prior to the 1966 \u2013 67 NBA season , the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a familiar face , the crafty but firm Alex Hannum . In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting , Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season , several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light . Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions , players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight . Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum \" never backed down \" and \" showed who was the boss \" . By doing this , he won Chamberlain 's respect . When emotions cooled off , Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title ; but to pull this off , he \u2013 like his teammates \u2013 had to \" act like a man \" both on and off the court . Concerning basketball , he persuaded him to change his style of play . Loaded with several other players who could score , such as future Hall-of-Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham , Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense . As a result , Chamberlain was less dominant , taking only 14 % of the team 's shots ( in his 50.4 ppg season , it was 35.3 % ) , but extremely efficient : he averaged a career-low 24.1 points , but he led the league in rebounds ( 24.2 ) , ended third in assists ( 7.8 ) , had a record breaking .683 field goal accuracy , and played strong defense . For these feats , Chamberlain earned his third MVP award . The Sixers charged their way to a then-record 68 \u2013 13 season , including a record 46 \u2013 4 start . In addition , the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates , lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the \" ultimate power forward \" , calling Hal Greer a deadly jumpshooter , and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer . Off the court , the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill , knowing he earned 10 times more than all the others . Greer , who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude , spoke positively of the new Chamberlain : \" You knew in a minute the Big Fella [ Chamberlain ] was ready to go ... and everybody would follow . \" In the 1967 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers yet again battled the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals , and again held home court advantage . In Game 1 , the Sixers beat Boston 127 \u2013 112 , powered by Hal Greer 's 39 points and Chamberlain 's unofficial quadruple double , with 24 points , 32 rebounds , 13 assists and ( unofficially counted ) 12 blocks . In Game 2 , the Sixers won 107 \u2013 102 in overtime , and player-coach Russell grudgingly praised Chamberlain for intimidating the Celtics into taking low percentage shots from further outside . In Game 3 , Chamberlain grabbed 41 rebounds and helped the Sixers win 115 \u2013 104 . The Celtics prevented a sweep by winning Game 4 with a 121 \u2013 117 victory , but in Game 5 , the Sixers simply overpowered the Celtics 140 \u2013 116 , which effectively ended Boston 's historic run of eight consecutive NBA titles . The Sixers ' center scored 29 points , 36 rebounds and 13 assists and was highly praised by Celtics Russell and K.C. Jones . In the 1967 NBA Finals , the Sixers were pitted against Chamberlain 's old team , the San Francisco Warriors of his one-time backup Nate Thurmond and star forward Rick Barry . The Sixers won the first two games , with Chamberlain and Greer taking credit for respectively defensive dominance and clutch shooting , but San Francisco won two of the next three games , so Philadelphia was up 3 \u2013 2 prior to Game 6 . In Game 6 , the Warriors were trailing 123 \u2013 122 with 15 seconds left . For the last play , Thurmond and Barry were assigned to do a pick and roll against Chamberlain and whoever would guard Barry . However , the Sixers foiled it : when Barry ran past Thurmond 's pick and drove to the basket , he was picked up by Chet Walker , making it impossible to shoot ; Thurmond was covered by Chamberlain , which made it impossible to pass . Barry botched his shot attempt , and the Sixers won the championship . Chamberlain said : \" It is wonderful to be a part of the greatest team in basketball ... being a champion is like having a big round glow inside of you . \" He contributed with 17.7 ppg and 28.7 rpg against fellow future Hall-of-Fame pivot Nate Thurmond , never failing to snare at least 23 rebounds in the six games . Chamberlain himself described the team as the best in NBA history . In 2002 , writer Wayne Lynch wrote a book about this remarkable Sixers season , Season of the 76ers , centering on Chamberlain . In the 1967 \u2013 68 NBA season , matters began to turn sour between Chamberlain and the Sixers ' sole surviving owner , Irv Kosloff . This conflict had been going along for a while : in 1965 , Chamberlain asserted that he and the late Richman had worked out a deal which would give the center 25 % of the franchise once he ended his career . Although there is no written proof for or against , ex-Sixers coach Dolph Schayes and Sixers lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was right ; in any case , Kosloff declined the request , leaving Chamberlain livid and willing to jump to the rival ABA once his contract ended in 1967 . Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce , and later signed a one-year , $ 250,000 contract . On the hardwood , Chamberlain continued his focus on team play and registered 24.3 points and 23.8 rebounds a game for the season . The 76ers had the best record in the league for the third straight season . Chamberlain made history by becoming the only center in NBA history to finish the season as the leader in assists , his 702 beating runner-up , Hall-of-Fame point guard Lenny Wilkens ' total by 23 . Chamberlain likened his assist title to legendary home run hitter \" Babe Ruth leading the league in sacrifice bunts \" , and he dispelled the myth that he could not and would not pass the ball . For these feats , Chamberlain won his fourth and last MVP title . Another landmark was his 25,000th point , making him the first ever player to score these many points : he gave the ball to his team physician Dr. Stan Lorber . Winning 62 games , the Sixers easily took the first playoff berth of the 1968 NBA Playoffs . In the 1968 Eastern Division Semifinals , they were pitted against the Knicks . In a physically tough matchup , the Sixers lost sixth man Billy Cunningham with a broken hand , and Chamberlain , Greer and Jackson were struggling with inflamed feet , bad knees , and pulled hamstrings respectively . Going ahead 3 \u2013 2 , the Sixers defeated the Knicks 115 \u2013 97 in Game 6 after Chamberlain scored 25 points and 27 rebounds : he had a successful series in which he led both teams in points ( 153 ) , rebounds ( 145 ) and assists ( 38 ) . In the 1968 Eastern Division Finals , the Sixers yet again met the Boston Celtics , again with home court advantage , and this time as reigning champions . Despite the Sixers ' injury woes , coach Hannum was confident to \" take the Celtics in less than seven games \" : he pointed out the age of the Celtics , who were built around Bill Russell and guard Sam Jones , both 34 . But then , national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4 , 1968 . With eight of the ten starting players on the Sixers and Celtics being African-American , both teams were in deep shock , and there were calls to cancel the series . In a game called \" unreal \" and \" devoid of emotion \" , the Sixers lost 127 \u2013 118 on April 5 . After attending Dr. King 's funeral , Chamberlain called out to the angry rioters who were setting fires all over the country , stating Dr. King would not have approved . In Game 2 , Philadelphia evened the series with a 115 \u2013 106 victory , and won Games 3 and 4 , with Chamberlain suspiciously often played by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry , causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down . Prior to Game 5 , the Celtics seemed dead : no NBA team had overcome a 3 \u2013 1 series deficit before . However , the Celtics rallied back , winning Games 5 and 6 122 \u2013 104 and 114 \u2013 106 respectively , powered by a spirited John Havlicek and helped by the Sixers ' terrible shooting . What followed was the first of three consecutive controversial and painful Game 7s in which Chamberlain played . In that Game 7 , the Sixers could not get their act together : 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100 \u2013 96 defeat , making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading three games to one . Although Cherry points out that the Sixers shot badly ( Hal Greer , Wali Jones , Chet Walker , Luke Jackson and Matt Guokas hit a combined 25 of 74 shots ) and Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4-of-9 , the center himself scored only 14 points . In the second half of Game 7 , Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field . Cherry observes a strange pattern in that game : in a typical Sixers game , Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post , but only 23 times in Game 7 , and only seven times in the third and only twice in the fourth quarter . Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches , a point which the coach conceded himself , but Cherry points out that Chamberlain , who always thought of himself as the best player of all time , should have been outspoken enough to demand the ball himself . The loss meant that Chamberlain was now 1 \u2013 6 in playoff series against the Celtics . After that season , coach Alex Hannum wanted to be closer to his family on the West Coast ; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association . Chamberlain then asked for a trade , and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff , Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers . The motivation for this move remains in dispute . According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby , a journalist close to the Lakers , Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal , but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay , who was the Sixers general manager then , Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left , and forced the trade himself . Cherry finally adds several personal reasons : the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia , sought the presence of fellow celebrities ( which were plenty in L.A. ) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women , which was possible for a black man in L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then . = = = Los Angeles Lakers ( 1968 \u2013 1973 ) = = = On July 9 , 1968 , Chamberlain was the centerpiece of a major trade between the 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers , who sent center Darrall Imhoff , forward Jerry Chambers and guard Archie Clark to Philadelphia , making it the first time a reigning NBA Most Valuable Player was traded the next season . Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract , paying him $ 250,000 after taxes ( about $ 1.7 million in real value ) ; in comparison , previous Lakers top earner Jerry West was paid $ 100,000 before taxes ( about $ 680,000 in real value ) . Chamberlain joined a squad which featured Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor and Hall-of-Fame guard Jerry West , along with backup center Mel Counts , forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins and talented 5 ' 11 \" guard Johnny Egan . The lack of a second guard next to West ( and thus , the lack of speed and quickness ) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff ; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich , who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft , he said : \" Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [ lack of ] size ... but if I don 't play him , we look like a bunch of trucks . \" In addition , Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower , which made him difficult to fit in . While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West , he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor ; regarding Baylor , he later explained : \" We were good friends , but ... [ in ] black culture ... you never let the other guy one-up you . \" The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff : pejoratively calling the new recruit \" The Load \" , he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical , never respected him , too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics . In return , the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as \" the dumbest and worst coach ever \" . Laker Keith Erickson observed that \" Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry ... and that is not a good way to get on Wilt 's side ... that relationship was doomed from the start . \" Chamberlain experienced a problematic and often frustrating season . Van Breda Kolff benched him several times , which never happened in his career before ; in mid-season , the perennial scoring champion had two games in which he scored only six and then only two points . Playing through his problems , Chamberlain averaged 20.5 points and 21.1 rebounds a game that season . However , Jack Kent Cooke was pleased , because since acquiring Chamberlain , ticket sales went up by 11 % . In the 1969 NBA Playoffs , the Lakers dispatched Chamberlain 's old club , the San Francisco Warriors 4 \u2013 2 after losing the first two games , and then defeated the Atlanta Hawks and met Chamberlain 's familiar rivals , Bill Russell 's Boston Celtics . Going into the series as 3-to-1 favorites , the Lakers won the first two games , but dropped the next two . Chamberlain was criticized as a non-factor in the series , getting neutralized by Bill Russell with little effort . But in Game 5 , the Lakers center scored 13 points and grabbed 31 rebounds , leading Los Angeles to a 117 \u2013 104 win . In Game 6 , the Celtics won 99 \u2013 90 , and Chamberlain only scored eight points ; Cherry accuses him of choking , because if \" Chamberlain had come up big and put up a normal 30 point scoring night \" , L.A. would have probably won its first championship . Game 7 featured a surreal scene : in anticipation of a Lakers win , Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles . This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics . In Game 7 , the Lakers trailed 91 \u2013 76 after three quarters . The Lakers mounted a comeback ; then Chamberlain twisted his knee after a rebound and had to be replaced by Mel Counts . With three minutes to go the Lakers trailed 103 \u2013 102 . The Lakers committed costly turnovers and lost the game 108 \u2013 106 , despite a triple-double from West , who had 42 points , 13 rebounds and 12 assists . West became the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team . After the game , many wondered why Chamberlain sat out the final six minutes . At the time of his final substitution , he had scored 18 points ( hitting seven of his eight shots ) and grabbed 27 rebounds , significantly better than the 10 points of Mel Counts on 4-of-13 shooting . Among others , Bill Russell didn 't believe Chamberlain 's injury was grave , and openly accused him of being a malingerer : \" Any injury short of a broken leg or a broken back is not enough . \" Ironically , Van Breda Kolff came to Chamberlain 's defense , insisting the often-maligned Lakers center hardly was able to move in the end . He himself was perceived as \" pig-headed \" for benching Chamberlain , and soon resigned as Lakers coach . Cherry comments that according to some journalists , that Game 7 \" destroyed two careers : Wilt 's because he wouldn 't take over and Van Breda Kolff because he wouldn 't give in \" . In his second year with the Lakers under new coach Joe Mullaney , Chamberlain seriously injured his knee . He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule , suffering a total rupture of the patellar tendon at the base of his right kneecap , and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season . Owing to a great start , he managed to average 27.3 points , 18.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game . Again , the Lakers charged through the playoffs , and in the 1970 NBA Finals , the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks , loaded with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed , Dave DeBusschere , Bill Bradley , and Walt Frazier . Cherry observed that Reed , a prolific midrange shooter , was a bad matchup for Chamberlain : having lost lateral quickness due to his injury , the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed 's preferred high post jump shots . In Game 1 , New York masterminded a 124 \u2013 112 win in which Reed scored 37 points . In Game 2 , Chamberlain scored 19 points , grabbed 24 rebounds , and blocked Reed 's shot in the final seconds , leading the Lakers to a 105 \u2013 103 win . Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60-foot shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102 ; however , the Knicks took the game 111 \u2013 108 . In Game 4 , Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2 . In Game 5 , with the Knicks trailing by double digits , Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series . By conventional wisdom , Chamberlain now should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere , who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center . Instead , the Lakers gave away their 13-point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense : L.A. committed 19 second half turnovers , and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times , respectively , in the entire second half . The Lakers lost 107 \u2013 100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history . In Game 6 , Chamberlain scored 45 points and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135 \u2013 113 Lakers win , and with Reed out , the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York . However , the hero of that Game 7 was Willis Reed . He famously hobbled up court , scored the first four points , and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time . The Knicks led by 27 at halftime , and despite scoring 21 points , Chamberlain couldn 't prevent a third consecutive loss in a Game 7 . The Lakers center himself was criticized for his inability to dominate his injured counterpart , but Cherry pointed out that Chamberlain 's feat \u2013 coming back from a career-threatening injury himself \u2013 was too quickly forgotten . In the 1970 \u2013 71 NBA season , the Lakers made a notable move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich , who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968 . Chamberlain averaged 20.7 points , 18.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists , once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title . After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career , and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury , the handicapped Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor , and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals . Winning the regular season with 66 wins , the Bucks were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers ; still , many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor . In Game 1 , Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32 \u2013 22 , and the Bucks won 106 \u2013 85 . In Game 2 , the Bucks won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points , four more than his Milwaukee counterpart . Prior to Game 3 , things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson , West 's stand-in , had an appendectomy and was out for the season ; with rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure , Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118 \u2013 107 victory , but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117 \u2013 94 in Game 4 to take a 3 \u2013 1 series lead . Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116 \u2013 98 victory in Game 5 . Although Chamberlain lost , he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor , who was not only 10 years younger , but healthy . After the 1971 playoffs , Chamberlain had yet another offer to fight heavyweight boxing legend Muhammad Ali . The 15-round fight would have taken place on July 26 , 1971 in the Houston Astrodome but Chamberlain refused . The potential Chamberlain-Ali match was predicated on Ali beating Joe Frazier in a fight scheduled for early 1971 . However , Frazier defeated Ali to hand Ali his first professional loss . As a result , Chamberlain declined the fight through a contractual escape clause . In a 1999 interview , Chamberlain stated that boxing trainer Cus D 'Amato wanted to train him for the fight , and they offered Ali and him $ 5 million each to battle each other . Chamberlain checked back with his father and finally said no . Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had also offered Chamberlain a record-setting contract on the condition that Chamberlain agree to give up what Cooke termed \" this boxing foolishness . \" This was not the first time a Chamberlain-Ali fight had been explored , as offers had also been made in both 1965 and 1967 . In 1967 , recently retired NFL star Jim Brown acted as Chamberlain 's manager , but Ali 's manager Jabir Herbert Muhammad backed out of the Chamberlain-Ali match which was slated to take place at Madison Square Garden . In the 1971 \u2013 72 NBA season , the Lakers hired former Celtics star guard Bill Sharman as head coach . Sharman introduced morning shoot-arounds , in which the perennial latecomer Chamberlain regularly participated ( in contrast to earlier years with Dolph Schayes ) and transformed him into a defensive-minded , low-scoring post defender in the mold of his old rival Bill Russell . Furthermore , he told Chamberlain to use his rebounding and passing skills to quickly initiate fastbreaks to his teammates . While no longer being the main scorer , Chamberlain was named the new captain of the Lakers : after rupturing his Achilles tendon , perennial captain Elgin Baylor retired , leaving a void the center now filled . Initially , Sharman wanted Chamberlain and West to share this duty , but West declined , stating he was injury-prone and wanted to solely concentrate on the game . Chamberlain accepted his new roles and posted an all-time low 14.8 points , but also won the rebound crown with 19.2 rpg and led the league with a .649 field goal percentage . Powered by his defensive presence , the Lakers embarked on an unprecedented 33-game win streak en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season . Yet the streak led to one strangely dissonant event . According to Flynn Robinson , after the record-setting streak , Lakers owner Cooke sought to reward each of his players \u2014 who were expecting perhaps a \" trip to Hawaii \" \u2014 with a $ 5 pen set . In response , Chamberlain \" had everybody put all the pens in the middle of the floor and stepped on them . \" In the post-season , the Lakers swept the Chicago Bulls , then went on to face the Milwaukee Bucks of young superstar center and regular-season MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ( formerly Lew Alcindor ) . The matchup between Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar was hailed by LIFE magazine as the greatest matchup in all of sports . Chamberlain would help lead the Lakers past Abdul-Jabbar and the Bucks in six games . Particularly , Chamberlain was lauded for his performance in Game 6 , which the Lakers won 104 \u2013 100 after trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter : he scored 24 points and 22 rebounds , played all 48 minutes and outsprinted the younger Bucks center on several late Lakers fast breaks . Jerry West called it \" the greatest ball-busting performance I have ever seen . \" Chamberlain performed so well in the series that TIME magazine stated , \" In the N.B.A. ' s western division title series with Milwaukee , he ( Chamberlain ) decisively outplayed basketball 's newest giant superstar , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , eleven years his junior . \" In the 1972 NBA Finals , the Lakers again met the New York Knicks ; the Knicks were shorthanded after losing 6 ' 9 \" Willis Reed to injury , and so , undersized 6 ' 8 \" Jerry Lucas had the task to defend against the 7 ' 1 \" Chamberlain . However , prolific outside shooter Lucas helped New York to win Game 1 , hitting nine of his 11 shots in the first half alone ; in Game 2 , which the Lakers won 106 \u2013 92 , Chamberlain put Lucas into foul trouble , and the Knicks lost defensive power forward Dave DeBusschere to injury . In Game 3 , Chamberlain scored 26 points and grabbed 20 rebounds for another Lakers win , and in a fiercely battled Game 4 , the Lakers center was playing with five fouls late in the game . Having never fouled out in his career \u2013 a feat that he was very proud of \u2013 he played aggressive defense despite the risk of fouling out , and blocked two of Lucas ' shots in overtime , proving those wrong who said he only played for his own stats ; he ended scoring a game-high 27 points . But in that game , he fell on his right hand , and was said to have \" sprained \" it ; it was actually broken . For Game 5 , Chamberlain 's hands were packed into thick pads normally destined for defensive linesmen in American Football ; he was offered a painkilling shot , but refused because he feared he would lose his shooting touch if his hands became numb . In Game 5 , Chamberlain recorded 24 points , 29 rebounds , eight assists and eight blocked shots . ( While blocked shots were not an official NBA stat at that time , announcer Keith Jackson counted the blocks during the broadcast . ) Chamberlain 's outstanding all-around performance helped the Lakers win their first championship in Los Angeles with a decisive 114 \u2013 100 win . Chamberlain was named Finals MVP , and was admired for dominating the Knicks in Game 5 while playing injured . The 1972 \u2013 73 NBA season was to be Chamberlain 's last , although he didn 't know this at the time . In his last season , the Lakers lost substance : Happy Hairston was injured , Flynn Robinson and LeRoy Ellis had left , and veteran Jerry West struggled with injury . Chamberlain averaged 13.2 points and 18.6 rebounds , still enough to win the rebounding crown for the 11th time in his career . In addition , he shot an NBA record .727 % for the season , bettering his own mark of .683 from the 1966 \u2013 67 season . It was the ninth time Chamberlain would lead the league in field goal percentage . The Lakers won 60 games in the regular season and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks . This time , the tables were turned : the Knicks now featured a healthy team with a rejuvenated Willis Reed , and the Lakers were now handicapped by several injuries . In that series , the Lakers won Game 1 115 \u2013 112 , but the Knicks won Games 2 and 3 ; things worsened when Jerry West injured his hamstring yet again . In Game 4 , the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York , and in Game 5 , the valiant , but injured West and Hairston had miserable games , and despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds , the Lakers lost 102 \u2013 93 and the series . After the Knicks finished off the close fifth game with a late flourish led by Earl Monroe and Phil Jackson , Chamberlain made a dunk with one second left , which turned out to be the last play of his NBA career . = = = San Diego Conquistadors ( 1973 ) = = = In 1973 , the San Diego Conquistadors of the NBA rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $ 600,000 salary . However , the Lakers sued their former star and successfully prevented him from actually playing , because he still owed them the option year of his contract . Barred from playing , Chamberlain mostly left the coaching duties to his assistant Stan Albeck , who recalled : \" Chamberlain ... has a great feel for pro basketball ... [ but ] the day-to-day things that are an important part of basketball ... just bored him . He did not have the patience . \" The players were split on Chamberlain , who was seen as competent , but often indifferent and more occupied with promotion of his autobiography Wilt : Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door than with coaching . He once skipped a game to sign autographs for the book . In his single season as a coach , the Conquistadors went a mediocre 37 \u2013 47 in the regular season and lost against the Utah Stars in the Division Semifinals . However , Chamberlain was not pleased by the Qs ' meager attendance : crowds averaged 1,843 , just over half of the Qs ' small San Diego 3,200-seat sports arena . After the season , Chamberlain retired from professional basketball . = = NBA career statistics = = = = = Regular season = = = = = = Playoffs = = = = = Post-NBA career = = After his stint with the Conquistadors , Chamberlain successfully went into business and entertainment , made money in stocks and real estate , bought a popular Harlem nightclub , which he renamed Big Wilt 's Smalls Paradise , and invested in broodmares . Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and track and field teams , and also provided high-level teams for girls and women in basketball , track , volleyball and softball , and made money by appearing in ads for TWA , American Express , Volkswagen , Drexel Burnham , Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker . After his basketball career , volleyball became Chamberlain 's new passion : being a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days , he became board member of the newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later . As a testament to his importance , the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it : he rose to the challenge and was named the game 's MVP . He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979 . Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame : he became one of the few athletes who were enshrined in different sports . In 1976 Wilt turned to his interest in movies , forming a film production and distribution company to make his first film , entitled \" Go For It \" . Starting in the 1970s , he formed Wilt 's Athletic Club , a track and field club in southern California , coached by then UCLA assistant coach Bob Kersee in the early days of his career . Among the members of the team were : Florence Griffith before she set the current world records in the 100 meters and 200 meters ; Three time world champion Greg Foster ; future Olympic Gold medalists Andre Phillips ; Alice Brown ; Jeanette Bolden . In all , he claimed 60 athletes with aspirations of expanding to 100 . While actively promoting the sport in 1982 , Chamberlain claimed he was considering a return to athletic competition , but not in basketball , in Masters athletics . At the time he claimed he had only been beaten in the high jump once , by Olympic champion Charles Dumas , and that he had never been beaten in the shot put , including beating Olympic legend Al Oerter . Chamberlain played a villainous warrior and counterpart of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film Conan the Destroyer ( 1984 ) . In November 1998 , Wilt signed with Ian Ng Cheng Hin , CEO of Northern Cinema House Entertainment ( NCH Entertainment ) , to do his own bio-pic , wanting to tell his life story his way . He had been working on the screenplay notes for over a year at the time of his death . \" He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew . He was writing a screenplay about his life . He was interested in world affairs , sometimes he 'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy . I think he 'll be remembered as a great man . He happened to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that . He could talk on any subject . He was a Goliath , \" said Sy Goldberg , Chamberlain 's longtime attorney . When million-dollar contracts became common in the NBA , Chamberlain increasingly felt he had been underpaid during his career . A result of this resentment was the 1997 book Who 's Running the Asylum ? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today ( 1997 ) , in which he harshly criticized the NBA of the 1990s for being too disrespectful of players of the past . Even far beyond his playing days , Chamberlain was a very fit person . In his mid-forties , he was able to humble rookie Magic Johnson in practice , and even in the 1980s , he flirted with making a comeback in the NBA . In the 1980 \u2013 81 NBA season , coach Larry Brown recalled that the 45-year-old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers . When Chamberlain was 50 , the New Jersey Nets had the same idea , and Chamberlain declined again . However , he would continue to epitomize physical fitness for years to come , including participating in several marathons . = = Legacy = = = = = Individual achievements and recognition = = = Chamberlain is regarded as one of the most extraordinary and dominant basketball players in the history of the NBA . The 1972 NBA Finals MVP is holder of numerous official NBA all-time records , establishing himself as a scoring champion , all-time top rebounder and accurate field goal shooter . He led the NBA in scoring seven times , field goal percentage nine times , minutes played eight times , rebounding eleven times , and assists once . He was also responsible for several rule changes , including widening the lane from 12 to 16 feet , as well as changes to rules regarding inbounding the ball and shooting free throws . Chamberlain is most remembered for his 100-point game , which is widely considered one of basketball 's greatest records . Decades after his record , many NBA teams did not even average 100 points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted . The closest any player has gotten to 100 points was the Los Angeles Lakers ' Kobe Bryant , who scored 81 in 2006 . Bryant afterwards said Chamberlain 's record was \" unthinkable ... It 's pretty exhausting to think about it . \" Chamberlain 's main weakness was his notoriously poor free throw shooting , where he has the third lowest career free throw percentage in NBA history with 51.1 % ( based on a minimum of 1,200 attempts ) . Chamberlain claimed that he intentionally missed free throws so a teammate could get the rebound and score two points instead of one , but later acknowledged that he was a \" psycho case \" in this matter . On the other hand , he committed surprisingly few fouls during his NBA career , despite the rugged play in the post . Chamberlain never fouled out of a regular season or playoff game in his 14-year NBA career . His career average was only two fouls per game , despite having averaged 45.8 minutes per game over his career . He had five seasons where he committed less than two fouls per game , with a career low of 1.5 fouls during the 1962 season , in which he also averaged 50.4 points per game . His fouls per 36 minutes ( a stat used to compare players that average vastly different minutes ) was a remarkable 1.6 per game . \" First he was a scorer . Then he was a rebounder and assist man . Then with our great Laker team in 1972 , he concentrated on the defensive end , \" said Sharman . In his two championship seasons , Chamberlain led the league in rebounding , while his scoring decreased to 24 and 15 points per game . By 1971 \u2013 72 at age 35 and running less , his game had transformed to averaging only nine shots per game , compared to the 40 in his record-setting 1961 \u2013 62 season . He also has a signature ' Dipper ' move , whereby he would fake a hook shot , and extends his arm to a short-range finger roll to shoot under a block attempt . For his feats , Chamberlain was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978 , named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History , ranked # 2 in SLAM Magazine 's Top 50 NBA Players of All-Time and # 13 in the ESPN list \" Top North American athletes of the century \" and voted the second best center of All-Time by ESPN behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on March 6 , 2007 . During his career , Chamberlain competed against future Hall of Famers including Russell , Thurmond , Lucas , and Walt Bellamy . He later faced Unseld , Abdul-Jabbar , Dave Cowens , and Elvin Hayes . = = = Chamberlain \u2013 Russell rivalry = = = From a historical NBA perspective , the rivalry between Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis Bill Russell is cited as the greatest on-court rivalry of all time . There were three NBA Finals matchups in the rivalry between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson , but they played different positions and did not guard each other . Russell 's Celtics won seven of eight playoff series against Chamberlain 's Warriors , 76ers , and Lakers teams , and went 57 \u2013 37 against them in the regular season and 29 \u2013 20 in the playoffs . Russell 's teams won all four seventh games against Chamberlain 's \u2014 the combined margin was nine points . Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 14.2 per game and outrebounded him 28.2 to 22.9 in the regular season , and also in the playoffs , he outscored him 25.7 to 14.9 and outrebounded him 28 to 24.7 . The comparison between the two is often simplified to a great player ( Chamberlain ) versus a player who makes his team great ( Russell ) , an individualist against a team player . In 1961 \u2013 62 when Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points per game , he noted that Boston did not rely on Russell 's scoring , and he could concentrate on defense and rebounding . He wished people would understand that their roles were different . Chamberlain said , \" I 've got to hit forty points or so , or this team is in trouble . I must score \u2014 understand ? After that I play defense and get the ball off the boards . I try to do them all , best I can , but scoring comes first . \" Russell won 11 NBA titles in his career while Chamberlain won two . Chamberlain was named All-NBA first team seven times to Russell 's three , but Russell was named league MVP \u2014 then selected by players and not the press \u2014 five times against Chamberlain 's four . Russell and Chamberlain were friends in private life . Russell never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term , instead pointing out that they rarely talked about basketball when they were alone . When Chamberlain died in 1999 , Chamberlain 's nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to . The two did not speak for two decades after Russell criticized Chamberlain after Game 7 of the 1969 Finals . Russell apologized privately to Chamberlain and later publicly . = = = Rule changes = = = Chamberlain 's impact on the game is also reflected in the fact that he was directly responsible for several rule changes in the NBA , including widening the lane to try to keep him farther away from the hoop , instituting offensive goaltending and revising rules governing inbounding the ball and shooting free throws ( such as making it against the rules to inbound the ball over the backboard ) . Chamberlain , who reportedly had a 50-inch vertical leap , was physically capable of converting foul shots via a slam dunk without a running start ( beginning his movement at the top of the key ) . When his dunks practically undermined the difficulty of a foul shot , both the NCAA and the NBA banned his modus operandi . In basketball history , pundits have stated that the only other player who forced such a massive change of rules is 6 ' 10 \" Minneapolis Lakers center George Mikan , who played a decade before Chamberlain and also caused many rule changes designed to thwart so-called \" big men \" . = = = Reputation = = = Although Chamberlain racked up some of the most impressive statistics in the history of Northern American professional sports , because he won \" just \" two NBA championships and lost seven out of eight playoff series against the Celtics teams of his on-court nemesis Bill Russell , Chamberlain was often called \" selfish \" and a \" loser \" . Frank Deford of ESPN said that Chamberlain was caught in a no-win situation : \" If you win , everybody says , ' Well , look at him , he 's that big . ' If you lose , everybody says , ' How could he lose , a guy that size ? ' \" Chamberlain himself often said : \" Nobody roots for Goliath . \" Like later superstar Shaquille O 'Neal , Chamberlain was a target of criticism because of his poor free throw shooting , an abysmal .511 career average , with a low of .380 over the 1967 \u2013 68 season . Countless suggestions were offered ; he shot them underhanded , one-handed , two-handed , from the side of the circle , from well behind the line , and even banked in . Sixers coach Alex Hannum once suggested he shoot his famous fadeaway jumper as a free throw , but Chamberlain feared drawing more attention to his one great failing . Despite his foul line woes , Chamberlain set the NBA record ( 28 ) for free throws made in a regular season game in his 1962 100-point game . Furthermore , Chamberlain damaged his reputation in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated . In an interview entitled \" My Life in a Bush League \" , he criticized his fellow players , coaches , and NBA administrators . Chamberlain later commented that he could see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image . However , contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain . Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain , Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court \" comical \" , and when 6 ft 11 in 250-pound ( in his early years ) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career , Lanier answered : \" When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position . \" = = Personal life = = = = = Star status = = = Wilt Chamberlain was the first big earner of basketball : immediately becoming the highest paid player upon entering the NBA , Chamberlain was basketball 's first player to earn at least $ 100,000 a year , and earned an unprecedented $ 1.5 million during his Lakers years . As a Philadelphia 76er , he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia . In addition , he would often stay out late into the night and wake up at noon , a point that became notorious in the 1965 \u2013 66 NBA season . When he became a Laker , Chamberlain built a million-dollar mansion he called the \" Ursa Major \" in Bel-Air , as a play on his nickname \" The Big Dipper \" . It had a 2,200-pound pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury . Robert Allen Cherry , journalist and author of the biography Wilt : Larger than Life , describes his house as a miniature Playboy Mansion , where he regularly held parties and lived out his later-notorious sex life . This was also helped by the fact that Chamberlain was a near-insomniac who often simply skipped sleeping . Designed according to his preferences , the house was constructed with no right angles , and had an \" X-rated \" room with mirrored walls and a fur-covered waterbed . Chamberlain lived alone , relying on a great deal of automated gadgets , with two cats named Zip and Zap and several Great Dane dogs as company . In addition , Chamberlain drove a Ferrari , a Bentley , and had a Le Mans-style car called Searcher One designed and built at a cost of $ 750,000 in 1996 . Following his death , in 2000 Chamberlain 's estate was valued at $ 25 million . = = = Love life = = = Although shy and insecure as a teenager , adult Chamberlain became well known for his womanizing . As his lawyer Seymour \" Sy \" Goldberg put it : \" Some people collect stamps , Wilt collected women . \" Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette T\u00e5nnander , who met him when he was 40 and she 19 , remembers him as a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful : \" I think Wilt hit on everything that moved ... [ but ] he never was bad or rude . \" Many of Chamberlain 's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days , had no problems organizing a threesome ( or more ) , and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the television show In Living Color in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall-like list of women who slept with him , both of them pointing out that their names are on it , as well as a 1991 Saturday Night Live sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in \" Remembrances of Love \" , where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes . However , Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife , Chamberlain was \" rude and sexist toward his own date , as he usually was \" , adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of an attractive woman at a nearby table . According to Rod Roddewig , a contemporary of Wilt 's , Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer . Every time Chamberlain went to bed with a different woman , he put a check in his Day-Timer . Over a 10 day period , there were 23 checks in the book , which would be a rate of 2.3 women per day . Chamberlain divided that number in half , to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation . He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years . That was how the 20,000 number came into existence . In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity , Chamberlain later emphasized that \" the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life . That 's the reason why I was single . \" In a 1999 interview shortly before his death , Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate at the time of his escapades , and warned other men who admired him for it , closing with the words : \" With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool , I have learned in my life I 've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying . \" Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children . = = = Relationships = = = Although Cherry points out that Chamberlain was an egotist , he added that he had good relationships with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect . He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans , often providing tickets and signing autographs . Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention . Jerry West called him a \" complex ... very nice person \" , and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said : \" The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person ... he could have killed us all with his left hand . \" Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular , he would have been meaner and able to win more titles . During most of his NBA career , Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell . Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving , and at Russell 's place , conversation mostly concerned Russell 's electric trains . But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided , the relationship got strained , and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of \" copping out \" in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals . The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years , until Russell apologized privately , then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas : \" There was a thing almost 30 years ago ... I was wrong . \" Still , Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness , regretted that he should have been \" more physical \" with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for \" intellectualizing \" basketball in a negative way . More hostile was Chamberlain 's relationship with fellow center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , ten years his junior . Although Abdul-Jabbar idolized him as a teenager and was once part of his inner circle , the student / mentor bond deteriorated into intense mutual loathing , especially after Chamberlain retired . Chamberlain often criticized Abdul-Jabbar for a perceived lack of scoring , rebounding , and defense . Abdul-Jabbar accused Chamberlain of being a traitor to the black race for his Republican political leanings , support of Richard Nixon , and relationships with white women . When Abdul-Jabbar broke Chamberlain 's all-time scoring record in 1984 , Chamberlain repeatedly called on Kareem to retire . When Abdul-Jabbar published his autobiography in 1990 , he retaliated by writing a paper titled \" To Wilt Chumperlane [ sic ] \" in which he stated \" Now that I am done playing , history will remember me as someone who helped teammates to win , while you will be remembered as a crybaby , a loser , and a quitter . \" Their relationship remained mostly strained until the end . = = = Politics = = = Chamberlain denounced the Black Panthers and other black nationalist movements in the late 1960s , and supported Republican Richard Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections . Chamberlain accompanied Nixon to the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . He considered himself a Republican . = = Death = = Chamberlain had a history of heart trouble . In 1992 , Chamberlain was briefly hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat . According to those close to him , he eventually began taking medication for his heart troubles . In 1999 , his condition deteriorated rapidly . During this time , he lost 50 pounds . After undergoing dental surgery in the week before his death , he was in great pain and seemed unable to recover from the stress . On October 12 , 1999 , Chamberlain died in Bel-Air , California , at the age of 63 . He was cremated . His agent Sy Goldberg stated Chamberlain died of congestive heart failure . He was survived by his sisters Barbara Lewis , Margaret Lane , Selina Gross and Yvonne Chamberlain , and brothers Wilbert and Oliver Chamberlain . NBA players and officials were saddened at the loss of a player they universally remembered as a symbol of the sport . His lifelong on-court rival and personal friend Bill Russell stated \" the fierceness of our competition bonded us together for eternity \" , and Celtics coach Red Auerbach praised Chamberlain as vital for the success of the entire NBA . Ex-Lakers teammate Jerry West remembered him as an utterly dominant , yet friendly and humorous player , and fellow Hall-of-Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Johnny Kerr , Phil Jackson and Wes Unseld called Chamberlain one of the greatest players in the history of the sport .",

                    "text": "Big Four ( tennis ) = In tennis , the term Big Four refers to the quartet of men 's singles players Roger Federer , Rafael Nadal , Novak Djokovic , and Andy Murray . They reigned as the four best players in the world every season from 2008 \u2013 2016 . These players were considered dominant in terms of ranking and tournament victories , including Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters 1000 events , as well as the ATP World Tour Finals and Olympic Games . Federer was the first to come to prominence after winning Wimbledon in 2003 and established himself as the world No. 1 by the beginning of 2004 . Nadal followed in 2005 after a French Open triumph including a win over Federer , and they occupied the top two places in the ATP rankings for 211 consecutive weeks from July 2005 to August 2009 . Djokovic , from 2007 , and later Murray , from 2009 , increasingly challenged Federer 's and Nadal 's dominance with seasonal consistency : Djokovic captured three of the four major tournaments in 2011 , and in 2012 the quartet won one Major tournament apiece . In 2011 , Nadal declared that his and Federer 's period of joint dominance had ended , owing to the ascent of other players , notably Djokovic and Murray . Since this time the term \" Big Four \" , while used previously , became popular with the media and in tennis literature . The Big Four were a critical part of what has , since 2010 , often been labelled a new \" Golden Era \" in tennis ; that term is also applied to the mid-1970s to 1980s , and the 1920s to the 1930s . Between them , they have won 42 of the last 46 men 's major singles titles , from the 2005 French Open through to the 2016 Wimbledon Championships ( the only times they haven 't won being at the 2009 US Open , the 2014 Australian Open , the 2014 US Open and the 2015 French Open ) ; they have also won 11 of the previous 13 World Tour Finals ( previously Tennis Masters Cup ) , with Federer winning six and Djokovic winning five , with a record 4 consecutive from 2012 to 2015 . They have regularly occupied the top four places in the year-end rankings between 2008 and 2013 , with Murray being the only member not to have been ranked world No. 1 , having reached a career high No. 2 on several occasions . Of the four , Federer leads with a record 17 Grand Slam tournament titles followed by Nadal ( 14 ) , Djokovic ( 12 ) and Murray ( 3 ) . Federer , Nadal , and Djokovic have completed a Career Grand Slam by winning each of the four Majors at least once , with Nadal also winning a gold medal at 2008 Summer Olympics for a Career Golden Slam . Murray has won neither the French Open nor the Australian Open , despite reaching the final five times in Melbourne and once in Paris , but won the gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Furthermore , at ATP Masters 1000 tournaments , they are all in historic top 10 list , Djokovic leads with a record 29 titles , Nadal ( 28 ) , Federer ( 24 ) , and Murray ( 12 ) . All four players have also played key roles in leading their countries to success in the Davis Cup , including in Djokovic 's and Federer 's case with Serbia ( 2010 ) and Switzerland ( 2014 ) winning the competition for the first time , while Nadal has racked up four Davis Cup titles , and in Murray 's case , ending a drought of 79 years for Great Britain in 2015 . = = History = = = = = Before 2008 = = = = = = = Big two : Federer and Nadal = = = = The early 2000s were seen as a time of transition in tennis , with older players retiring and a few players breaking through at the very top of the game . Roger Federer had first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998 , finishing his first full ATP season the following year before finishing 2002 ranked sixth in the world , his first year-end ranking in the top 8 . His breakthrough came in 2003 when he won his first Grand Slam tournament , and finished the year as world number 2 behind Andy Roddick . The following two years he had almost complete solo dominance , winning five of eight majors and losing just ten matches in 2004 and 2005 . Nadal had won his first ATP Tour match aged 15 years and 10 months in April 2002 , and he defeated Federer in their first meeting in 2004 at Miami . 2005 was Nadal 's breakthrough year , in which he won 24 consecutive matches on clay , including his first French Open beating Federer en route in the semifinals , and he finished as world number 2 while Federer remained number 1 for a second straight year . The period between 2005 and 2008 was subsequently dominated by the Federer \u2013 Nadal rivalry . They won 11 consecutive majors , meeting in every French Open and Wimbledon final from 2006 \u2013 2008 . The 2008 Wimbledon final , which Nadal won , has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts . From 2005 \u2013 2010 they ended every year as the world 's top two players . = = = = Djokovic and Murray = = = = Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were born a week apart , played each other as juniors and made their Grand Slam tournament debuts in 2005 . Djokovic made his ATP tour debut in 2004 , while Murray 's was in 2005 , a time when many bright youngsters joined the ATP tour . They both reached the world top 100 in 2005 , and the world top 20 in 2006 . Djokovic , however , began to excel ahead of Murray , reaching one major final and two semifinals in 2007 and began to challenge Federer and Nadal regularly . He also won two Masters tournament titles and 5 titles in total , finishing the year ranked number 3 in world . Murray , who was forced out of the French Open and Wimbledon by injury , ended 2007 ranked 11th , winning two ATP tournaments . = = = 2008 \u2013 2010 : Emergence of the Big Four = = = Between 2008 and 2010 , Novak Djokovic and later Andy Murray attempted to end the duopoly of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the summit of tennis . They did not break it but emerged ahead of the rest of the tour . At the 2008 Australian Open , Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the semifinals , reaching his first Australian Open final and ending Federer 's streak of ten consecutive Major finals , continuing his fine form at the end of the 2007 season which saw him reach his first major final . Djokovic went on to defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ( who had eliminated Nadal in the semifinal ) to win his first Major . Following his Australian Open win , Djokovic emerged as a clear world number three during the year , holding the ranking throughout 2008 . Meanwhile , Andy Murray continued to rise in the rankings , reaching his first Major quarterfinal at Wimbledon , losing to Nadal . He also won his first two Masters titles . Federer and Nadal remained the lead rivalry , and the pair met in the final of both the French Open and Wimbledon . Nadal won both , with the latter described as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time . In August 2008 , after winning the 2008 Summer Olympics gold medal , Nadal passed Federer to become world No. 1 , after Federer had been at the top for a record 237 consecutive weeks . The year 's final Major , the US Open , saw all four players reach the semifinals of the same Major for the first time . Federer defeated Djokovic in the semifinals , while Murray won through to his first Grand Slam tournament final after upsetting the top-ranked Nadal in four sets . Federer then defeated Murray in the final to win his fifth consecutive US Open title , and win his 13th Major title overall . Following the US Open , Murray entered the top four in the ATP rankings for the first time and all four players qualified for the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup , which Djokovic won . Despite having to withdraw from this event through injury , Nadal ended the year ranked world No. 1 , ahead of Federer and Djokovic with Murray respectively finishing fourth due to his run at the US Open . In 2009 , the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for a whole calendar year for the first time . This also prompted the first uses of the term ' Big Four ' to refer to the players , although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray who they themselves were still regarded ahead of the rest of the tour . At the Australian Open , Nadal won his first Australian Open title in another 5-set epic , obtaining a third consecutive Major final victory over Federer , while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier on . Nadal continued to dominate early in the season , but suffered from injury in June , allowing Federer to take the upper hand for the rest of the season . Federer subsequently passed the record for most Grand Slam tournament wins , taking his 14th Grand Slam title at the French Open , thus completing the Career Grand Slam after Nadal had prevented him from achieving this feat at the previous 4 French Open tournaments , and 15th title at Wimbledon respectively . Federer finished the season having reached all four Major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007 . Following Nadal 's injuries , Murray and Djokovic made up further grounds in the rankings , although neither of them were able to make a Major final in 2009 . In particular , their consistency at Masters level tournaments kept them in the top four of the rankings , with Murray reaching world No. 2 in August , and ending the 211-week reign of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the top two players of the world in the process . His reign as the world No. 2 would not last long , as he was upset in the fourth round of the US Open by Croat Marin \u010cili\u0107 . There , Djokovic reached his first Grand Slam tournament semifinal of 2009 , losing in straight sets to Federer while Nadal was defeated by eventual winner Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the semifinal . Between 2005 Australian Open and 2014 Australian Open , this was the only Grand Slam event not won by a member of the Big Four . ( Since then , Wawrinka won the 2014 Australian Open and 2015 French Open while \u010cili\u0107 won the 2014 US Open ) . At the end of 2009 Federer , Nadal , Djokovic and Murray finished as the ATP 's top four players for the second consecutive year with only Nadal and Federer changing positions from the 2008 final rankings list . During the 2010 season , the Big Four began to dominate the Tour as a group for the first time . The Big Four provided six of the eight Grand Slam tournament finalists , and won 14 tournaments combined in the season ( compared to 6 for the other four competitors at the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals ) . At the start of the year , Federer continued his dominance as world number one by winning the Australian Open , defeating Murray in the final however his run of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals came to end at the French Open that year losing to Robin S\u00f6derling in 4 sets , he also then lost to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych at Wimbledon ending his run of 7 consecutive Wimbledon finals . Nadal dominated the clay-court season again , winning all three clay-court Masters events and the French Open . Nadal also won at Wimbledon , although in both of these tournaments he only had to face one other member of the Big Four ( Murray in the Wimbledon semi-finals ) . At the US Open , Djokovic beat Federer to reach his third Major final , although Nadal won once again to complete his Career Grand Slam . In November , Robin S\u00f6derling ( who has reached the French Open final ) briefly passed Murray to reach fourth place in the ATP rankings , threatening to break the Big Four 's run of filling the end-of-year rankings . However , all of the Big Four reached the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals semifinals with Federer defeating Nadal in 3 sets in the final , leading to them achieving their third successive season in the top 4 positions . Again Djokovic and Murray were third and fourth respectively , both reaching one Grand Slam tournament final apiece . = = = 2011 to 2013 : Dominance = = = The 2011 season was dominated by Novak Djokovic . Djokovic won 10 titles in total , including three Grand Slam tournament titles ( only the fifth man in the open era to do so ) and five ATP Masters 1000 titles ( a record ) , enjoyed a 41 match winning streak ( ended by Federer in the semifinals of the 2011 French Open ) , amassed a record in prize money , and ascended to world No. 1 in the world for the first time in July . The season was described by many experts and former players as one of the best tennis seasons for a single player seen in history , with Tennis Magazine describing it as the third best tennis season ever , behind Roger Federer 's 2006 season , and Rod Laver 's in 1969 . Pete Sampras described it as \" one of the best achievements in all of sport . \" Djokovic 's dominance contributed to an overall control by the Big Four . They all reached the semifinals at two of the year 's Grand Slam events , and between them won every Masters tournament . Nadal was a clear second place behind Djokovic , winning the French Open and losing in both the Wimbledon and US Open final . Nadal ended the season with a 0 \u2013 6 losing record against Djokovic : every match they played was a championship final . By his standards , Roger Federer had a weak season : he failed to win a Grand Slam tournament title for the first time since 2002 , losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final , and the sixth time overall in Major finals . He dropped to world No. 4 in November , the first time he had been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002 . Federer 's drop was caused by Murray 's remarkable run of form in Asia in October , winning three successive titles . However , Federer rallied , winning his three final tournaments ( a sign of things to come in the subsequent season ) , including the World Tour Finals , which was enough to secure an end-of-season ranking of No. 3 . Murray , meanwhile , was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments , with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final by Djokovic . He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year , and five titles in total . The dominance of the Big Four continued in 2012 . Each player won one Grand Slam tournament : Djokovic won in Australia , Nadal in France , Federer at Wimbledon and Murray ( who hired former world number 1 Ivan Lendl as his head coach earlier in the year ) with his first Grand Slam tournament title at the US Open . This win \" cemented \" Murray 's position \u2013 who also won gold in the Olympic Games \u2013 as a member of the Big Four : his end of season ranking of third was his best yet . Djokovic entered the season as world number 1 , and remained there until July 2012 , when he was overtaken by Federer , who reclaimed the top spot for the first time since June 2010 . Federer subsequently overtook Sampras ' record of 286 weeks at the top , and ultimately extended the record to 302 weeks . Federer relinquished his world No. 1 ranking on 5 November , Djokovic reclaiming the top spot and ending the year at the top of the rankings for the second consecutive year . Djokovic was the only player to make at least the semifinals in all four Grand Slam events , and was the losing finalist at the French and US Open . Both he and Federer won three Masters tournaments , seeing them dominate the season as a whole . Federer was also the silver medalist at the Olympics , where Djokovic finished fourth . Nadal , meanwhile , had his season cut short by an injury . Having won two clay court Masters tournaments and the French Open , he was eliminated in the second round at Wimbledon \u2013 his first defeat at such an early stage in a Grand Slam tournament since 2005 . He later revealed that he had been injured going into the tournament , and he did not compete for the rest of the season , but still ended the year as world No. 4 . The 2013 season continued in similar fashion , with Djokovic , Federer and Murray occupying three of the four semifinal slots at the Australian Open , with Nadal still suffering from injury . Murray beat Federer in a five-set epic in the semifinal meaning all four members of the Big Four had beaten each other at least once in a Grand Slam event , subsequently losing to Djokovic in the final in four sets . As a result , Djokovic became the third man to win four Australian Open titles and the first to win three consecutively . Murray himself becoming the first man to reach the final of the next Grand Slam event after winning their maiden title . Nadal returned for the clay-court season , winning events in Rome , Barcelona , Madrid before becoming the only male player to win a Grand Slam tournament eight times by winning the French Open , defeating Djokovic in the semifinals . However , Djokovic did end Nadal 's eight-year winning streak at the Monte-Carlo Masters . Murray 's clay-court season ended prematurely because of a back injury and did not compete at the French Open , whereas Federer lost in the quarterfinals after making the final in Rome . Nadal and Federer lost early at Wimbledon in the first and second round respectively , thus ending Federer 's 36 consecutive Grand Slam tournament quarter final appearance record . Murray defeated Djokovic in the final to become the first British man to win the tournament in 77 years , extending his winning streak on grass to 18 matches . Leading up to the US Open , Nadal won ATP Masters 1000 events in Montreal and Cincinnati , his third hardcourt ATP Masters 1000 event of the year after winning at Indian Wells earlier in the year , extending his winning streak to 15 \u2013 0 on hardcourts for the year . He went on to win the US Open , defeating Djokovic in the final in four sets . While Murray and Federer lost early , in the quarterfinals and fourth round respectively . Overall , the season was about Nadal and Djokovic . Nadal won two Majors and five ATP Masters 1000 events . He was also runner-up at the ATP World Tour Finals . Djokovic won one Major , and reached two finals and a semifinal in the other three , and finished the year strongly on a 22-match winning streak , winning the ATP World Tour Finals in London . The 2013 head-to-head record of Nadal and Djokovic was tied at 3 \u2013 3 . A back injury ended Murray 's season prematurely and he finished fourth in the rankings , but was the only player besides Nadal and Djokovic to win a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 title , at Wimbledon and Miami respectively . Federer suffered his worst season for a decade . He reached just one Major semifinal , failed to win a single ATP Masters 1000 crown and finished the year sixth in the rankings with one title to his name , though he too suffered from a recurring back injury throughout the season . = = = 2014 and beyond : Djokovic 's dominance = = = As 2013 came to a close , Roger Federer 's fall in the rankings prompted many sources to debate whether or not the status of the Big Four had ended . This debate intensified in the wake of the Australian Open , which saw Stan Wawrinka defeat Djokovic in the quarter-final and Nadal in the final to win his first Slam title , marking just the second time since 2005 and the first since 2009 that a player outside the Big Four had won a Grand Slam tournament . Murray and Federer fell to sixth and eighth in the rankings respectively , and after the tournament , several players expressed the opinion that they were now capable of challenging the Big Four . However , the Big Four occupied all four final spots of the first two Masters 1000 titles of the year in Indian Wells and Miami , with Djokovic winning his fourth and fifth consecutive Masters titles with tight victories over Federer and Nadal respectively . The clay-court season started with Wawrinka winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Monte-Carlo , coming from behind to defeat Federer in the final . Nadal had failed to reach the final in Monte-Carlo for the first time since 2004 , and also lost his first match at Barcelona since 2003 , against Nicolas Almagro . A third loss , to Djokovic in the final of the Rome Masters , was the first time Nadal had lost more than two matches on clay in a season for a decade . He did , however , win the Madrid Masters , and went on to defend his French Open title , defeating Murray in the semi-final and Djokovic in the final , with Federer losing in the fourth round to Ernests Gulbis \u2013 the third time in his last four Grand Slam event appearances he failed to make the quarterfinals . Following his back surgery at the end of 2013 , Murray had struggled to return to form in the first half of the year , reaching only two semi-finals and losing to Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets in the quarter-finals while attempting to defend his Wimbledon title , a defeat which saw him fall to no . 10 in the world rankings . This , and Nadal 's loss to Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round , his third consecutive early-round loss at Wimbledon , led former players and experts , including Jimmy Connors , to express the opinion that the \" aura \" around the Big Four had faded . Milos Raonic , who reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon , suggested there was now a \" human side \" visible in the Big Four , which was giving players belief when facing them . However , Djokovic defeated Dimitrov and Federer beat Raonic to make it an all-Big Four final , the 24th they have contested . Djokovic defeated Federer in five sets to claim his second Wimbledon title , a result that left Djokovic , Nadal and Federer occupying the top three places in the rankings . At the Rogers Cup , Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Djokovic and Murray in the third round and quarter-finals respectively before defeating Federer in the final . Federer continued his return to form , winning his first Masters title since 2012 in Cincinnati . Later , he also won the Shanghai Masters , and returned to No. 2 in the rankings , overtaking Nadal , whose season had been curtailed by a wrist injury . The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four 's collective grip on the major titles slip still further , however , as Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic beat Djokovic and Federer in the semi-finals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 Australian Open , and the first time since 2003 that multiple first-time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season . Following the tournament , Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings , his first time outside the top 10 since 2008 . The tournament as a whole further signalled the decline of the Big Four 's dominance . Towards the end of the year , Andy Murray managed to return to form , winning three titles in Shenzhen , Vienna and Valencia , allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the Tour Finals , but he bowed out at the group stages following a humiliating defeat by Federer , in which he won just a single game . Indeed , throughout the year Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings . The 2014 season drew to a close with Djokovic winning the China Open title , extending his record at the event to 24 \u2013 0 , and the Paris Masters title . At the tour finals Federer and Djokovic both reached the final , but Federer withdrew citing injury following a brutal semifinal against Wawrinka . Federer recovered to win the Davis Cup as part of the Switzerland team for his , and the country 's , first triumph in the competition , leading many people to say that his tennis career was now complete . Collectively , the Big Four won 19 titles in 2014 , but two Slam titles and two Masters titles went to other players . In the end-of-year rankings , Djokovic , Federer and Nadal held the top three spots , with Murray in sixth . Following Murray 's strong end to 2014 and reaching the final of the 2015 Australian Open , he moved into the top four in the ATP rankings for the first time in over year , meaning that the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for the first time since early 2013 , slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet . However , Federer and Nadal both lost early in the third round and quarterfinals respectively , the first time in 12 appearances that Federer had lost before the semi-finals at the first Slam of the season . Djokovic won the title , as well as well as the first three Masters titles of the year in Indian Wells ( where the Big Four were the top four seeds in ATP Masters 1000 event for the time since 2012 ) , Miami and Monte-Carlo , defeating Murray in the final in Miami ( his seventh straight victory against the Brit ) and Federer in the final of Indian Wells respectively . With these victories , Djokovic became the only man to win the Indian Wells-Miami sweep on three separate occasions . Andy Murray 's strong form continued and on his return in the clay-court season he won his first title on a clay court in Munich . Then , in the Madrid Open , he defeated Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori to reach the final , where he defeated Nadal in straight sets to win his first Masters title on clay and first since 2013 . This was also the first time he had beaten another member of the Big Four in a Tour match since his victory in the final at Wimbledon 2013 , going into the match 0 \u2013 12 against the other members . The defeat saw Nadal slip to seventh in the rankings , his first time outside the Top 5 for more than a decade . Djokovic , returning after skipping Madrid , again defeated Federer in the final for his fourth Masters title of the year in Rome . Nadal suffered his worst European clay-court season in a decade , failing to win a single title and appearing in just one final , whereas Djokovic and Murray entered the second Grand Slam event of the year unbeaten on clay . Murray continued his clay court form during the French Open , defeating David Ferrer in the quarter-finals to set up a semifinal against Djokovic , who had defeated Nadal in straight sets in the opposing quarter . This was only Nadal 's second defeat at the French Open , seeing him drop to No. 10 in the rankings , while Federer had been knocked out by fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka in the quarter-final held the previous day . Djokovic emerged victorious over Murray in a five set match that was spread over two days but succumbed to Wawrinka in the final in four sets , Wawrinka 's second Slam title in two years . As the grass court season began , Nadal 's inconsistent form continued , as he won the title in Stuttgart before losing in the first round of Queen 's the following week and in the second round at the Wimbledon championships two weeks later . Murray went on to win Queen 's for a record-tying fourth time , whilst Federer went on to win an eighth title in Halle . They both reached the semifinals of Wimbledon with Federer emerging victorious over Murray in straight sets . Djokovic claimed the other spot in the final , seeing off Kevin Anderson in five sets in the fourth round along the way , to set up a rematch of the previous year 's final , and defeated Federer in four sets to win his second grand slam of the year , denying Federer a record eighth Wimbledon title for the second year in a row . Murray and Federer shared the two North American Hard Court Masters titles , at Montreal and Cincinnati respectively , with Djokovic being the losing finalist on both occasions . Murray 's victory over Djokovic in the Montreal final was his first in 2015 and followed eight successive losses against the Serb , and briefly saw him return to the No. 2 ranking , before Federer reclaimed the No. 2 position the following week , having defeated Murray in the semi-finals . Nadal meanwhile was defeated at the quarter-finals in Montreal and the third round in Cincinnati , and also suffered an early exit at the US Open . Murray was beaten by Kevin Anderson in the fourth round , his earliest defeat at a slam tournament since the 2010 US Open , but the final was contested by Djokovic and Federer . Djokovic won in four sets , giving him a third slam title of the season . Murray led Great Britain to Davis Cup victory in 2015 , winning all eight of a possible eight singles rubbers and becoming the latest member of the quartet to win the Davis Cup . = = = 2016 = = = In 2016 Djokovic collected his sixth Australian Open title in a straight sets victory over Murray . He followed up this solid run of form with a record setting fifth Indian Wells and record equaling sixth Miami masters titles . At the 2016 French Open , Djokovic again beat Murray in the final to become the third Big Four member after Federer and Nadal to complete a Career Grand Slam . Nadal withdrew from that year 's Wimbledon with a damaged wrist tendon , while a shock defeat for Novak Djokovic in the third round at the hands of the American Sam Querrey in four sets meant that only two of the Big Four were present in the tournament 's quarter-finals ; Federer and Murray . Federer lost his semifinal to Milos Raonic in five sets . In the final Murray beat Raonic in straight sets to win his second Wimbledon title , and third Grand Slam title overall . Murray 's victory marked the first time since the 2010 French Open that a member of the Big Four had won a Grand Slam title without having to defeat one of the other three members . Federer withdrew from the remainder of the 2016 season due to a knee injury , missing the 2016 Olympics and 2016 US Open . = = Overall dominance = = = = = Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympics = = = Since the 2005 Australian Open , the opening Grand Slam tournament of the 2005 ATP Tour , the Big Four have won both Olympic Games singles tournaments. all but four Majors , and all but two Tennis Masters Cups / ATP World Tour Finals . The dominance does not just consist of winning the events either , with all four members regularly making it to the latter stages of the tournament . Since 2010 they have occupied all but 4 finalist spots . Since 2008 they have occupied all four semifinal spots on four occasions , at the 2008 US Open , 2011 French Open , 2011 US Open & 2012 Australian Open , as well as taking three of the four spaces on nine other separate occasions . In 2011 they occupied 14 out of a possible 16 Grand Slam semifinal slots . In the same period , only twice have two or more not made the semifinal stage ( 2009 & 2010 French Open ) , while in 2012 they took 13 out 16 Grand Slam tournament semifinal slots . At the Olympics , members of the Big Four took two of the three available singles medals in 2008 and 2012 , and including doubles have a total of three golds , two silvers and a bronze from these games . Federer and Murray are the only members of the Big Four to have two Olympic medals , and Murray is the only one to have won two medals at the same tournament , taking both the singles ' gold medal and the mixed doubles ' silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Djokovic is the only member to not have won a gold medal in any event so far , having taken the singles ' bronze medal in 2008 . The Big Four , along with Rod Laver , Tony Roche and Ivan Lendl , are the only men in Open Era history to reach the semifinals at all four Majors in a single calendar year , Federer has achieved this a record 5 times in his career so far and Djokovic four times . However , this feat has been accomplished many more times in the pre-Open Era .

Djokovic leads with a record 29 titles followed by Nadal ( 28 ) , Federer ( 24 ) , and Murray ( 12 ) . Since 2005 , spanning 104 events , they have won 89 , since 2007 of the 85 they 've won 72 , since 2009 of the 68 events that have taken place , they 've won 61 and since 2011 of the 50 events that have taken place , they 've won 47 . This includes all 9 in 2011 , 2013 and 2015 . Moreover , between the 2010 Paris Masters and 2012 Paris Masters , they won 17 consecutive ATP Masters 1000 events . As of the 2013 Rome Masters , they had won 109 titles from 121 finals at all levels of the ATP Tour since the start of the 2008 season . Since the tournaments were revamped and renamed ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events at the beginning of 2009 , no player outside the Big Four has won more than one title . Of these ATP Masters events , excluding the Paris Masters ( where the Big Four have had less success , although they have still won it five times in the last seven years ) they have won : All but one Indian Wells Masters events since ( and including ) 2004 . All but two Miami Masters events since ( and including ) 2005 . All but one Monte-Carlo Masters event since ( and including ) 2005 . Every Rome Masters event since ( and including ) 2005 .

Although no player has won each of these 15 events in men 's singles , this feat has been achieved in men 's doubles by Canada 's Daniel Nestor and the United States ' Bryan Brothers , Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan . Djokovic matches the result in men 's singles of Andre Agassi , who ended his career having won 13 of these 15 events , achieving a Career Grand Slam ( winning all four Majors in a career ) , a Career Golden Slam ( winning all four Majors and the Olympic singles gold medal in a career ) , and what Sports Illustrated called a Career Super Slam ( winning all four Majors , the Olympic singles gold medal , and the ATP World Tour Finals ) . Federer and Nadal are one behind Djokovic , and within three of matching this feat of winning all 15 . Nadal has also achieved a Career Grand Slam and a Career Golden Slam , but has thus far fallen short of winning the Tour Finals , and the Miami Open and Paris Masters . Federer has also achieved a Career Grand Slam , but is missing the Olympic Gold in singles , and the Monte-Carlo Masters and Italian Open . Djokovic , as the only man to have won eight of the nine Masters events , is just a Cincinnati title away from achieving what has been labelled the Career Golden Masters , as well as needing the Olympic Gold to complete his overall tally . Murray , for his part , is still only about two-thirds of the way to the goal having won 9 of the 15 events .

Collectively they have won 87 of these 99 tournaments ( 88 % ) . Of the 12 tournaments they failed to win , they were runner-up in 6 of them , and 5 of these 12 tournaments occurred prior to them first being seeded as the Top 4 players ( post-US Open 2008 ) . Since this time in 2008 , the Big Four have won 58 of 65 tournaments ( 89 % ) . And starting with the 2010 Rome Masters , they had won 31 consecutive tournaments where all four were present , until the 2014 Australian Open .

As for tournaments where only one of the Big Four has competed , this is the only category where the rest of the field has a positive ratio , winning 186 of the 262 tournaments ( 71 % ) played overall . However , it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four 's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits .

Murray and Nadal have won Gold in Singles at the last two Olympic Games . Murray and Nadal were represented in 18 consecutive Major Finals from the 2010 Australian Open until the 2014 French Open , although they are yet to play each other in a Major final . Djokovic and Federer have had streaks of 14 or more Major semi-finals . Djokovic and Federer have had streaks of 28 and 36 consecutive quarterfinals appearances in the majors . The 2010 French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament since Wimbledon 2004 not to feature either Djokovic or Federer in the semi-finals . = = Legacy and recognition = = = = = Current and former professionals = = = Fellow top players , including David Ferrer , Tomas Berdych , Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Roddick have all spoken about the dominance of the Big Four and the challenge they face in matching them . While the question of breaking through the dominance of the Big Four is a constant question the rest of the tour are constantly asked , many former top professionals have also spoken about the topic , including Bj\u00f6rn Borg , Andre Agassi , Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic . At the 2011 Wimbledon Championships , 11-time Major champion Bj\u00f6rn Borg was quoted as saying : = = = Media = = = Since 2010 , when the Big Four increasingly began to dominate the tour as a group , most articles and reports concentrate solely on the members of the Big Four and their chances in upcoming tournaments or how the previous one has affected them , with smaller sections on the rest of the players . = = = Wider impact on the sport = = = For the most part , the presence of the Big Four is generally seen to have had a positive impact on tennis , making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention . However , with all four members being from European countries , this may have had a potentially negative effect on interest in North America . It has also argued the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring . = = = Murray 's position = = = Some tennis commentators , including Murray himself , have spoken of a \" Big Three \" or \" Trivalry \" , with Murray behind the other three players . Between September 2008 and January 2013 , Murray was the only one of the Big Four to have dropped outside of the top four rankings on the ATP Tour and is the only one never to have been ranked world number one . Also , he has an overall record of 28-54 versus the Big Three . However , Murray has a total of twelve Masters 1000 titles , eleven career Major finals , including victories at the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon ( defeating Djokovic in both finals ) and 2016 Wimbledon ( defeating Raonic in final ) , won the 2012 Olympic Games , made 27 Major quarter-finals and 20 semi-finals , and has been ranked world No. 2 a total of 45 weeks dating back to 17 August 2009 . This has led to him being reported as \" definitely part of the Big Four \" since 2010 . However , after losing his Wimbledon title defence to Grigor Dimitrov in the 2014 quarter-finals , Murray dropped to No. 10 in the world rankings , making this the first time in six years that he had been ranked this low . This was the culmination of a poor twelve months in which he failed to reach a final , or register a top ten victory , following his Wimbledon triumph in 2013 , after recovering from major back surgery at the end of 2013 . Following a strong end to the 2014 season , Murray finally ranked back in the top four in February 2015 along with the rest of the Big Four for the first time since the start of 2013 , slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet . Meanwhile , Roger Federer , by reaching the final , which he lost to Novak Djokovic , returned to number three in the world rankings , marking this the first time in two years that the top three places on the ATP World Rankings were all occupied by Djokovic , Nadal and Federer simultaneously . = = = \" Big Five \" proposals = = = Popular propositions have claimed that tennis has a \" Big Five \" , with either Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro , Marin \u010cili\u0107 or Stanislas Wawrinka expanding the Big Four . The most accepted theory centres around Wawrinka , since he has won two Grand Slam championships . As of July 11 , 2016 , he has won more Grand Slam singles titles than any active player outside the Big Four since September 3 , 2006 , when Andre Agassi retired ( and has won as many Grand Slams as Lleyton Hewitt , who retired on July 4 , 2016 ) . From Roland Garros 2015 until Wimbledon 2016 , Wawrinka also had as many Grand Slam titles to his name as Andy Murray . A testament to Stan Wawrinka 's suggested Big Five status is the fact that he is one of only three players outside the Big Four to have won a Grand Slam event between the 2005 Australian Open and 2016 Wimbledon . He is also one of only three players to have beaten each of the Big Four at Grand Slam level . Furthermore he defeated the world # 1 and world # 2 at each of his two grand slam titles . At the 2014 Australian Open , he beat world # 2 Djokovic 9-7 in the fifth set of the quarter-finals and then triumphed over world # 1 Nadal in 4 sets in the final . Then at the 2015 French Open , he defeated world # 2 Federer in straight sets during the quarter-finals before prevailing against world # 1 Djokovic in the final after losing the first set . By virtue of this win over Djokovic , Wawrinka handed him his only loss in a Grand Slam in 2015 and it also thwarted Djokovic 's chances to complete the career grand slam . Although the Big Four is often compared to successful tennis quartets of the past , some proponents of the Big Five concept have suggested that the dominant quartets in question were really quintets . For example , when considering the era of Borg , Connors , McEnroe and Lendl , Guillermo Vilas also springs to mind . Similarly , Mats Wilander was an integral part of the era that comprised Sampras , Edberg , Becker and Agassi . In like manner , such pundits argue , Stanislas Wawrinka is a quintessential player of the Big Four 's generation . At the 2016 Australian Open , during Stanislas Wawrinka 's fourth round matchup with Milos Raonic , local commentator Bruce McAvaney made the comment : \" I suppose it 's a big five , with Stan having the two Slams . \" Ahead of the semifinal encounter between Murray and Wawrinka at the 2016 French Open however , Wawrinka dismissed the idea of a Big Five , describing Murray as \" well ahead \" of him : = = = Golden era = = = Some , including Steffi Graf and John McEnroe , believe the presence of the Big Four has coincided with that of a new \" Golden Era \" in men 's tennis since 2010 , wherein depth , athleticism and quality have never been better . The era has been compared to that of Rod Laver , Ken Rosewall , Roy Emerson and John Newcombe throughout the 1960s and that of Bj\u00f6rn Borg , Jimmy Connors , John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl during the late 1970s and early 1980s . While Novak Djokovic himself recognises it as a golden era , Roger Federer remains skeptical : A comparison of the total top-level singles titles won by this current Big Four and other previous dominant quartets helps to put things in perspective . As the table below shows , the Big Four 's career tallies of Grand Slam tournament titles , Masters Series titles , and overall titles have already surpassed the other three quartets . They have also matched the top Year End Tour Finals tally . Note 1 An observation to make is that both Laver and Rosewall were banned from competing in Grand Slam tournaments during most of the 1960s.To quote Malcolm Knox a sports columnist \" If grand slams are taken as the benchmark , consider this . The pro tour put Laver out of 20 grand slams from age 23 to 28 in his prime \" . and instead competed in Professional Slam tournaments . The draw of the Pro majors was significantly smaller than the traditional tournaments of Grand Slam events ; usually they only had 16 or even less professional players . Though they were usually the top 16 ranked players in the world at the time . Note 2 The focus of the article is on singles achievements and excludes notable doubles and mixed doubles titles across all six selection criteria won by previous big four candidates . If you take all results into consideration , then the following grouping of Laver / Rosewall / Emerson / Newcombe would add another 57 combined titles making their figure 133 titles overall , if we take the Borg / Connors / Lendl / McEnroe group a further 40 combined titles would make their tally 168 titles overall , and the grouping of Edberg / Agassi / Sampras / Becker would include 12 additional doubles titles bringing their total to 105 titles overall . Roger Federer 's own comments above reflect these facts in defining a new Golden period of tennis , \" But then again we don 't play doubles . We don 't play mixed \" , \" but we have somewhat of a golden era right now \" , however Nadal has won 3 Masters 1000 doubles titles , and Federer has won 1 Masters 1000 doubles title and an Olympic gold medal in doubles , which would therefore add 5 more titles to the Big Four 's Top-Level tournament tally , bringing it to 157 titles overall . Note 3 Other notable big fours by previous decades achievements below ( excluding year end and Masters Series performances , as they did not exist ) . 1920s Henri Cochet , Ren\u00e9 Lacoste , Jean Borotra and Bill Tilden ( 62 Slams ) . 1930s Fred Perry , Jack Crawford , Don Budge and Ellsworth Vines ( 63 Slams ) . 1940s Bobby Riggs , Jack Kramer , Frank Parker and John Bromwich ( 47 Slams ) . 1950s Pancho Gonzales , Frank Sedgman , Tony Trabert and Lew Hoad ( 67 Slams ) . Another way to view a comparison of current Big Four and other previous dominant quartets . = = = Prize money = = = Djokovic , Federer , Nadal , and Murray make up the top four prize money leaders of all time ( not adjusted for inflation ) . = = Rivalries = = The respective rivalries between the Big Four are considered to be some of the greatest of all time . Between the four of them they have played 190 matches against each other , 55 of which were at Grand Slam events . This includes 28 Grand Slam tournament finals , as well as 25 Grand Slam semifinal meetings , more than any other group of four players .

Nadal has had to defeat one of the other three members 19 times in order to win his 14 titles . This includes 8 wins over Djokovic ( 4 finals , 3 semifinals , 1 quarterfinal ) , 7 wins over Federer ( 6 finals , 1 semifinal ) , and 4 wins over Murray ( 3 semifinals , 1 quarterfinal ) . Furthermore , in order to win 6 of his 14 titles , he has had to defeat two of the Big Four in the same tournament . On 3 occasions he has had to defeat Federer and Djokovic , on 2 occasions he has had to defeat Federer and Murray , and on 1 occasion he has had to defeat Djokovic and Murray . Djokovic has had to defeat one of the other three members 15 times in order to win his 11 titles . This includes 7 wins over Federer ( 3 finals , 4 semifinals ) , 5 wins over Murray ( 4 finals , 1 semifinal ) , and 3 wins over Nadal ( 3 finals ) . Furthermore , in order to win 4 of his 11 titles , he has had to defeat two of the Big Four in the same tournament . On 2 occasions he has had to defeat Federer and Murray , on 1 occasion he has had to defeat Nadal and Federer , and on 1 occasion he has had to defeat Nadal and Murray . Federer has had to defeat one of the other three members 9 times in order to win his 17 titles . This includes 4 wins over Djokovic ( 1 final , 2 semifinals , 1 round of 16 ) , 3 wins over Murray ( 3 finals ) , and 2 wins over Nadal ( 2 finals ) . Furthermore , in order to win 2 of his 17 titles , he has had to defeat two of the Big Four in the same tournament . On both of these occasions he had to defeat Djokovic and Murray . Murray has had to defeat one of the other three members 2 times in order to win his 3 titles . On both of these occasions he defeated Djokovic in the final . = = = Federer vs. Nadal = = = Federer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004 and their rivalry is a significant part of both men 's careers . It is also considered one of the greatest in history . They have played 34 times ( seventh-highest in Open Era history ) , most recently in the 2015 Basel final , and Nadal leads their eleven-year-old rivalry 23 \u2013 11 . They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 14 September 2009 , when Nadal fell to world No. 3 ( Andy Murray became the new No. 2 ) . They are the only pair of men to have ever finished four consecutive calendar years at the top , eventually with 6 years from 2005 to 2010 . Federer was ranked no . 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004 . Nadal , who is five years younger , ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008 . Nadal leads their head-to-head 23 \u2013 11 . Fifteen of their 34 matches have been on clay which is statistically Nadal 's best surface and Federer 's worst with 13 being in the final . Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts ( 7 \u2013 2 ) and clay ( 13 \u2013 2 ) , while Federer leads on grass ( 2 \u2013 1 ) and indoor hard courts ( 5 \u2013 1 ) . Because tournament seedings are based on rankings , 21 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 8 Grand Slam tournament finals . From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final . Nadal won six of the eight , losing the first two Wimbledon finals . Three of these finals were five set-matches ( 2007 and 2008 Wimbledon , 2009 Australian Open ) , with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts . 11 of their 32 meetings have reached a deciding set . They have also played in 10 Masters Series finals , including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours . They also contested the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets . = = = Djokovic vs. Nadal = = = Djokovic and Nadal have the most head-to-head meetings in Open Era history with 49 meetings , which Djokovic leads 26 \u2013 23 . Nadal leads on grass 2 \u2013 1 and clay 14 \u2013 7 , but Djokovic leads on hard courts 18 \u2013 7 . They have met 13 times in Grand Slam tournaments with Nadal leading 9 \u2013 4 , and 4 \u2013 3 in finals . The rivalry is listed as the third greatest rivalry in the 2000s decade by ATPworldtour.com and is widely considered to be the greatest rivalry in the history of the sport . Djokovic is the first player to have at least ten match wins against Nadal and the only person to defeat Nadal seven times consecutively . He is also only the second player to have defeated Nadal in more than one Grand Slam tournament final ( the other being Federer ) and the first to beat Nadal in a final on a surface other than grass . Their 2012 Australian Open encounter is considered by many to be the greatest match ever played and their 2012 French Open semifinal is considered the best clay court match ever played . Between 2011 \u2013 12 , they met in four consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals , just the second time in tennis history this has happened . In doing so , they also became the only players in history , except for Venus and Serena Williams , to have faced the same opponent in the finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events . Djokovic defeated Nadal in the first three ( from Wimbledon to the Australian Open ) , making Nadal the first player in history to lose three consecutive Grand Slam event finals . However , Nadal defeated Djokovic in the French Open final , denying him a Career Grand Slam and the opportunity to become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four Majors at once . The two also share the record for the longest Australian Open and Grand Slam tournament final match ever played ( 5 hours and 53 minutes ) , at the 2012 Australian Open final . This and the 2013 French Open semifinal they contested , are considered two of the greatest matches of all time . At ATP Masters 1000 level , they have met 25 times , 12 of which were in the final ( a record ) , including the 2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters , where Djokovic ended Nadal 's 47-match winning run and eight-year winning streak at the event . = = = Djokovic vs. Federer = = = Djokovic and Federer have played each other 45 times with Djokovic leading 23 \u2013 22 . Djokovic leads on grass 2 \u2013 1 , while they are tied 17 \u2013 17 on hard courts and 4 \u2013 4 on clay . In terms of number of matches played , it ranks as the second largest rivalry in the Open Era . The rivalry is the largest in Grand Slam tournament history with 15 matches played , having won against each other matches at each of the four Grand Slams . Djokovic leads this category 9 \u2013 6 ( they are tied 3 \u2013 3 at the US Open , 1 \u2013 1 at Roland Garros , and Djokovic leads 3 \u2013 1 in Australia and 2-1 in Wimbledon ) . They have played in four Grand Slam tournament finals , the 2007 US Open , which Federer won in straight sets and at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015 and the 2015 US Open , won by Djokovic . They 've also met in a record ten semifinals . The rivalry between Federer and Djokovic is considered one of the best in the Open Era . Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive Grand Slam tournaments ( 2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open ) , and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double-figure career wins over Federer . Djokovic is one of four players currently on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Major and the only player to do it three times . Between 2007 \u2013 2011 they played a record five times at the US Open ( tied with Lendl \u2013 McEnroe and Connors \u2013 Lendl ) , with Federer winning the first three and Djokovic the last two . This includes the 2010 and 2011 semifinals they contested , both of which Djokovic saved two match points before going on to win the match . In contrast Federer is the only player beside Nadal to have achieved 20 career wins against Djokovic and ended Djokovic 's 43-match winning streak and 41 \u2013 0 start to the 2011 season , by defeating him in the French Open semifinals . These three matches have been classified among the greatest matches in tennis history by the ATP . At ATP Masters 1000 level , they have met 18 times , and they are both tied 9 \u2013 9 , while Djokovic leads 4 \u2013 3 in finals . The pair have also contested one final at the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals , which Djokovic won in straight sets . They were scheduled to meet again in the 2014 final but Federer withdrew . The pair met four times in 2014 , in the semifinal of the Dubai Tennis Championships , with Federer recording his first victory over Djokovic since 2012 and first deciding set victory over another member of the Big Four since 2010 , in the final of Indian Wells the following week , with this time Djokovic coming out on top , Monte-Carlo semifinal with Federer winning in straight sets , and at Wimbledon , with Djokovic winning in five sets . They have met six times so far in 2015 , at the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships with Federer winning in straight sets , the final of the Indian Wells Masters with Djokovic winning in three sets , the final of the Rome Masters , which Djokovic won in straight sets , the final of Wimbledon , which Djokovic won in four sets , the final of the Cincinnati Masters , which Federer won in straight sets and 2015 US Open , which Djokovic won in four sets . = = = Djokovic vs. Murray = = = Djokovic and Murray have met 34 times with Djokovic leading 24 \u2013 10 . Djokovic leads 5 \u2013 1 on clay , 19 \u2013 7 on hard courts , and Murray leads 2 \u2013 0 on grass . The two are almost the same age , with Murray being a week older than Djokovic . The pair have met in six Grand Slam tournament finals : the 2011 Australian Open , 2012 US Open , 2013 Australian Open , 2013 Wimbledon Championships , 2015 Australian Open and 2016 Australian Open . Djokovic won in Australia four times , and Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon . Between 2012 \u2013 13 , the pair met nine times , including three Major finals , and were ranked as the two highest ranked players in the world between May and August 2013 . During this time , the rivalry rose in prominence as the emerging rivalry in tennis . Since then , Djokovic has dominated the rivalry , winning eight matches in a row , before Murray stopped his winning streak in the final of the 2015 Rogers Cup . The US Open final they contested equalled the record as the longest US Open final in history , as well as the second longest major final in Open Era history , behind the 2012 Australian Open final . It also featured the longest ever tie-break in a US Open final , with a 12 \u2013 10 final score in the first set . Other notable matches include a nearly five-hour-long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open , which Djokovic won 7 \u2013 5 in the fifth set , as well as a semifinal meeting at the 2012 Olympic Games , with Murray winning in straight sets . At ATP Masters 1000 level , they 've met thirteen times , with Djokovic leading 8 \u2013 5 . Eight of these meetings came in finals , and they are tied at 4 \u2013 4 . Their most notable match in this category was in the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters , where Djokovic saved 5 championship points to win the title , ending Murray 's perfect 12 \u2013 0 record at the event . This , and the three set match they played in Rome in 2011 , were voted the ATP World Tour Match of the Year , for each respective season . = = = Federer vs. Murray = = = Federer and Murray have met 25 times , with Federer leading 14 \u2013 11 . Federer leads 12 \u2013 10 on hard courts and 2 \u2013 1 on grass , and they have never met on clay . Overall , Federer leads Murray 5 \u2013 1 in Grand Slam events , three of which were finals , once each at the US Open , Australian Open and Wimbledon Championships , all of which Federer won . However , Murray leads their head-to-head 9 \u2013 8 in three-set tennis , leading 6 \u2013 3 at ATP Masters 1000 level ( 2 \u2013 0 in finals ) with Federer ahead 3 \u2013 1 in the matches they 've contested at the ATP World Tour Finals , with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008 and Federer coming out victorious in London in 2009 , 2010 and in 2012 . In 2012 , exactly four weeks after the two met in the Wimbledon final , they met again on Centre Court for the final of the Olympic Games . Murray exacted revenge on Federer by winning in straight sets for the loss of just 7 games , claiming the gold medal and at the same time denying Federer a Career Golden Slam . Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories against Federer , the other two being Nadal and Djokovic . The pair have only met three times since 2012 , with Murray recording his first victory over Federer at Grand Slam event level with a five set victory in the semifinals of the 2013 Australian Open , and Federer reversing the result in the quarterfinal the following year . Federer won their meeting at the 2014 Cincinnati Masters quarter-final in straight sets . = = = Murray vs. Nadal = = = Murray and Nadal have met on 24 occasions , on all surfaces and at every Grand Slam tournament , with Nadal leading 17 \u2013 7 . Nadal leads 7 \u2013 2 on clay , 3 \u2013 0 on grass and 7 \u2013 5 on hard courts . The pair regularly meet at Grand Slam tournaments , with nine of their meetings coming at this level , with Nadal leading 7 \u2013 2 ( 3 \u2013 0 at Wimbledon , 2 \u2013 0 at the French Open and 1 \u2013 1 at both the Australian & US Open ) . The pair are the only match-up within that of the Big Four that have not contested a Grand Slam tournament final , despite one of them occupying a finalist spot in every final between the 2009 US Open and 2014 Wimbledon Championships . However , they 've met in 6 semi-finals and 2 quarter-finals , making the rivalry an important part of both men 's careers . In 2011 the pair met in three consecutive Grand Slam tournament semi-finals from the French Open to the US Open , with Nadal defeating Murray every time . Murray leads 3 \u2013 1 in ATP finals , with Nadal winning Indian Wells in 2009 and Murray winning the two ATP 500 finals they 've contested in Rotterdam the same year and Tokyo in 2011 , as well as Madrid in 2015 . The pair did not meet in 2012 or 2013 , partly because both Murray and Nadal suffered from injury . However , they renewed their rivalry in 2014 with a quarter-final meeting at the Rome Masters , with Nadal winning in three tight sets . The pair met again in the semi-finals of French Open two weeks later , with Nadal winning comfortably in straight sets on his way to winning his ninth French Open title . = = = Head-to-head records vs other players = = = As of June 2 , 2016 , a total of 101 different players have played against each member of the Big Four at least once . The following table presents the Big Four 's Head-to-head records against the only 14 players that have posted at least 1 victory against each of them , hth as well as their records against the only 2 players who have posted at least 1 victory over 3 of them and have also won at least 10 matches overall .

The 2008 Wimbledon final and the 2012 Australian Open finals are considered the greatest matches of all time , . Novak Djokovic saved match points against Roger Federer at the 2010 and 2011 US Open semifinals , whereas Federer ended Djokovic 's 43-match winning streak in the 2011 French Open semifinals . The 4 hour 50 minute 2012 Australian Open semifinal between Murray and Djokovic is said to have given Murray the belief he needed to match the other members of the Big Four . Moreover , every Grand Slam tournament final of 2012 , all played between the Big Four , holds some historical significance . The 2012 Australian Open final was the longest Grand Slam tournament final in terms of time played , the 2012 French Open saw Rafael Nadal break the record for the most number of titles at the French Open , whereas Djokovic was attempting to become the first man to hold all four Majors since Rod Laver in 1969 . The 2012 Wimbledon final saw Federer equal the record for most Wimbledon titles when he came out victorious against Murray , who become the first British man since 1938 to appear in the final . The 2012 US Open final was the equal longest final in US Open history , and Murray became the first British man since 1938 to win a Major title , and the only British man to do so in the Open Era . He also became the only man to win Olympic Singles Gold and the US Open back-to-back . = = = 2007 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2007 Wimbledon Gentlemen 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships . It pitted world No. 1 Roger Federer against world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in a Major final for the fourth time . This was a rematch of the Wimbledon final from the year before and would become the defining match of the Federer \u2013 Nadal rivalry up to that point . This was a historic match as Federer was trying to equal Bj\u00f6rn Borg 's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles , while Nadal was attempting to be the first man since Borg in 1980 to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back ( this achievement is colloquially known as the \" Channel Slam \" ) . Federer defeated Nadal in five compelling sets in three hours and forty-five minutes , for a fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship ( equalling the feat achieved by Bj\u00f6rn Borg ) . Borg himself returned to Wimbledon for the first time since losing the final in 1981 , saying \" I just feel that this is the right time for me to come back , to hopefully watch Roger winning his fifth title in a row to match my record . \" This match marked only the third time in the new century that a Major final had gone to five sets , and was the first time the technology Hawk-Eye was ever used in a Wimbledon final . = = = 2008 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2008 Wimbledon Gentlemen 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships . A part of the storied rivalry between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , it pitted the two players , then ranked world No. 1 and No. 2 respectively , against each other in a Major final for the sixth time ( out of eight ) . After 4 hours and 48 minutes , Nadal defeated Federer in five sets in failing light . A number of tennis critics promptly lauded it as the greatest match in tennis history . This was the longest Wimbledon men 's singles final in history , clocking in at four hours and forty-eight minutes . The match also featured numerous rain delays which meant the match finished in near darkness , at 21 : 15 BST , almost seven hours since the match started at 14 : 35 BST . It was to be the last Wimbledon final to be significantly affected by rain , as a retractable roof was being installed at Centre Court and would be in place by the 2009 Wimbledon Championships . = = = 2009 Australian Open final = = = The 2009 Australian Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2009 Australian Open . It was contested between the world 's top two players for much of the previous four years , Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer then world number 's 1 and 2 respectively . It was their seventh ( out of eight ) Grand Slam tournament final meeting and it was the same final match up as had been previously at both the 2008 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final and 2008 French Men 's Singles final , both of which Nadal won . However this was Rafael Nadal 's first Major hardcourt final while it was Roger Federer 's ninth and was yet to lose in a Major hardcourt final . Nadal defeated Federer in 5 sets in 4 hours and 19 minutes , with the match finishing after midnight , to become the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open . The match was lauded as one of the greatest ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time , only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final . It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all-time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by Pete Sampras and the open-era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with Andre Agassi ( he would go on to achieve these in the near future ) . However , as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records , holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career . Not only that but he became the first man in the open-era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time . This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that . The defeat brought Federer to tears as he came to terms with his loss . The match statistics followed a similar pattern to those at the 2008 Wimbledon Final , with Federer having a lower first serve percentage against Nadal ( 51 % vs 64 % ) and he again couldn 't be as clincical on break point opportunities with only 31 % break points converted for Federer whereas Nadal converted 43 % of his break points . However the total points by each player proved even closer that that at that Wimbledon final , as Federer won 1 more point than Nadal ( 174 vs 173 ) yet still lost this final . = = = 2010 US Open final = = = The 2010 US Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2010 US Open . It pitted then-world No. 1 Rafael Nadal against then-world No. 3 Novak Djokovic in a Major final for the first time , having previously met four times at this level ( one quarter-final and three semi-finals , all won by Nadal ) . This was the first US Open final reached by Nadal , having previously fallen in the semi-finals in the previous two years , while for Djokovic , this was the first Major final he reached since winning his then-only Major title at the 2008 Australian Open . To reach the final , both players had to beat their semi-final opponents in contrasting circumstances : Nadal easily defeated Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets , while Djokovic saved several match points in the fifth set to overcome Roger Federer in five sets , thus denying what would have been the first ever Federer-Nadal final at Flushing Meadows . Nadal defeated Djokovic in four sets in three hours and forty-three minutes , to win his first US Open title , and thus complete the Career Golden Slam ( equalling the feat achieved by Andre Agassi ) . He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows , became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open , Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the second man after Laver to hold two Major titles on each surface ( hard , clay and grass ) . The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships . This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months . = = = 2011 French Open semifinal = = = The 2011 French Open Men 's Singles semifinal between world No. 2 Novak Djokovic and world No. 3 Roger Federer was a historic encounter that brought about the end of the longest winning streak in almost 30 years . Djokovic entered the match undefeated for the first five months of the year having gone 41 \u2013 0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches ( his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals ) . It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer . Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011 , however , Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets . Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was clear that if the match went to a fifth set it would have to be continued the next day . Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5 \u2013 4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker . Federer then played Nadal in the final , which was their record eighth encounter in a Grand Slam tournament final . Nadal defeated Federer for the fifth time at Roland Garros and tied Bj\u00f6rn Borg 's record of six French Open titles . = = = 2012 Australian Open final = = = The 2012 Australian Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2012 Australian Open . It pitted the world 's top two players , Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal , against each other in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fourth time ( out of seven ) and third consecutive time . Djokovic defeated Nadal in five sets to win the match . At five hours and fifty-three minutes , it was the Major final match with the longest duration in history . During the trophy ceremony , both Nadal and Djokovic required chairs , as they were both so tired that they couldn 't stand . It was lauded as one of the greatest matches ever by former players , legends , and analysts of the sport . John McEnroe claimed it surpassed the 2008 Wimbledon final as the best tennis match of all time , while legends Pete Sampras , Mats Wilander , and Bj\u00f6rn Borg said it was the best match they saw in their lifetime . After the 2012 Australian Open , Rod Laver came out with his greatest in the amateur and Open Era lists , Djokovic was ranked 6th and Nadal 5th on the Open Era list . Laver said the 2012 Australian Open final was a main reason for including both players . Nadal called it the toughest loss of his career but the best match he ever played . Djokovic said it was the finest win in his career and also commented on the high level of tennis played . Not only was this the longest Grand Slam tournament final , but according to Tennis Channel and the Australian Open TV networks , this was one of the most-watched finals , despite ending late into the night locally . Soon after the conclusion of the 2012 Australian Open , there were sources claiming that Djokovic sealed his spot as a tennis great and in the Tennis Hall of Fame . = = = 2012 French Open final = = = The 2012 French Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2012 French Open . It pitted the world 's top two players , Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal , against each other in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fifth time overall and fourth consecutive time . This match had historical proportions as Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors simultaneously , whereas Nadal was looking to break Bj\u00f6rn Borg 's record of six French Open titles and equal Chris Evert 's record of seven French Open titles held by a man or woman . Nadal defeated Djokovic in a two-day final in four sets , to ultimately achieve his seventh French Open title and deny Djokovic a Career Grand Slam . With Nadal leading by two sets to one , and Djokovic leading 2 \u2013 1 on serve in the fourth set , the match was suspended due to rain ; it was initially thought that Djokovic had gained the momentum , having won eight consecutive games prior to the suspension of the match , however , Nadal was able to regroup and take the fourth set , and ultimately the match , after Djokovic double-faulted on championship point down . = = = 2012 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2012 Wimbledon Gentlemen 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Gentlemen 's Singles tournament at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships . It pitted world No. 3 Roger Federer against world No. 4 Andy Murray in a Major final for a third time . This final snapped a streak of four consecutive Major finals reached by Djokovic and Nadal . Nadal was ousted in the second round while Federer defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals . In what was the most historic Major final of the year , Federer sought to win a record shattering seventeenth Major title and a record-tying seventh Wimbledon to match his idol Pete Sampras . Both of these records are amongst the most prestigious in all of tennis . Murray on the other hand had become the first British man since Bunny Austin in 1938 to reach the Wimbledon final , and was attempting to become the first Briton to win any Major title since Fred Perry in 1936 . Federer defeated Murray in four riveting sets in three hours and forty-four minutes , to capture a record equalling seventh Wimbledon championship , and a record breaking seventeenth Major title . The victory was also historic as it caused Federer to depose Djokovic as world No. 1 and break Sampras ' record of 286 weeks at the summit of men 's tennis ( Federer had been just one week short when he lost the number one ranking in June 2010 ) . At the beginning of the third set play was halted by rain and the roof which had been installed in 2009 was closed for the first time during the Wimbledon final . = = = 2012 US Open final = = = The 2012 US Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2012 US Open . It pitted then-world No. 3 Andy Murray against world No. 2 and defending champion Novak Djokovic in a Grand Slam tournament final for the second time . Murray defeated Djokovic in five sets to win the match . It was the equal-longest US Open men 's final in history , lasting four hours and fifty-four minutes ( equalling the 1988 US Open final played by Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander ) , and the equal second-longest men 's final in the Open era , only behind the aforementioned 2012 Australian Open final . By winning the 2012 US Open , Murray became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a Grand Slam singles title , and the first British man in the Open Era to do so . This was the most famous match in the rivalry between the two players . It also marked a milestone for Murray , as it was his 100th match win at a Major . This match featured the longest ever first set ( and the longest ever tiebreak ) in a men 's championship match ; the 87-minute first set , won by Murray , included four breaks of serve in the first four games of the match , a 54-shot rally in the sixth game , and the 24-minute tiebreak which lasted up until 12 \u2013 10 ; additionally , the tiebreak included two 30-shot rallies . Murray required six set points to win the first set , and required five sets to win the match . Murray said that a toilet break at the end of the fourth set helped him to restore his concentration after Djokovic took the third and fourth sets . = = = 2013 Australian Open final = = = The 2013 Australian Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2013 Australian Open . It pitted world No. 1 Novak Djokovic against world No. 3 Andy Murray in a Major final for the second time in as many Grand Slam tournaments and third time overall . Djokovic was looking to become just the third man in the Open Era to win the Australian Open four times and the first to win it three consecutive times . Murray , by reaching the final , had become the first man to reach the final of the next consecutive Grand Slam tournament after winning their first title . Murray took the first set on a tie-break just as he had done in the US Open final the previous year , and while the second set followed a similar pattern with no breaks of serve , this time Djokovic took the tie-break . One break of serve in the eighth game ( two hours and 52 minutes into the contest ) was enough for Djokovic to take the third set before taking the fourth 6 \u2013 2 comfortably against a tired-looking Murray , who needed four hours to defeat Federer in the semifinal just two days before . The match lasted three hours and 40 minutes and four sets . By winning Djokovic won his sixth Grand Slam tournament title to tie him with greats such as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg , whereas Murray equalled Edberg 's feat of three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open . = = = 2013 French Open semifinal = = = The 2013 French Open Men 's Singles semifinal was a rematch of the prior year 's final between Nadal and Djokovic . Just weeks after that victory , Nadal went on a lengthy injury hiatus of over 7 months before his highly successful return , reaching the final of all 8 tournaments he entered and winning 6 titles . But one of those losses was to Djokovic in Monte Carlo , ending Nadal 's record streak of 8 consecutive titles there . Djokovic was very motivated to win this match , having said winning his first French Open title was his highest priority of 2013 , plus his desire to dedicate the title in honor of his recently deceased childhood tennis coach . The match was a see-saw five setter with Nadal prevailing 9 \u2013 7 in the fifth after 4 hours and 37 minutes . Analyst Steve Tignor summed it up : \" This epic was a mirror image of their last one , in the 2012 Australian Open final . That day it had been Nadal who had survived a near-death experience in the fourth set , won it in a tiebreaker , and taken a 4 \u2013 2 lead in the fifth before watching Djokovic storm back for the title . Today it was Nole who broke Rafa at 3 \u2013 4 in the fourth and again at 5 \u2013 6 , grabbed that set in a tiebreaker , and led 4 \u2013 2 in the fifth before watching Nadal take it all away . In each of those matches , the loser was haunted by a stunning , crucial lapse . In Australia , with a chance to go up 5 \u2013 2 in the fifth , Nadal had missed the easiest of backhand passing shots . In Paris , serving at 4 \u2013 3 in the final set , Djokovic gave away a point when he ran into the net after hitting what would have been a winning overhead . \" Numerous tennis pundits and legends including Ivan Lendl , Andre Agassi , Bjorn Borg , Boris Becker , and John McEnroe claimed this was the greatest clay court match to ever take place in tennis history . ESPN commentator Chris Fowler and Patrick McEnroe even echoed this very remark during the broadcast of this match . Nadal then won the title for the fourth consecutive year . This was his 8th overall French title , making him the first man to win 8 titles at any Grand Slam tournament . His opponent was David Ferrer , who was the first Slam finalist outside the Big Four since Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych three years prior at Wimbledon . = = = 2013 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2013 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships .

After three hours and nine minutes , second seeded Murray defeated world No. 1 Djokovic in three sets to win the match . By winning the 2013 Wimbledon Championships , Murray became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win the Wimbledon title , the first Scottish man since Harold Mahony in 1896 to win the title , and the first British man in the Open Era to do so . = = = 2014 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2014 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final was the championship match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships . A significant part of the Djokovic \u2013 Federer rivalry , it pitted Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer against each other in a Grand Slam tournament final for the second time . After three hours and 56 minutes , top-seeded Djokovic defeated fourth-seeded Federer in five sets to win the match . By winning the 2014 Wimbledon Championships , Djokovic not only won for the second time , but also reclaimed the world number one ranking from Rafael Nadal at the conclusion of the tournament . He also stopped a losing run in Grand Slam tournament finals having lost his last 3 and 5 of his last 6 , Meanwhile , with his run to the final and showing in the final that he is still a major contender even at the age of 32 , Federer returned to the top 3 ranking positions after a lengthy period in the ranks 5 \u2013 8 range . Federer had been going for his 80th career tour title , 18th Major victory and his 8th Wimbledon title . = = = 2015 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2015 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final was the championship match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships , featuring a rematch of last year 's final between Djokovic and Federer . Djokovic , the top seed , defeated Federer , the second seed , again , this time in four sets . = = = 2016 French Open final = = = It was the first time in nearly two decades that number 1 played number 2 and neither had won the French Open previously . Andy Murray had a career resurgence on clay , making deep runs in the Masters tournaments prior to the French Open , finishing runner up to Djokovic in Madrid before besting him in Rome . Rain had affected the tournament schedule and in Djokovic 's case , he had to play 4 matches in 5 days . Murray was playing to become the first Brit since 1937 to win , while Djokovic had multiple historical records on the line , most notably joining the elite group of men who won a career grand slam and joining Rod Laver and Don Budge as the only men in the Open Era to hold all 4 Grand Slam titles at the same time . After Murray took the first set , Djokovic rallied to win the match prevailing 3-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 .",

Her major coaching relationship was with Stefan Ortega who was a regular guest in her player 's box and helped advance her game . After a series of poor finals ' results Kuznetsova ended her relationship with the Sanchez-Casal academy in 2009 and moved to Moscow on the advice of Roger Federer to start training with experienced Russian coach Olga Morozova . They ended their relationship after the BNP Paribas Open in March 2009 , after which Kuznetsova was without a coach . As of May 2009 her coach was former Russian tennis player and Fed Cup coach Larisa Neiland .

Carlsen is a former chess prodigy . He became a Grandmaster in 2004 , at the age of 13 years , 148 days . This made him the third youngest grandmaster in history . In November 2013 Carlsen became World Champion by defeating Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship 2013 . On the May 2014 FIDE rating list , Carlsen reached his peak rating of 2882 , which is the highest in history . He successfully defended his title in November 2014 , once again defeating Anand . The same year , he also won the World Rapid Championship and the World Blitz Championship , thus holding all three world championship titles . In 2015 Carlsen won the inaugural Grand Chess Tour , a series of three supertournaments featuring the 10 best chess grandmasters in the world . Carlsen was known for his attacking style as a teenager , but he has since developed into a more universal player . He does not rely on opening preparation as much as other top players , and plays a variety of openings in order to make it more difficult for opponents to prepare against him . Carlsen 's positional mastery and endgame prowess have drawn comparisons to those of former world champions Bobby Fischer , Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca , Vasily Smyslov , and Anatoly Karpov . = = Childhood = = Carlsen was born in T\u00f8nsberg , Norway , on 30 November 1990 , to Sigrun \u00d8en and Henrik Albert Carlsen , both engineers ( sivilingeni\u00f8r ) by profession . The family spent one year in Espoo , Finland , and then in Brussels , Belgium , and in 1998 returned to Norway and settled in Lommedalen , B\u00e6rum . They later moved to Haslum . Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age : at two years , he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles ; at four , he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10 \u2013 14 . His father taught him to play chess at the age of 5 , although he initially showed little interest in the game . The first chess book Carlsen read was Find the Plan by Bent Larsen , and his first book on openings was Eduard Gufeld 's The Complete Dragon . Carlsen developed his early chess skills by playing by himself for hours at a time \u2014 moving the pieces around the chessboard , searching for combinations , and replaying games and positions shown to him by his father . Simen Agdestein emphasises Carlsen 's extreme memory , claiming that he was able to recall the areas , population numbers , flags and capitals of all the countries in the world by the age of five . Later , Carlsen had memorised the areas , population numbers , coat-of-arms and administrative centres of \" virtually all \" Norwegian municipalities . Carlsen participated in his first tournament \u2014 the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship \u2014 at the age of 8 years and 7 months , scoring 6 \u00bd / 11 . Carlsen was later coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country 's top player , Grandmaster ( GM ) Simen Agdestein , who in turn cites Norwegian football manager Egil \" Drillo \" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy . In 2000 , Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbj\u00f8rn Ringdal Hansen , an International Master ( IM ) and former Norwegian junior champion , as Ringdal served a one-year siviltjeneste ( an alternative civilian service programme ) at the college . Over the course of this year , Carlsen 's rating rose from 904 in June 2000 , to 1907 . Carlsen 's breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000 , where Carlsen scored 3 \u00bd / 5 against the top junior players of the country , and a performance rating ( PR ) of about 2000 . Apart from chess , which Carlsen studied about three to four hours a day , his favourite pastimes included football , skiing , and reading Donald Duck comics . Carlsen also practiced ski jumping until the age of ten . His personal best is 21 metres . From autumn 2000 to the end of 2002 , Carlsen played almost 300 rated tournament games , as well as several blitz tournaments , and participated in other minor events . In October 2002 , he placed sixth in the European Under-12 Championship in Pe\u00f1iscola . In the following month , he tied for first place in the World Under-12 Championship in Heraklio , placing second to Ian Nepomniachtchi on tiebreak . After this , he obtained three IM norms in relatively quick succession ; his first was at the January 2003 Gausdal Troll Masters ( score 7 / 10 , 2345 PR ) , the second was at the June 2003 Salongernas IM-tournament in Stockholm ( 6 / 9 , 2470 PR ) , and the third and final IM norm was obtained at the July 2003 Politiken Cup in Copenhagen ( 8 / 11 , 2503 PR ) . He was officially awarded the IM title on 20 August 2003 . After finishing primary school , Carlsen took a year off to participate in international chess tournaments held in Europe during the fall season of 2003 , returning to complete secondary education at a sports school . During the year away from school , he finished in a tie for third in the European Under-14 Championship and placed ninth in the World Under-14 Championship . Both events were won by Sergei Zhigalko . = = Chess career = = = = = 2004 = = = Carlsen made headlines after his victory in the C group at the Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee . Carlsen obtained a score of 10 \u00bd / 13 , losing just one game ( against the highest-rated player of the C group , Du\u0161ko Pavasovi\u010d ) . As a result of the victory , he earned his first GM norm , and achieved a PR of 2702 . Particularly notable was his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round , when Carlsen sacrificed material to give mate in just 29 moves . The first 23 moves in that game had already been played in another game \u2014 Almagro Llanas \u2013 Gustafsson , Madrid 2003 ( which ended in a draw ) \u2014 but Carlsen 's over-the-board novelty immediately led to a winning position . Carlsen 's victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in 2005 , and it led Lubomir Kavalek , writing for the Washington Post , to give him the title \" Mozart of chess \" . Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory and played an unusually wide range of openings . Carlsen 's prowess caught the attention of Microsoft , which became his sponsor . Carlsen obtained his second GM norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February . On 17 March , in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjav\u00edk , Iceland , Carlsen defeated former World Champion Anatoly Karpov . The blitz tournament was a preliminary event leading up to a rapid knockout tournament beginning the next day . In that event , Carlsen was paired with Garry Kasparov , then the top-rated player in the world . Carlsen achieved a draw in their first game and lost the second one , and was thus knocked out of the tournament . In the sixth Dubai Open Chess Championship , held 18 \u2013 28 April , Carlsen obtained his third and final GM norm . This caused him to become the world 's youngest GM at the time , as well as the third-youngest GM in history ( after Sergey Karjakin , who earned the title at the age of 12 years and 7 months and Parimarjan Negi ) . Carlsen played in the FIDE World Chess Championship , thus becoming the youngest player ever to participate in one , but was knocked out in the first round by Levon Aronian . In July , Carlsen and Berge \u00d8stenstad ( then the reigning Norwegian champion ) tied for first in the Norwegian Chess Championship , each scoring 7 / 9 . A two-game match between them was arranged to decide the title . Both games were drawn , which left \u00d8stenstad the champion because he had superior tiebreaks in the tournament . = = = 2005 = = = In the Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen International Chess Festival 2004 \u2013 05 , Carlsen defeated Alexei Shirov , then ranked No. 10 in the world , as well as the co-winner of the tournament . In the semifinals of the Ciudad de Le\u00f3n rapid chess tournament in June , Carlsen played a four-game match against Viswanathan Anand , who was ranked No. 2 in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid Chess Championship . Anand won 3 \u2013 1 . In the Norwegian Chess Championship , Carlsen again finished in shared first place , this time with his mentor Simen Agdestein . A playoff between them was played between 7 and 10 November . This time , Carlsen had the better tiebreaks , but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores in the event of a 1 \u2013 1 draw had been revoked previously . The match was closely fought \u2014 Agdestein won the first game , Carlsen the second \u2014 so the match went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner . Carlsen won the first rapid game , Agdestein the second . Then followed three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth rapid game . At the end of 2005 , Carlsen participated at the Chess World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk , Russia . In the knockout tournament , he upset the 44th-ranked Zurab Azmaiparashvili in round one , and proceeded to defeat Farrukh Amonatov and Ivan Cheparinov to reach the round of 16 . There , Carlsen lost to Evgeny Bareev , but then won against Jo\u00ebl Lautier and Vladimir Malakhov before losing again to Gata Kamsky . Thus , Carlsen finished in tenth place and became the youngest player to be an official World Championship Candidate . In October , he took first place at the Arnold Eikrem Memorial in Gausdal with a score 8 / 9 and a PR of 2792 . = = = 2006 = = = Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first-place finish in Corus group C in 2004 . His shared first place with Alexander Motylev with 9 / 13 ( + 6 \u2212 1 = 6 ) qualified him to play in the Corus group A in 2007 . At the traditional international ' Bosna ' tournament in Sarajevo 2006 , Carlsen shared first place with Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu ( who won on tiebreak evaluation ) and Vladimir Malakhov ; this could be regarded as Carlsen 's first \u201c A \u201d elite tournament win , although it was not a clear first . Carlsen was close to winning the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright , but a last-round loss to Berge \u00d8stenstad dropped him into another tie for first place with Agdestein . It also prevented Carlsen from beating Agdestein 's record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever . Nonetheless , in the playoff held from 19 \u2013 21 September , Carlsen won 3 \u2013 1 . After two draws at standard time controls , Carlsen won both rapid games in round two , securing his first Norwegian championship win . Carlsen won the Glitnir Blitz Tournament in Iceland .

Carlsen then played in a rapid tournament 28 \u2013 30 August at the Arctic Securities Chess Stars tournament in Kristiansund , Norway . The field featured World Champion Viswanathan Anand , female world No. 1 Judit Polg\u00e1r , and Jon Ludvig Hammer . In the preliminary round robin , Carlsen scored 3 \u00bd / 6 to qualify for the final , second behind Anand . In the final , Carlsen defeated Anand 1 \u00bd \u2013 \u00bd to win the championship . Following this event , Carlsen suffered setbacks in his next two tournaments . In the 39th Chess Olympiad from 19 September to 4 October , he scored 4 \u00bd / 8 , losing three games , to Baadur Jobava , Michael Adams , and Sanan Sjugirov ; these were his first losses with the black pieces in more than a year . His team , Norway , finished 51st out of 149 teams . Carlsen 's next tournament was the Grand Slam Masters Final on 9 \u2013 15 October , which he had qualified for automatically by winning three of the previous year 's four Grand Slam chess events ( 2009 Nanjing Pearl Spring , 2010 Corus , 2010 Bazna Kings ) . Along with Carlsen , the finals consisted of World Champion Anand and the highest two scorers from the preliminary stage held in Shanghai in September : Kramnik and Shirov . The average Elo of the participants at the time was 2789 , making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history . In the first round , Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik ; this was Carlsen 's second consecutive loss to Kramnik , and placed his hold on the world No. 1 ranking in serious jeopardy . In his second round , Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand ; this was his first loss as White since January 2010 . Carlsen recovered somewhat in the latter part of the tournament , achieving a win over Shirov , and finishing with 2 \u00bd / 6 . The tournament was won by Kramnik with 4 / 6 . Carlsen finished this tournament with a rating of 2802 , two points behind Anand at 2804 who temporarily ended Carlsen 's reign at world No. 1 . These setbacks called into question from some whether Carlsen 's activities outside chess , such as modelling for G-Star Raw , were distracting him from performing well at the chessboard . Carlsen said he did not believe there was a direct connection . Carlsen 's next tournament was the Pearl Spring chess tournament on 19 \u2013 30 October in Nanjing , China , against Anand , Topalov , Vugar Gashimov , Wang Yue , and \u00c9tienne Bacrot . This was the only tournament in 2010 to feature Anand , Carlsen and Topalov , at the time the top three players in the world , and was the first tournament in history to feature three players rated at least 2800 . With early wins over Bacrot , Wang Yue , and Topalov with white , Carlsen took the early lead , extending his winning streak with white in Nanjing to eight . This streak was halted by a draw to Anand in round seven , but in the penultimate round Carlsen secured first place by defeating Topalov with black . This was his second victory in the tournament over the former world No. 1 ; his final score of 7 / 10 ( with a PR of 2903 ) was a full point ahead of runner-up Anand . In the World Blitz Championship , held in Moscow on 16 \u2013 18 November , Carlsen attempted to defend his 2009 title . With a score of 23 \u00bd / 38 , he finished in third place behind Radjabov and winner Levon Aronian .

Carlsen won the London Chess Classic on 8 \u2013 15 December in a field comprising World Champion Anand , Vladimir Kramnik , Nakamura , and British players Adams , Nigel Short , David Howell , and Luke McShane . Carlsen had a rocky start , losing his games to McShane and Anand in rounds 1 and 3 , but winning with white against Adams and Nakamura in rounds 2 and 4 . He joined the lead with a win over Howell in round 5 , and managed to stay in the lead following a harrowing draw against Kramnik in round 6 , before defeating Short in the last round . Since the tournament was played with three points for a win , Carlsen 's + 4 \u2212 2 = 1 score put him ahead of Anand and McShane who scored + 2 = 5 ( a more traditional two-points-for-a-win system would have yielded a three-way tie , with Carlsen still on top , having the better tiebreaker due to four games with black \u2014 Anand and McShane played only three times with black ) . = = = 2011 = = = Carlsen competed in the GM-A group of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament ( formerly called Corus Chess Tournament ) on 14 \u2013 30 January in Wijk aan Zee in an attempt to defend his title ; the field included World Champion Viswanathan Anand , Levon Aronian , former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik , Alexander Grischuk , Hikaru Nakamura , Ruslan Ponomariov , among others . Despite losing games with white against Anish Giri and reigning Russian champion Ian Nepomniachtchi , Carlsen finished with 8 / 13 , including victories over Kramnik and tournament winner Nakamura . Although Carlsen 's performance raised his rating from 2814 to 2815 , Anand 's 8 \u00bd / 13 score elevated his rating to 2817 , making him the world No. 1 for the March 2011 FIDE rating list . The first tournament victory of the year came in the Bazna Kings tournament , a double round robin played in Media\u0219 , Romania on 11 \u2013 21 June .

The Grand Slam Chess Final was held as a double round robin with six players , in S\u00e3o Paulo ( 25 September \u2013 1 October ) and Bilbao ( 5 \u2013 11 October ) . Although Carlsen had a slow start , including a loss against bottom-ranked Francisco Vallejo Pons , he finished + 3 \u2212 1 = 6 , equal with Ivanchuk ( whose + 4 \u2212 3 = 3 finish was equal due to three points for a win ) . Carlsen then won the blitz tiebreak against Ivanchuk . The other players were Anand , Aronian , Nakamura , and Vallejo Pons . Another tournament victory was achieved in the Tal Memorial in Moscow 16 \u2013 25 November as a round robin with ten players . Carlsen won two games , against Gelfand and Nakamura , and drew the rest . Although he finished equal on points with Aronian , he placed ahead since the tiebreak was determined by the number of black games ; Carlsen had five black games , while Aronian only had four . In the London Chess Classic , played 3 \u2013 12 December , Carlsen 's streak of tournament victories ended when he finished third , behind Kramnik and Nakamura . Carlsen won three games and drew five . Although he did not win the tournament , Carlsen gained rating points , rising to a new personal record of 2835 . = = = 2012 = = = At the Tata Steel Chess Tournament held on 14 \u2013 29 January in Wijk aan Zee , Carlsen finished in a shared second place with 8 / 13 , behind Aronian , and equal with Radjabov and Caruana .

As in the Tal Memorial earlier in 2012 , Carlsen managed to finish the tournament without any losses ( + 4 \u2212 0 = 6 ) . He also defeated the winner Wang in both of their individual games . In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament , Carlsen was eliminated ( + 1 \u2212 2 = 0 ) in the first round by \u00c9tienne Bacrot . Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round . Carlsen would have won the classical tournament on the traditional 1 \u2013 \u00bd \u2013 0 scoring system , with 7 / 10 . The Grand Slam Chess Final was again held as a double round robin with six players , in S\u00e3o Paulo and Bilbao .

Carlsen lost the first game , but won the second one , and in the tiebreak defeated Polg\u00e1r 2 \u2013 0 . Carlsen won the London Chess Classic in December with five wins ( over McShane , Aronian , Gawain Jones , Adams and Judit Polg\u00e1r ) and three draws ( against Kramnik , Nakamura and Anand ) . This win , the third time Carlsen had won the tournament in the past four years , increased his rating from 2848 to a new record of 2861 , breaking Kasparov 's 13-year record of 2851 . By rating performance , this was one of the best results in history , with a PR of 2994 . = = = 2013 = = = Carlsen played in the 75th Tata Steel Chess Tournament from 11 to 27 January in Wijk aan Zee .

The Chess Oscar , conducted by the Russian chess magazine 64 , is awarded to the year 's best player according to a worldwide poll of leading chess critics , writers , and journalists . The Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang ( VG ) has awarded him \" Name of the Year \" ( \u00c5rets navn ) twice , in 2009 and 2013 . VG also named him \" Sportsman of the year \" in 2009 and in the same year he won the Folkets Idrettspris , a people 's choice award from the newspaper Dagbladet . In 2011 , he was given the Peer Gynt Prize , a Norwegian honour prize awarded annually to \" a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society \" ; the following year , he repeated as winner of Folkets Idrettspris . In 2013 , Time magazine named Carlsen one of the 100 most influential people in the world . = = Playing style = = Carlsen had an aggressive style of play as a youth , and , according to Agdestein , his play was characterised by \" a fearless readiness to offer material for activity \" . Carlsen found as he matured that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the world elite . When he started playing in top tournaments he was struggling against top players , and had trouble getting much out of the opening . To progress , Carlsen 's style became more universal , capable of handling all sorts of positions well . Carlsen opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4 , as well as 1.c4 , and , on occasion , 1.Nf3 , thus making it harder for opponents to prepare against him . Evgeny Sveshnikov has criticised Carlsen 's opening play , claiming in a 2013 interview that without a more \" scientific \" approach to preparation , his \" future doesn 't look so promising \" . Garry Kasparov , who coached Carlsen from 2009 to 2010 , said that Carlsen has a positional style similar to that of past world champions such as Anatoly Karpov , Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca , and Vasily Smyslov , rather than the tactical style of Alexander Alekhine , Mikhail Tal , and Kasparov himself . According to Carlsen , however , he does not have any preferences in playing style . Kasparov said in 2013 that \" Carlsen is a combination of Karpov [ and ] Fischer . He gets his positions [ and ] then never lets go of that bulldog bite . Exhausting for opponents . \" Carlsen has also stated that he follows in the traditions of Karpov and Fischer , but also mentions Reuben Fine as a player who \" was doing in chess similar to what I am doing . \" Anand has said of Carlsen : \" The majority of ideas occur to him absolutely naturally . He 's also very flexible , he knows all the structures and he can play almost any position . ... Magnus can literally do almost everything . \" Kasparov expressed similar sentiments : \" [ Carlsen ] has the ability to correctly evaluate any position , which only Karpov could boast of before him . \" In a 2012 interview , Vladimir Kramnik attributed much of Carlsen 's success against other top players to his \" excellent physical shape \" and his ability to avoid \" psychological lapses \" , which enables him to maintain a high standard of play over long games and at the end of tournaments , when the energy levels of others have dropped . Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen 's playing style : \" Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities , namely his ' nettlesomeness , ' to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan . Using computer analysis , you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes . Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric , because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes . In contrast , a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves , and of course he is very strong , but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response . \" Carlsen 's endgame prowess has been described as among the greatest in history . Jon Speelman , analysing several of Carlsen 's endgames from the 2012 London Classic ( in particular , his wins against McShane , Aronian , and Adams ) , described what he calls the \" Carlsen effect \" : ... through the combined force of his skill and no less important his reputation , he drives his opponents into errors . ... He plays on for ever , calmly , methodically and , perhaps most importantly of all , without fear : calculating superbly , with very few outright mistakes and a good proportion of the \" very best \" moves . This makes him a monster and makes many opponents wilt . = = Rating = = = = = Rating achievements = = = In the January 2006 FIDE list , at the age of 15 years , 32 days , he attained a 2625 Elo rating , which made Carlsen the youngest person to surpass 2600 Elo ( the record has since been broken by Wesley So , Wei Yi and John M. Burke ) . In the July 2007 FIDE list , at the age of 16 years , 213 days , Carlsen attained a 2710 Elo rating , which made him the youngest person to surpass 2700 Elo ( the record has since been broken by Wei Yi at the age of 15 years , 9 months ) . On 5 September 2008 , after winning round 4 in the Bilbao Grand Slam chess championship , Carlsen , just 17 years , 280 days old , briefly became No. 1 on the unofficial live ratings list . Carlsen 's September \u2013 October 2009 victory in the Nanjing Pearl tournament raised his FIDE rating to 2801 , making him at age 18 years , 336 days , the youngest player ever to break 2800 . The youngest before him was Vladimir Kramnik at age 25 . Before Carlsen , only Kasparov , Topalov , Kramnik , and Anand had achieved a 2800 + rating . After the Tal Memorial ( November 2009 ) he became No. 1 on the unofficial live chess rating list with his new peak rating of 2805.7 , 0.6 point over the No. 2 ranked player , Veselin Topalov . The FIDE rankings from January 2010 , which took into account the 16 games played at the Tal Memorial and the London Chess Classic , were enough to raise Carlsen 's rating to 2810 . This meant that Carlsen started 2010 by being , at the age of 19 years , 32 days , the youngest ever world No. 1 , and also the first player from a Western nation to reach the top of the FIDE rating list since Bobby Fischer in 1971 . The press coverage of this feat included an interview and article in Time magazine . The March 2010 FIDE rating list showed Carlsen with a new peak rating of 2813 , a figure that only Kasparov had bettered at that time . On the January 2013 FIDE rating list , Carlsen reached 2861 , thus surpassing Garry Kasparov 's 2851 record from July 1999 . On list from May 2014 , Carlsen achieved an all-time high record of 2882 . = = Head-to-head record versus selected grandmasters = = ( Rapid , blitz and blindfold games not included ; listed as + wins \u2212 losses = draws as of 23 Jul 2016 . ) Players who have been undisputed World Champion in boldface = = Notable games = = All links in this section lead to an external site .

In 2012 , Carlsen was featured in a 60 Minutes segment , and appeared as a guest on The Colbert Report . He was also interviewed by Rainn Wilson for SoulPancake . Carlsen was selected as one of the \" sexiest men of 2013 \" by Cosmopolitan . In August 2013 , Carlsen became an ambassador for Nordic Semiconductor . As of 2012 , Carlsen is the only active chess professional with a full-time manager . Espen Agdestein , brother of Carlsen 's former trainer Simen , and a FIDE Master and twice member of the Norwegian team at the Chess Olympiads , began working as an agent for Carlsen in late 2008 . His work consisted initially of finding sponsors and negotiating media contacts , but since 2011 , he has taken over management tasks formerly performed by Carlsen 's father Henrik . Carlsen reportedly earned roughly US $ 1.2 million in 2012 , the bulk of which was from sponsorships . In October 2013 , Carlsen started his majority-owned company , Play Magnus AS . Based in Oslo , Norway , Play Magnus ' first product is an iOS app that allows a user to play a Magnus Carlsen-tuned chess engine at 21 different ages ( from ages 5 to 25 ) . The chess engine was created using a database of thousands of Carlsen 's recorded games from the age of 10 . Carlsen 's goal is to use Play Magnus as a platform to encourage more people to play chess . In 2008 during a Q & A session with Nettavisen , when Carlsen was asked whether he had a form of autism spectrum disorder , he replied \" well , isn 't that obvious ? \" In December 2013 , in an interview with Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang , he clarified that he had meant \" obviously not \" , and said that he considers himself to have \" normal social skills and to be functioning normally . \" In February 2014 , Carlsen appeared in G-Star Raw 's Spring / Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole . = = Books and films = = Valaker , O ; Carlsen , M.

She is the 2008 Olympic individual all-around champion , the 2005 and 2007 world champion on the balance beam , and the 2005 world champion on the uneven bars . She is also a four-time all-around U.S. national champion , winning twice as a junior and twice as a senior . With nine World Championships medals , seven of them individual , Liukin is tied with Shannon Miller for the third-highest tally of World Championship medals ( among U.S. gymnasts ) . Liukin also tied Miller 's record as the American gymnast having won the most medals in a single non-boycotted Olympic Games . Liukin was a key member of the U.S. senior team . She represented the United States at three World Championships and one Olympic Games . In October 2011 , Liukin announced that she was returning to gymnastics with the hopes of making a second Olympic team . Liukin did not make the 2012 Olympic team , after several falls at the Olympic Trials and other pre-Olympic events , and retired from the sport in 2012 . = = Personal life = = Liukin was born on October 30 , 1989 , in Moscow , Russia SFSR , Soviet Union . She is the only child of two former Soviet champion gymnasts : 1988 Summer Olympics gold medalist Valeri Liukin and 1987 world clubs champion in rhythmic gymnastics Anna Kotchneva . Liukin and her family are members of the Russian Orthodox church . Her nickname Nastia is a Russian diminutive for Anastasia . The family immigrated to the United States when Nastia was two and a half years old , following the breakup of the Soviet Union , and settled first in New Orleans before moving to Texas . In 1994 , Valeri Liukin teamed up with another former Soviet champion athlete , Yevgeny Marchenko , to open the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy ( WOGA ) in Plano , Texas . Liukin is fluent in English and Russian . She graduated from Spring Creek Academy , located in Plano , Texas , in the spring of 2007 . She enrolled as a freshman international business major at Southern Methodist University in January 2008 , and took a leave from classes to concentrate on preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games . She returned to campus in spring 2009 , but her travel schedule and professional commitments caused her to withdraw before the end of the semester . She stated that she hoped to continue her studies at New York University in the future . Nastia 's signature color is pink , hence her pink leotard worn during the 2008 Beijing Olympics all-around competition . Liukin updates a blog on her official website and regularly posts on Twitter as @ NastiaLiukin . She has a line of GK Elite leotards and grips and a line of pink gymnastics equipment from AAI . People Magazine claimed that Liukin was in a relationship with American figure skater Evan Lysacek in a February 2010 article , but Lysacek denied the rumors in an interview with Entertainment Tonight , stating that the two were just \" very close friends . \" In January 2013 , Liukin began college at New York University , where she is studying sports management and psychology . In May 2016 , she graduated from NYU . On June 1 , 2015 , Nastia Liukin became engaged to her boyfriend , Matt Lombardi , a former Boston College hockey player . She announced the engagement on Instagram , with a photo of her ring and her fiance in the background , with the caption \" So this just happened ... \" = = Junior career = = Liukin began gymnastics at the age of three because she was \" always hanging around in the gym \" with her parents , who could not afford a babysitter to look after her while they were working as coaches .. Liukin 's parents initially did not aspire for their daughter to become a gymnast , knowing the pressure of high-level competition firsthand , but relented when they noticed her aptitude for the sport . Liukin competed in her first National Championships as a junior in 2002 , at the age of 12 and a half . In contrast to her WOGA teammates Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise , who finished first and second , respectively , Liukin suffered a fall on the uneven bars that rendered her unable to finish the routine . She continued through the rest of the competition and , despite the incomplete bars set , finished 15th , which landed her one of the final spots on the U.S. National Team . She was chosen to compete with the U.S. team at the 2002 Junior Pan American Championships , where she contributed to the team gold medal and placed second on the uneven bars and balance beam and in the all-around . By 2003 , Liukin was one of the strongest junior gymnasts in the United States . She won the junior division of the U.S. National Championships , as well as gold medals on three of the four events : uneven bars , balance beam and floor exercise . She repeated these accomplishments in 2004 . Liukin was a member of the gold-medal winning U.S. team at the 2003 Pan Am Games ; she took second place in the all-around behind fellow American Chellsie Memmel . She also won the all-around in the junior division of the 2004 Pacific Alliance Championships . Born in 1989 , Liukin was ten months too young to compete as a senior in 2004 , and thus was not eligible for a place on the U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens . Her scores in the junior division at the 2004 U.S. National Championships were competitive with those being posted by the seniors , and Marta Karolyi , the U.S. national team coordinator , has said that if Liukin had been eligible , she would have been named to the Olympic team . = = Senior career = = = = = 2005 \u2013 2006 = = = In 2005 , Liukin won her first senior National Championships and , once again , earned gold medals on the bars and beam . At the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne , she finished second in the all-around behind teammate Chellsie Memmel with a score of 37.822 . In event finals , she won the gold on the uneven bars and balance beam and the silver on the floor exercise . In March 2006 , Liukin placed first in the all-around at the American Cup . At the 2006 Pacific Alliance Championships , Liukin tied with teammate Memmel for first in the all-around , won the uneven bars title and a silver medal on beam , and contributed to the U.S. team 's gold-medal performance . She competed at the 2006 U.S. Classic as the defending all-around champion , but falls on the uneven bars and floor resulted in a fourth-place finish . However , she scored extremely well on the balance beam and was the only competitor in the meet , junior or senior , to earn a score over 16.00 on this event . After that when she was interviewed on ABC television show Dancing with the stars , she said , \" After that , I realized that it 's not all about winning . It 's about the journey . \" In late August , at the 2006 U.S. National Championships , Liukin successfully defended her all-around , beam and bars titles , becoming a two-time senior national champion . She was named to the U.S. team for the 2006 World Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus , Denmark , and was expected by many to be a strong contender for the all-around title . However , because of an ankle injury sustained in training before the competition began , she was only able to compete on one event , the uneven bars . In spite of her injury , in the qualification round , Liukin 's bars set earned a 16.2 , the highest score of any competitor on any apparatus in the meet . Her bars routine in team finals scored a 15.7 and helped the U.S. team win the silver medal . Liukin also qualified for the event finals on bars , where she took a small step on her dismount and finished with a 16.05 , earning a silver medal behind Britain 's Beth Tweddle . = = = 2007 = = = Liukin 's ankle injury required surgery , and the recovery period kept her out of both national and international competition for much of the year . In July 2007 , although she was still recovering from her injury , she returned to competition as a member of the American team for the Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro . She competed only on bars and beam , contributing to the team 's gold-medal finish and winning individual silver medals in the uneven bars and balance beam finals . Despite limited training time on floor and vault in the summer of 2007 , Liukin opted to compete all-around at the 2007 U.S. National Championships . She posted the highest score of the entire meet on bars and the second highest score on beam on the second day of competition , winning the senior bars title for the third year in a row and placing second on beam . However , she also suffered several falls and errors on floor and vault , and finished in third place overall , more than five points behind Shawn Johnson , the all-around gold medalist . Following Nationals , Liukin was named to the American team for the World Championships in Stuttgart , Germany , where she competed all-around in the team qualifying round and on bars and beam in the finals . Liukin 's score for her bars routine in team finals was a 16.375 , the highest score of the day and , in the end , the entire World Championships . However , at the end of her beam routine , her foot slipped while she was setting up her dismount , prompting her to change her usual skill , a two and a half twisting salto , to a simple back tuck . While she lost credit for her dismount , she also avoided a deduction for a fall , and earned a 15.175 . The team recovered from this and other mistakes to finish first overall with 184.400 , nearly a point ahead of the silver-medal Chinese . Liukin 's struggles with the balance beam continued in the all-around final , where she fell from the apparatus during her flight series . In spite of a 16.100 on bars , the highest score of the day from any competitor on any event , she finished the competition in fifth place . In the event finals , however , Liukin rallied and regained her world champion title on the balance beam with a score of 16.025 . She also earned a silver on the uneven bars behind Russia 's Ksenia Semenova , scoring a 16.300 after taking a step on her dismount . = = = 2008 = = = Liukin 's first meet of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City , where she defeated 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title . She posted the highest score of the meet , a 16.600 on the uneven bars . In March , Nastia competed at the Pacific Rim ( formerly Pacific Alliance ) Championships in San Jose , where she led the American team to a gold medal and won the all-around and balance beam titles . In the team competition , Liukin posted an all-time high score of 16.650 on the uneven bars , but in event finals , she fell on her Gienger release move and took a step on her dismount , earning a 15.225 and taking second place . At the 2008 U.S. National Championships in Boston , Liukin fell on the floor on her double front tuck the first day of competition , but had a strong meet on her other events and placed second in the all-around behind Shawn Johnson . She regained her national champion title on the beam and defended her national title on the uneven bars for the fourth consecutive year , scoring a 17.050 in preliminaries and a 17.100 in finals , the highest recorded score for any American gymnast at any event since the advent of the new Code of Points . In June , Liukin competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in Philadelphia , finishing second behind Johnson and earning a berth on the American team for Beijing . = = = = 2008 Olympics = = = = Liukin performed all-around in the qualifying round of competition . She fell on her dismount from the uneven bars , but nevertheless qualified to the all-around final with a score of 62.375 , which ranked her second among all competitors and 0.35 points behind Shawn Johnson , her friend and Olympic roommate . Liukin also qualified to three event finals : beam , uneven bars ( in spite of the fall ) and floor exercise . In the team finals , Liukin performed on three events : beam , bars and floor exercise . Her uneven bars score of 16.900 was the highest mark awarded in the entire Olympic competition . Liukin performed second on balance beam , matching her qualifying score of 15.975 . On floor exercise , she stepped out of bounds on her first tumbling pass , incurring a 0.1-point penalty , with a final score of 15.200 . The American team earned the silver medal , 2.375 points behind China . On August 15 , Liukin performed clean routines on all four events ( sticking her landings on three out of four events ) to win the all-around gold medal with a final score of 63.325 . Shawn Johnson took the silver medal with a score of 62.725 . The win marked the third time that an American woman had won the Olympic all-around title ; Mary Lou Retton and Carly Patterson were the two previous American gold medalists . It was also the fourth time in the history of the Games that two athletes from the same country had taken first and second place in the women 's all-around . The last time this was accomplished was the 2000 Olympics , when Romanian gymnasts won gold and silver ; Soviet gymnasts also won gold and silver all-around medals at the 1952 and 1960 Games . In the event finals , Liukin displayed a beautiful routine to earn a surprising bronze medal on floor exercise with a score of 15.425 , behind Shawn Johnson , with 15.500 , and Romanian Sandra Izbasa , with 15.650 . On uneven bars , Liukin and China 's He Kexin both posted final marks of 16.725 and earned identical A- and B-panel scores of 7.70 and 9.025 , respectively . However , He Kexin won the gold medal , and Liukin was awarded the silver , after a tie-breaking calculation that took into account individual marks given by judges on the B-panel . In the balance beam final , Liukin scored 16.025 to claim silver behind Shawn Johnson 's 16.225 . With her fifth Beijing medal , Liukin tied Mary Lou Retton and Shannon Miller for the most gymnastics medals won by an American in a single Olympic Games . Following her success in Beijing , Liukin was named the USOC Female Athlete of the Month ( August ) and ultimately USOC Co-Sportswoman of the Year alongside swimmer Natalie Coughlin ; the Women 's Sports Foundation Individual Sportswoman of the Year ; FIG Athlete of the Year and USAG Sportswoman of the Year . In addition , she was ranked third in the Associated Press ' 2008 Female Athlete of the Year voting . In March 2009 , Liukin was announced as one of 12 semifinalists for the AAU Sullivan Award . The annual award honors the athlete who best represents \" the qualities of leadership , character , sportsmanship , and the ideals of amateurism . \" On April 15 , 2009 , Liukin 's Olympic teammate Shawn Johnson won the AAU Sullivan Award . = = = 2009 = = = Liukin decided that she was not done with gymnastics and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic , where she competed only on balance beam . She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong . Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships , but decided to once again just perform on beam . She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team . Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp . However , she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she felt that she was not quite up to World Championships standards . = = = 2012 = = = After several months of conditioning , training , revamping routines and showing readiness at summer training camp , Liukin petitioned for a spot at the Visa National Championships . In order for the petition to be granted , she had to show readiness by scoring at least a 14.0 on one apparatus at a qualifying event ( the U.S. Secret Classic ) on May 26 . She did so , scoring a 14.9 on balance beam , and her petition was thereby accepted by USA Gymnastics and the selection committee . On beam at the Visa Championships , Liukin scored a 15.1 on night one , followed by a 14.1 on night two to place sixth on the event . On bars , she placed a disappointing 20th after scoring a 13.150 on night one and 13.650 on night two . Despite this , Liukin was chosen to compete at the Olympic Trials . Liukin 's gymnastics career came to an end after the 2012 Olympic Trials . On the final night of competition , she fell off the bars on her Gienger release , but got back up to finish her routine and landed her first competitive dismount since her comeback . After falling , she was helped up by her coach ( father ) to continue her routine . Her bars routine received a 13.950 . After she finished her beam routine , which scored a 14.950 , she received a standing ovation from the 18,000 fans in the HP Pavilion in San Jose . Despite the end of her gymnastics career , Liukin went to London as the athlete representative for the International Gymnastics Federation ( FIG ) . = = Routines = = Liukin was known for her long , expressive lines and flexibility .

There are both junior and senior fields for the competition , and the competition takes place the Friday prior to the AT & T American Cup , which occurs on the next day , Saturday . The incentive of the competition is to give pre-elite athletes the experience and opportunity to compete on a raised podium surface as well as in a large arena , which is not the norm for average USAG Optional competitions .

                    "text": "Georgetown Hoyas = The Georgetown Hoyas are the athletics teams that officially represent Georgetown University in college sports . Part of the NCAA 's Division I , the Hoyas field 23 varsity level sports teams , most of which participate in the Big East Conference , with the exception of the Division I FCS Patriot League in football . In late 2012 , Georgetown and six other Catholic , non-FBS schools announced that they were departing the Big East for a new conference . The rowing and sailing teams also participate in east coast conferences . The men 's basketball team is the school 's most famous and most successful program , but Hoyas have achieved success in a wide range of sports . The team name is derived from the mixed Greek and Latin chant , \" Hoya Saxa , \" ( meaning \" What Rocks \" ) which gained popularity at the school in the late nineteenth century . The name Hoyas came into use in the 1920s . Most teams have their athletic facilities on the main campus of Georgetown University . The men 's basketball team plays most of their home games at the Verizon Center in downtown Washington , D.C. and the baseball team plays at Shirley Povich Field in Cabin John , Maryland . Lee Reed took over as the school 's athletic director in April 2010 . = = Traditions = = = = = The word \" hoya \" = = = The University admits that the precise origin of the term \" Hoya \" is unknown . At some point before 1893 , students well-versed in classical languages combined the Greek hoia or hoya , meaning \" what \" or \" such \" , and the Latin saxa to form Hoya Saxa ! , or \" What Rocks ! \" This cheer may either refer to the stalwart defense of the football team , or to the baseball team , which was nicknamed the \" Stonewalls \" , or to the actual stone wall that surrounds the campus . After World War I , the term \" Hoya \" was increasingly used on campus , including for the newspaper and the school mascot . In 1920 , students began publishing the campus 's first sports newspaper under the name The Hoya , after successfully petitioning the Dean of the College to use it instead of the proposed name , The Hilltopper . \" Hilltoppers \" was also a name sometimes used for the sports teams . By the fall of 1928 , the newspaper had taken to referring to the sports teams as the Hoyas . This was influenced by a popular half time show at football games , where the mascot , a dog nicknamed \" Hoya , \" would entertain fans . Georgetown 's unique team name has caused opponents to mock Georgetown with chants including \" What 's a Hoya ? \" Harrison High School , located in Kennesaw , Georgia , is the only other institution in the country licensed to share this name . However , Georgetown Preparatory School , which separated from the University in 1927 , uses the name \" Little Hoyas \" for its sports teams and shares the University 's blue and gray color scheme . = = = Mascot = = = Georgetown 's nickname is The Hoyas , but its mascot is \" Jack the Bulldog . \" Various breeds of dogs have been used by the sports teams as mascots since the early 1900s . Several notable bull terriers like Sergeant Stubby and \" Hoya \" were used at football games in the 1920s , as was a Great Dane in the 1940s . However , in 1951 , the school suspended its football program because of the increasing cost of the game financially and academically , which left the school without an official live mascot . In 1964 , the school permitted exhibition football games to resume , and students financed the purchase of a young English bulldog named Royal Jacket , whom they intended to rename \" Hoya \" , but he only responded to the callname \" Jack \" . This breed was chosen to represent the school because of their \" tenacity . \" The athletics department subsequently adopted as its logo a drawing of a bulldog sporting a blue and gray freshman beanie . The original Jack retired in 1967 , but the name was carried over to his successors . In 1977 , the university began the tradition of dressing up a student in a blue and gray bulldog costume , replacing the live bulldog , though several dogs periodically joined the costumed mascot during the 1980s and 1990s . In 1999 , Scott R. Pilarz , S.J. , with the help of the Hoya Blue fan club , revived the tradition of an official live bulldog named Jack , to work along with the costumed mascot . When Pilarz left for the University of Scranton in 2003 , taking Jack with him , Georgetown secured a new bulldog puppy and found another Jesuit , Christopher Steck , S.J. , to care for him . The current bulldog is named \" John S. Carroll , \" a play on the name of Georgetown 's founder , which name allows for continuation of the \" Jack the Bulldog \" nickname . After Jack injured his leg in 2012 , two Georgetown parents donated a younger bulldog puppy , who the school refers to as \" Jack Jr . \" = = = Colors = = = Blue and gray are the official colors of Georgetown University and its athletic teams . The colors are an important reminder of the school 's past . During the American Civil War , Prussian blue was commonly used in Union uniforms , while cadet grey was used in Confederate uniforms . These colors were introduced by the rowing team in 1876 , who deemed blue and gray \" appropriate colors for the [ Boat ] Club and expressive of the feeling of unity between the Northern and Southern boys of the College . \" Girls from neighboring Georgetown Visitation sewed the original uniforms together for the team and presented the Boat Club with a blue and gray banner reading \" Ocior Euro \" ( Swifter than the Wind ) . The basketball and lacrosse teams use gray as their primary color in home jerseys , with blue in away jerseys . White is also frequently used as an accent to these colors , and is actually the main color in the football and baseball teams ' away jerseys and the soccer team 's home jerseys . Campus spirit groups often encourage students to \" bleed Hoya blue , \" a slogan used on teeshirts and bumper stickers sold to fans . Fans are generally encouraged to wear gray to home games , and sellouts are referred to as a \" gray out . \" Though various shades are used , the primary ones suggested by the school 's identification policy are pantone 409 and pantone 282 , which is the same shade as Oxford Blue . = = = Fight song = = = The Georgetown Fight Song , known as \" There Goes Old Georgetown \" , is actually an amalgamation of three songs , only the oldest of which , 1913 's \" The Touchdown Song \" , contains the lyric \" here goes old Georgetown \" . Students combined a version of \" The Touchdown Song \" with \" Cheer for Victory \" , written in 1915 , and \" The Hoya Song \" , written in 1930 , both of which are included in their entirety . The authors of these songs , and of the combined version , are unknown . Georgetown 's fight song is rare among U.S. university fight songs for mentioning other colleges by name . Specifically , it mentions Yale University , Harvard University , Princeton University , College of the Holy Cross , the United States Naval Academy , and Cornell University , who were all rivals of Georgetown in the early to mid-20th century , and mocks their fight songs . In recent years the Hoyas only play Cornell and Holy Cross regularly ( in football ) , and many of these schools no longer use the fight songs that Georgetown 's song mocks . = = Varsity sports = = Georgetown University fields 23 varsity level sports teams , 11 men 's teams , 11 women 's teams , and one co-ed team .

Georgetown 's first intercollegiate men 's basketball team was formed in 1907 . John Thompson III , son of the accomplished Hoyas coach John Thompson , is the current head coach . The Hoyas historically have been well regarded not only for their team success , but also for their ability to generate players that after graduation succeed both on the court , such as Patrick Ewing , and off , such as Paul Tagliabue and Henry Hyde . The team has reached the NCAA Tournament Final Four five times including the 1984 national championship , and has won the Big East Tournament seven times , and has also won or shared the Big East regular season title seven times . The women 's basketball also plays in the Big East Conference , and are coached by Terri Williams-Flournoy . The team was first formed in 1970 , and joined the Big East in 1983 . They play their home games on campus at McDonough Gymnasium . The women 's team so far has not seen the same success as the men 's , and have only been invited to the NCAA tournament three times , reaching the Sweet Sixteen in 1993 and 2011 , and the second round in 2010 . They have been invited to the Women 's National Invitation Tournament , five times , progressing furthest in 2009 by reaching the fourth round . = = = Rowing = = = Rowing at Georgetown has a distinguished history dating back to the founding of the Boat Club in 1876 . The team was however suspended from 1909 to 1920 due to lack of interest , and involvement in World War I. Georgetown added a men 's lightweight team in 1963 , a women 's team in 1975 , and a women 's lightweight team in 1996 . The men have won 5 national championships at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta , the most recent being the men 's varsity lightweight fours with coxswain on June 5 , 2016 . The first national championship win was in 1991 with the varsity heavyweight fours with coxswain . Under the guidance of coaches Tony Johnson and Steve Full , Georgetown competes as a member of the top leagues in American rowing , the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges and Eastern Association of Women 's Rowing Colleges . Georgetown 's four crew teams have seen success in recent years , including trips to the Henley Royal Regatta and entry into the Eastern Sprints for the men 's heavyweight and lightweight teams and second-in-the-nation finishes for both men 's and women 's lightweight teams . Many Georgetown oarsmen and -women have gone on to represent the United States on national and Olympic teams . The lightweight women 's team has earned bronze medals at Women 's Eastern Sprints in the Lightweight Women 's Varsity 8 + in 2013 and the Lightweight Women 's Varsity 4 + in 2015 . The LW8 + crew earning bronze in 2013 was later named Row2k Crew of the Week . The university rents space in Thompson Boat Center , though it has ongoing plans to build a new boathouse closer to campus . For land workouts , Georgetown rowers have access to the Rowing Training Center , a refurbished storeroom beneath the Leavey Center that was repurposed into an erg room in 2013 ( its underground , windowless location has inspired numerous nicknames such as the \" Thunder Dungeon \" ) . Notable Georgetown crew alumni include walk-on Mike Vespoli , the founder and chief executive officer of Vespoli USA , Inc. as well as actor Bradley Cooper . = = = Sailing = = = The sailing team competes in the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association ( MAISA ) of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association ( ICSA ) .

He is one of the six team members awarded as College Sailors of the Year on seven occasions , as Nevin Snow has taken the prize twice , in 2015 and 2016 . Campbell helped lead the team to the first of their 13 Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association National Championships since 2001 , and are the reigning national co-ed champions as of 2016 . During this time the team also won seven MAISA conference championships , known as the America Trophy . After the team 's 2013 national championship , they were invited to participate in the 2014 World University Match Racing Championships in Trentino , Italy , on Lago di Ledro , which they won 7 \u2013 1 , besting nineteen teams from fourteen countries . The Hoyas won the Leonard M. Fowle Trophy to the best overall collegiate team in 2006 . = = = Soccer = = = The men 's soccer team was organized in 1952 , and have made four NCAA Tournament appearances , in 1994 , 1997 , 2010 , and 2012 .

A men 's lacrosse team was first organized in 1951 , and entered Division 1 play in 1970 . The team played in the Eastern College Athletic Conference until the 2010 season , when the Big East Conference created a men 's league . The men 's team made the NCAA Tournament each season from 1996 \u2013 2007 , reaching the Final Four in 1999 . The women 's lacrosse team was formed in 1977 , and won the first 6 consecutive Big East titles from 2001 \u2013 2006 .

By the 1940s , Georgetown had one of the better college football teams in America , and played in the 1941 Orange Bowl , where they lost 14 \u2013 7 to Mississippi State . As the college game became more expensive after World War II , however , Georgetown 's program began to lose money rapidly . The Hoyas last successful season was 1949 , when they lost in the Sun Bowl against Texas Western . However the program was losing too much money , and on March 22 , 1951 , the university 's president canceled the football program . In 1964 , Georgetown allowed its students to start a football program as an exhibition-only club sport . Varsity football resumed in 1970 at what later became known as the Division III level . Today , Georgetown plays at the Division I Football Championship Subdivision , competing in the Patriot League and perennially plays against Ivy League schools . The Hoyas have also begun a cross-town rivalry with Howard University for a championship known as the D.C. Cup . \" Big Jim \" Ricca , an NFL defensive end and offensive lineman , graduated in 1949 and was the last Hoya to play in an NFL game . In 2007 , the Washington Redskins made Alex Buzbee a reserve player , becoming the first Georgetown player on an NFL team since Ricca retired in 1956 . The 2011 Georgetown Football team finished 8-3 , which was their first winning season since the 1999 campaign , giving them a second place in the conference . = = = Track and field = = = Georgetown has been nationally successful in both cross country and track and field .

                    "text": "Cary Grant = Cary Grant ( born Archibald Alexander Leach ; January 18 , 1904 \u2013 November 29 , 1986 ) was a British-American actor , known as one of classic Hollywood 's definitive leading men . He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s , and became known for his transatlantic accent , light-hearted approach to acting and comic timing , and debonair demeanor . He became an American citizen in 1942 . Born in Horfield , Bristol , Grant became attracted to theatre at a young age , and began performing with a troupe known as \" The Penders \" from the age of six . After attending Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol , he toured the country as a stage performer , and decided to stay in New York City after a performance there . He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s . He initially appeared in crime films or dramas such as Blonde Venus ( 1932 ) and She Done Him Wrong ( 1933 ) , but later gained renown for his appearances in romantic comedy and screwball comedy films such as The Awful Truth ( 1937 ) , Bringing Up Baby ( 1938 ) , His Girl Friday ( 1940 ) , The Philadelphia Story ( 1940 ) . Along with the later Arsenic and Old Lace ( 1944 ) and I Was a Male War Bride ( 1949 ) ; these films are frequently cited as among the all-time great comedy films . Having established himself as a major Hollywood star , he was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor , for Penny Serenade ( 1941 ) and None but the Lonely Heart ( 1944 ) . In the 1940s and 1950s , Grant forged a working relationship with the director Alfred Hitchcock , appearing in films such as Suspicion ( 1941 ) , Notorious ( 1946 ) , To Catch a Thief ( 1955 ) and North by Northwest ( 1959 ) . Hitchcock considered Grant to have been the only actor that he had ever loved . Towards the end of his film career , Grant was praised by critics as a romantic leading man , and received five Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nominations , including Indiscreet ( 1958 ) with Ingrid Bergman , That Touch of Mink ( 1962 ) with Doris Day , and Charade ( 1963 ) with Audrey Hepburn . He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal , as a handsome , suave actor who did not take himself too seriously , possessing the ability to play with his own dignity in comedies without sacrificing it entirely . His comic timing and delivery made Grant what Premiere considers to have been \" quite simply , the funniest actor cinema has ever produced \" . Grant was married five times ; three of his marriages were elopements with actresses \u2014 Virginia Cherrill ( 1934 \u2013 35 ) , Betsy Drake ( 1949 \u2013 62 ) and Dyan Cannon ( 1965 \u2013 68 ) . He has one daughter with Cannon , Jennifer Grant ( born 1966 ) . After his retirement from film acting in 1966 , Grant pursued numerous business interests , representing cosmetics firm Faberg\u00e9 , and sitting on the board of MGM and others . He was presented with an Honorary Oscar by his friend Frank Sinatra at the 42nd Academy Awards in 1970 , and in 1981 , he was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors . In 1999 , the American Film Institute named Grant the second greatest male star of Golden Age Hollywood cinema , after Humphrey Bogart . = = Early life and education = = Grant was born Archibald Leach on January 18 , 1904 at 15 Hughenden Road in the northern Bristol suburb of Horfield . He was the second child of Elias James Leach ( 1873 \u2013 1935 ) and Elsie Maria Leach ( n\u00e9e Kingdon ; 1877 \u2013 1973 ) . Elias , the son of a potter , worked as a tailor 's presser at a clothes factory , while Elsie , who was from a family of shipwrights , worked as a seamstress . Grant 's elder brother , John William Elias Leach ( 1899 \u2013 1900 ) , died of tuberculous meningitis . Grant considered himself to have been partly Jewish . He had an unhappy upbringing ; his father was an alcoholic , and his mother suffered from clinical depression . Wanting the best for her son , Elsie taught Grant song and dance when he was four , and was keen on him having piano lessons . She would occasionally take him to the cinema where he enjoyed the performances of Charlie Chaplin , Chester Conklin , Fatty Arbuckle , Ford Sterling , Mack Swain and Broncho Billy Anderson . Grant entered education when he was four-and-a-half and was sent to the Bishop Road Primary School , Bristol . Grant 's biographer Graham McCann mentions that Maureen Donaldson , a lover of Grant in the 1970s , claimed in her book that his mother \" did not know how to give affection and did not know how to receive it either . \" Another biographer , Geoffrey Wansell , notes that Elsie blamed herself bitterly for the death of Grant 's older brother John , and never recovered from it . Grant later acknowledged that his negative experiences with his fiercely independent mother affected his relationships with women later in life . She frowned on alcohol and tobacco , and would reduce pocket money for minor mishaps . Grant later attributed her behavior towards him as down to her being overprotective , fearing that she would lose him as she did John . Grant 's father later placed his mother in Glenside Hospital ( a mental institution ) and told the 9-year-old that she had gone away on a \" long holiday \" , later declaring that she had died . Grant grew up resenting his mother , particularly after she left the family . After Elsie was gone , Grant and his father moved into the home of his grandmother in Bristol . When Grant was 10 , his father remarried and started a new family that did not include his son . Grant did not learn that his mother was still alive until he was 31 , when his father confessed to the lie , shortly before his own death . Grant made arrangements for his mother to leave the institution in June 1935 , shortly after he learned of her whereabouts . He visited her during a break to England in October 1938 , after filming for Gunga Din was completed . Due to alienation from his parents , he found it difficult to socialize and had a nervous disposition . He enjoyed the theatre , particularly pantomimes at Christmas which he would attend with his father . Grant befriended a troupe of acrobatic dancers , known as \" The Penders \" or the \" Bob Pender Stage Troupe \" . He subsequently trained as a stilt walker and began touring with them . During a two-week stint at the Wintergarten theatre in Berlin circa 1914 he was noticed by Jesse Lasky , who was a Broadway producer at the time . In 1915 , Grant won a scholarship to attend Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol , although his father could barely afford to pay for the uniform . With his good looks and acrobatic talents Grant became a popular figure among both girls and boys . Though he was able at most academic subjects He excelled at sports , particularly fives , and developed a reputation for mischief ; he frequently refused to do his homework . A former classmate referred to him as a \" scruffy little boy \" , while an old teacher remembered \" the naughty little boy who was always making a noise in the back row and would never do his homework \" . His evenings were spent working backstage in Bristol theatres , and in 1917 , at the age of 13 , he was responsible for the lighting for the magician David Devant at the Hippodrome . Grant began hanging around backstage at the theatre at every opportunity . In the summer he volunteered for work as a messenger boy and guide at the military docks in Southampton , to escape the unhappiness of his home life . The time spent at Southampton strengthened his desire to travel ; he was eager to leave Bristol and tried to sign on as a ship 's cabin boy , but learned he was too young . On March 13 , 1918 , Grant was expelled from Fairfield . Several explanations were given , including being discovered in the girls ' lavatory , and assisting two other classmates with theft in the nearby town of Almondsbury . Wansell claims that Grant had set out to intentionally get himself expelled from school to pursue a career in entertainment with the troupe . Grant rejoined Pender 's troupe three days after being expelled from Fairfield . Elias now had a better paying job in Southampton ; Grant 's expulsion from the school brought local authorities to his door with questions about why his son was living in Bristol and not with his father in Southampton . Upon learning that his son was once again with the Pender troupe , Elias co-signed a three-year contract between his son and Pender . The contract stipulated Grant 's weekly salary along with room and board , as well as dancing lessons and other training for his profession until the age of 18 . There was also a provision in the contract for salary rises based on job performance . = = Vaudeville and performing career = = Without school to attend , Grant rejoined the Pender Troupe , and accepted a salary of 10 shillings a week from Pender . The group began touring the county , and Grant developed the ability in pantomime to broaden his physical acting skills . On July 21 , 1920 , at the age 16 , Grant travelled with the group on the RMS Olympic to conduct a tour of the United States , arriving a week later . Biographer Richard Schickel claims that Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were aboard the same ship , returning from their honeymoon , and that Grant played shuffleboard with him . He was so impressed with Fairbanks that the actor became an important role model . After arriving in New York , the group performed at the New York Hippodrome \u2014 the largest theatre in the world at the time with a capacity of 5,697 \u2014 for nine months , putting on twelve shows a week ; their production of Good Times was successful . Grant became a part of the vaudeville circuit and began touring . After performing in places such as St. Louis , Missouri , Cleveland and Milwaukee , he made the decision to stay in the US with several of the other members , while the rest of the troupe returned to Britain . He remembered becoming fond of the performances of the Marx Brothers during this period and Zeppo Marx was an early role model for him . In July 1922 , Grant performed in a group with seven others , the \" Knockabout Comedians \" , at the Palace Theatre on Broadway . He formed a group that summer , \" The Walking Stanleys \" , with several of the former members of the Pender Troupe , and starred in a variety show named \" Better Times \" at the Hippodrome towards the end of the year . After meeting George C. Tilyou , the owner of the Steeplechase Park racecourse on Coney Island at a party , Grant was hired to appear there on stilts and attracted large crowds , wearing a bright-great coat and a sandwich board which advertised the race-track . Grant spent the next couple of years touring the United States with \" The Walking Stanleys \" . He visited Los Angeles for the first time in 1924 , which left a lasting impression upon him . After the group split up he returned to New York , where he began living and performing at the National Vaudeville Artists Club on West 46th Street , juggling , performing acrobatics and comic sketches and having a short spell as a unicycle rider known as \" Rubber Legs \" . The experience was a particularly demanding one , but gave Grant the opportunity to improve his comic technique and develop skills which would benefit him later in Hollywood . Grant became a leading man alongside Jean Dalrymple , and decided to form the \" Jack Janis Company \" , which began touring vaudeville . He was sometimes mistaken for an Australian during this period , and was nicknamed \" Kangaroo \" or \" Boomerang \" . Grant 's accent seems to have changed as a result of moving to London with the Pender troupe and working in many music halls in the UK and the US , eventually becoming what some term a transatlantic or mid-Atlantic accent . In 1927 he was cast as an Australian in Reggie Hammerstein 's musical , Golden Dawn , for which he earned $ 75 a week . Although the show was not well received , it lasted for 184 performances , and several critics started to notice the \" pleasant new juvenile \" or \" competent young newcomer \" . The following year he joined the William Morris Agency and was offered another juvenile part by Hammerstein , in his play Polly , an unsuccessful production . One critic wrote that Grant \" has a strong masculine manner , but unfortunately fails to bring out the beauty of the score . \" Wansell notes that the pressure of a failing production began to make him fret , and he was eventually dropped from the run after six weeks of poor reviews . Despite the set back , Hammerstein 's rival Florenz Ziegfeld made an attempt to buy Grant 's contract , but Hammerstein sold it to the Shubert Brothers instead . J. J. Shubert cast him in a small role as a Spaniard opposite Jeanette MacDonald in the French risqu\u00e9 comedy production of Boom-Boom at the Casino Theatre on Broadway , which premiered on January 28 , 1929 . MacDonald later admitted that he was \" absolutely terrible in the role \" , but exhibited a charm which endeared him to people and effectively saved the show from failure . The play ran for 72 shows , and Grant earned $ 350 a week before moving to Detroit , then Chicago . To console himself , Grant bought a 1927 Packard sport phaeton . He visited his half-brother , Eric , in England , and upon returning to New York later in the year , he played the role of Max Grunewald in a Shubert production of A Wonderful Night . It premiered at the Majestic Theatre on October 31 , 1929 , two days after the Wall Street Crash , and lasted for 125 shows until February 1930 . The play received mixed reviews ; one critic criticized his acting , likening it to a \" mixture of John Barrymore and cockney \" , while another announced that he had brought a \" breath of elfin Broadway \" to the role . Though he began to gain recognition , Grant still found it difficult forming relationships with women , remarking that \" In all those years in the theatre , on the road and in New York , surrounded by all sorts of attractive girls , I never seemed able to fully communicate with them . \" In 1930 , Grant toured for nine months in a production of the musical , The Street Singer . After the production came to end in the spring of 1931 , the Shuberts invited him to spend the summer performing on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis , Missouri ; he appeared in twelve different productions , putting on 87 shows . He received praise from local newspapers for these performances , gaining a reputation as a romantic leading man . Significant influences on his acting in this period were Sir Gerald du Maurier , A. E. Matthews , Jack Buchanan and Ronald Squire . He later admitted that he was drawn to acting because of a \" great need to be liked and admired \" . Grant was eventually fired by the Shuberts at the end of the summer season when he refused to accept a pay cut because of financial difficulties caused by the Depression . His unemployment was short lived ; impresario William B. Friedlander offered him the lead romantic part in his new musical , Nikki , in which Grant starred opposite Fay Wray as a soldier in post-World War I France . The production opened on September 29 , 1931 in New York , but was stopped after just 39 performances due to the effects of the Depression . = = Film career = = = = = Early roles ( 1932 \u2013 36 ) = = = Grant 's role in Nikki was praised by Ed Sullivan of The New York Daily News , who noted that the \" young lad from England \" had \" a big future in the movies \" . The review led to another screen test by Paramount Publix , resulting in appearance as a sailor in Singapore Sue ( 1932 ) , a ten-minute short film by Casey Robinson . Grant delivers his lines \" without any conviction \" according to McCann . Through Robinson , Grant met with Jesse L. Lasky and B. P. Schulberg , the co-founder and general manager of Paramount Pictures respectively . After a successful screen-test directed by Marion Gering . Schulberg signed a contract with the 27-year-old Grant on December 7 , 1931 for five years , at a starting salary of $ 450 a week . Schulberg demanded that he change his name to \" something that sounded more all-American like Gary Cooper \" , and they eventually agreed on Cary Grant . Cary Grant set out to establish himself as what McCann calls the \" epitome of masculine glamour \" , and made Douglas Fairbanks his first role model . McCann notes that Grant 's career in Hollywood immediately took off because he exhibited a \" genuine charm \" , which made him stand out among the other good looking actors at the time , making it \" remarkably easy to find people who were willing to support his embryonic career \" . He made his feature film debut with the Frank Tuttle-directed comedy This is the Night ( 1932 ) , playing an Olympic javelin thrower opposite Thelma Todd and Lili Damita . Grant disliked his role and threatened to leave Hollywood , but to his surprise a critic from Variety praised his performance , and thought that he looked like a \" potential femme rave \" . In 1932 Grant played a wealthy playboy opposite Marlene Dietrich in Blonde Venus , directed by Josef von Sternberg . Grant 's role is described by William Rothman as projecting the \" distinctive kind of nonmacho masculinity that was to enable him to incarnate a man capable of being a romantic hero \" . Grant found that he conflicted with the director during the filming and the two often argued in German . He played a suave playboy type in a number of films : Merrily We Go to Hell opposite Frederic March and Sylvia Sidney , Devil and the Deep alongside Gary Cooper , Charles Laughton and Tallulah Bankhead , Hot Saturday opposite Nancy Carroll and Randolph Scott , and Madame Butterfly with Sidney . According to biographer Marc Eliot , while these films did not make Grant a star , they did well enough to establish him as one of Hollywood 's \" new crop of fast-rising actors \" . In 1933 , Grant gained attention for appearing in the pre-Code films She Done Him Wrong and I 'm No Angel opposite Mae West . West would later claim that she had discovered Cary Grant . Pauline Kael noted that Grant did not appear confident in his role as a Salvation Army director in She Done Him Wrong , which made it all the more charming . The film was a box office hit , earning more than $ 2 million in the United States , and has since won much acclaim . For I 'm No Angel , Grant 's salary was increased from $ 450 to $ 750 a week . The film was even more successful than She Done Him Wrong , and saved Paramount from bankruptcy ; Vermilye cites it as one of the best comedy films of the 1930s . After a string of financially unsuccessful films , which included roles as a president of a company who is sued for knocking down a boy in an accident in Born to Be Bad ( 1934 ) for 20th Century Fox , a cosmetic surgeon in Kiss and Make-Up ( 1934 ) , and a blinded pilot opposite Myrna Loy in Wings in the Dark ( 1935 ) , successive poor box office takings and press reports of his fledging marriage to Cherrill , led Paramount to form the conclusion that Grant was now expendable . Grant 's prospects picked up in the latter half of 1935 when was loaned to RKO Pictures . Producer Pandro Berman agreed to take him on in the face of failure because \" I 'd seen him do things which were excellent , and [ Katharine ] Hepburn wanted him too . \" For his first venture with RKO , playing a raffish cockney swindler in George Cukor 's Sylvia Scarlett ( 1935 ) , he began the first of four collaborations with Hepburn . Though a commercial failure , his dominating performance was praised by critics , and Grant always considered the film to have been the breakthrough for his career . When his contract with Paramount ended in 1936 with the release of Wedding Present , Grant decided not to renew it and wished to work freelance . Grant claimed to be the first freelance actor in Hollywood and the lack of central contract helped increase his salary to $ 300,000 per picture . His first venture as a freelance actor was The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss ( 1936 ) , which was shot in England . The film was a box office bomb and prompted Grant to reconsider his decision . Critical and commercial success with Suzy later that year in which he played a French airman opposite Jean Harlow and Franchot Tone , led to him signing joint contracts with RKO and Columbia Pictures , enabling him to choose the stories that he felt suited his acting style . His Columbia contract was a four-film deal over two years , guaranteeing him $ 50,000 each for the first two and $ 75,000 each for the others . = = = Hollywood stardom and Oscar recognition ( 1937 \u2013 44 ) = = = In 1937 , Grant began the first film under his contract with Columbia Pictures , When You 're in Love , portraying a wealthy American artist who eventually woos a famous opera singer ( Grace Moore ) . His performance received positive feedback from critics , with Mae Tinee of The Chicago Daily Tribune describing it as the \" best thing he 's done in a long time \" . After a commercial failure in his first RKO venture The Toast of New York , Grant was loaned to Hal Roach 's studio for Topper , a screwball comedy film distributed by MGM , which became his first major comedy success . Grant played one half of a wealthy , freewheeling married couple with Constance Bennett , who wreak havoc on the world as ghosts after dying in a car accident . Topper became one of the most popular movies of the year , with a critic from Variety noting that both Grant and Bennett \" do their assignments with great skill \" . Vermilye described the film 's success as \" a logical springboard \" for Grant to star in The Awful Truth that year , his first film made with Irene Dunne and Ralph Bellamy . Though McCarey reportedly disliked Grant , who had mocked the director by enacting his mannerisms in the film , he recognized Grant 's comic talents and encouraged him to improvize his lines and draw upon his skills developed in vaudeville . The film was a critical and commercial success and made Grant a top Hollywood star , establishing a screen persona for him as a sophisticated light comedy leading man in screwball comedies . The Awful Truth began what film critic Benjamin Schwarz of The Atlantic later called \" the most spectacular run ever for an actor in American pictures \" for Grant . In 1938 he starred opposite Katharine Hepburn in the screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby , featuring a leopard and frequent bickering and verbal jousting between Grant and Hepburn . He was initially uncertain how to play his character , but was told by director Howard Hawks to think of Harold Lloyd . Grant was given more leeway in the comic scenes , the editing of the film and in educating Hepburn in the art of comedy . Despite losing over $ 350,000 for RKO , the film earned rave reviews from critics . He again appeared with Hepburn in the romantic comedy Holiday later that year , which did not fare well commercially , to the point that Hepburn was considered to be \" box office poison \" at the time . Despite a series of commercial failures , Grant was now more popular than ever and in high demand . According to Vermilye , in 1939 Grant played roles that were more dramatic , albeit with comical undertones . He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film Gunga Din , set at a military station in India . Roles as a pilot opposite Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth in Hawks 's Only Angels Have Wings , and a wealthy landowner alongside Carole Lombard in In Name Only followed . In 1940 , Grant played a callous newspaper editor who learns that his ex-wife and former journalist , played by Rosalind Russell , is to marry an insurance officer in the comedy His Girl Friday , which was praised for its strong chemistry and \" great verbal athleticism \" between Grant and Russell . Grant reunited with Irene Dunne in My Favorite Wife , a \" first rate comedy \" according to Life magazine , which became RKO 's second biggest picture of the year , with profits of $ 505,000 . After playing a Virginian backwoodsman in the American Revolution-set The Howards of Virginia , which McCann considers to have been Grant 's worst film and performance , his last film of the year was in the critically lauded romantic comedy The Philadelphia Story , in which he played the ex-husband of Hepburn 's character . Grant felt his performance was so strong that he was bitterly disappointed not to have received an Oscar nomination , and joked \" I 'd have to blacken my teeth first before the Academy will take me seriously \" . The following year Grant was considered for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Penny Serenade \u2014 his first nomination from the academy . Wansell claims that Grant found the film to be an emotional experience , because he and wife-to-be Barbara Hutton had started to discuss having their own children . Later that year he appeared in the romantic psychological thriller Suspicion , the first of Grant 's four collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock . Grant did not warm to co-star Joan Fontaine , finding her to be temperamental and unprofessional . Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times considered that Grant was \" provokingly irresponsible , boyishly gay and also oddly mysterious , as the role properly demands \" . Hitchcock later stated that he thought the ending of the film in which Grant is sent to jail instead of committing suicide \" a complete mistake because of making that story with Cary Grant . Unless you have a cynical ending it makes the story too simple \" . Geoff Andrew of Time Out believes Suspicion served as \" a supreme example of Grant 's ability to be simultaneously charming and sinister \" . In 1942 Grant participated in a three-week tour of the United States as part of a group to help the war effort and was photographed visiting wounded marines in hospital . He appeared in several routines of his own during these shows and often played the straight-man opposite Bert Lahr . In May 1944 , the ten-minute propaganda short Road to Victory was released , in which he appeared alongside Bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra and Charles Ruggles . On film , in 1942 Grant played Leopold Dilg , a convict on the run in The Talk of the Town , who escapes after being wrongly convicted of arson and murder . He hides in a house with characters played by Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman , and gradually plots to secure his freedom . Crowther praised the script , and noted that Grant played Dilg with a \" casualness which is slightly disturbing \" . After a role as a foreign correspondent opposite Ginger Rogers and Walter Slezak in the off-beat comedy Once Upon a Honeymoon , in which he was praised for his scenes with Rogers , the following year he appeared in Mr. Lucky , playing a gambler in a casino aboard a ship . The commercially successful submarine war film Destination Tokyo ( 1943 ) was shot in just six weeks in the September and October , which left him exhausted ; the reviewer from Newsweek thought it was one of the finest performances of his career . In 1944 , Grant starred alongside Priscilla Lane , Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre , in Frank Capra 's dark comedy Arsenic and Old Lace , playing the manic Mortimer Brewster , who belongs to a bizarre family which includes two murderous aunts and an uncle claiming to be President Roosevelt . Grant took up the role after it was originally offered to Bob Hope , who turned it down owing to schedule conflicts . Grant found the macabre subject matter of the film difficult to contend with and believed that it was the worst performance of his career . That year he received his second Oscar nomination for a role , opposite Ethel Barrymore and Barry Fitzgerald in the Clifford Odets-directed film None but the Lonely Heart , set in London during the Depression . Late in the year he featured in the CBS Radio series Suspense , playing a tormented character who hysterically discovers that his amnesia has affected masculine order in society in \" The Black Curtain \" . = = = Post-War success and slump ( 1946 \u2013 54 ) = = = After making a brief cameo appearance opposite Claudette Colbert in Without Reservations , Grant portrayed Cole Porter in the musical Night and Day ( 1946 ) . The production proved to be problematic , with scenes often requiring multiple takes , frustrating the cast and crew . Grant next appeared with Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains in the Hitchcock-directed film Notorious ( 1946 ) , playing a government agent who recruits the American daughter of a convicted Nazi spy ( Bergman ) to infiltrate a Nazi organization in Brazil after World War II . During the course of the film Grant and Bergman 's characters fall in love and share one of the longest kisses in film history at around two-and-a-half minutes . Wansell notes how Grant 's performance \" underlined how far his unique qualities as a screen actor had matured in the years since The Awful Truth \" . In 1947 , Grant played an artist who becomes involved in a court case when charged with assault in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer , opposite Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple . The film was praised by the critics , who admired the picture 's slapstick qualities and chemistry between Grant and Loy ; it became one of the biggest-selling films at the box office that year . Later that year he starred opposite David Niven and Loretta Young in the comedy The Bishop 's Wife , playing an angel who is sent down from heaven to straighten out the relationship between the bishop ( Niven ) and his wife ( Loretta Young ) . The film was a major commercial and critical success , and was nominated for five Academy Awards . Life magazine called it \" intelligently written and competently acted \" . The following year , Grant played neurotic Jim Blandings , the title-sake in the comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House , again with Loy . Though the film picture lost a lot of money for RKO , Philip T. Hartung of Commonweal thought that Grant 's role as the \" frustrated advertising man \" was one of his best screen portrayals . In Every Girl Should Be Married , an \" airy comedy \" , he appeared with Betsy Drake and Franchot Tone , playing a bachelor who is trapped into marriage by Drake 's conniving character . He finished the year as the fourth most popular film star at the box office . In 1949 Grant starred alongside Ann Sheridan in the comedy I Was a Male War Bride in which he appeared in scenes dressed as a woman , wearing a skirt and a wig . During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight , affecting the way he looked in the picture . The film proved to be successful , becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $ 4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks 's screwball comedies of the late 1930s . By this point he was one of the highest paid Hollywood stars , commanding $ 300,000 per picture . The early 1950s marked the beginning of a slump in Grant 's career . His roles as a top brain surgeon who is caught in the middle of a bitter revolution in a Latin American country in Crisis , and as a medical-school professor and orchestra conductor opposite Jeanne Crain in People Will Talk. were poorly received . Grant had become tired of being Cary Grant after twenty years , being successful , wealthy and popular , and remarked : \" To play yourself , your true self , is the hardest thing in the world \" . In 1952 , Grant starred in the comedy Room for One More , playing an engineer husband who with his wife ( Betsy Drake ) adopt two children from an orphanage . He reunited with Howard Hawks to film the off-beat comedy Monkey Business , co-starring with Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe . Though the critic from Motion Picture Herald wrote gushingly that Grant had given a career 's best with an \" extraordinary agile and performance \" , which was matched by Rogers , it received a mixed reception overall . Grant had hoped that starring opposite Deborah Kerr in the romantic comedy Dream Wife would salvage his career , but it was a critical and financial failure upon release in July 1953 . Though he was considered for the leading part in A Star is Born , Grant believed that his film career was over , and briefly left the industry . = = = A romantic leading man and final roles ( 1955 \u2013 66 ) = = = In 1955 Grant agreed to star opposite Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief , playing a retired jewel thief nicknamed \" The Cat \" , living in the French Riviera . Grant and Kelly worked well together during the production , and marked one of the most enjoyable experiences of Grant 's career . He found Hitchock and Kelly to be very professional , and later stated that Kelly was \" possibly the finest actress I 've ever worked with \" . Grant was one of the first actors to go independent by not renewing his studio contract , effectively leaving the studio system , which almost completely controlled all aspects of an actor 's life . He decided which films he was going to appear in , often had personal choice of directors and co-stars , and at times negotiated a share of the gross revenue , something uncommon at the time . Grant received more than $ 700,000 for his 10 % of the gross of the successful To Catch a Thief , while Hitchcock received less than $ 50,000 for directing and producing it . Though critical reception to the overall film was mixed , Grant received high praise for his performance , with critics commenting on his suave , handsome appearance in the film . In 1957 Grant starred opposite Kerr in the romance An Affair to Remember , playing an international playboy who becomes the object of her affections . Schickel sees the film as one of the definitive romantic pictures of the period , but remarks that Grant was not entirely successful in trying to supersede the film 's \" gushing sentimentality \" . That year , Grant also appeared opposite Sophia Loren in The Pride and the Passion . He had expressed an interest in playing William Holden 's character in The Bridge on the River Kwai at the time , but found that it was not possible because of his commitment to The Pride and the Passion . The film was shot on location in Spain and was problematic , with co-star Frank Sinatra irritating his colleagues and leaving the production after just a few weeks . Grant 's attempts to woo Loren during the production proved fruitless , which led to him expressing anger when Paramount cast her opposite him in Houseboat ( 1958 ) as part of her contract . The sexual tension between the two was so great during the making of Houseboat that the producers found it almost impossible to make . Later in 1958 , Grant starred opposite Bergman in the romantic comedy Indiscreet , playing a successful financier who has an affair with a famous actress ( Bergman ) while pretending to be a married man . During the filming he formed a closer friendship and gained new respect for her as an actress . Schickel stated that he thought the film was possibly the finest romantic comedy film of the era , and that Grant himself had professed that it was one of his personal favorites . Grant received his first of five Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nominations for his performance and finished the year as the most popular film star at the box office . In 1959 Grant starred in the Hitchcock-directed film North by Northwest , playing an advertising executive who becomes embroiled in a case of mistaken identity . Like Indiscreet , it was warmly received by the critics and was a major commercial success , and is now often listed as one of the greatest films of all time . Weiler , writing in The New York Times , praised Grant 's performance , remarking that the actor \" was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam \" and handled the role \" with professional aplomb and grace \" . Grant wore one of his most iconic suits in the film which became very popular , a fourteen-gauge , mid-gray , worsted wool one custom-made on Savile Row . Grant finished the year playing a U. S. Navy Rear Admiral aboard a submarine opposite Tony Curtis in the comedy Operation Petticoat . The reviewer from Daily Variety saw Grant 's comic portrayal as a classic example of how to attract the laughter of the audience without lines , remarking that \" In this film , most of the gags play off him . It is his reaction , blank , startled , etc . , always underplayed , that creates or releases the humor \" . The film was major box office success , and in 1973 Deschner ranked the film as the highest earning film of Grant 's career at the US box office , with takings of $ 9.5 million . In 1960 Grant appeared opposite Robert Mitchum , Jean Simmons and Deborah Kerr in The Grass Is Greener , which was shot in England at Osterley Park and Shepperton Studios . McCann notes that Grant took great relish in \" mocking his aristocratic character 's over-refined tastes and mannerisms \" , though the film was panned and was seen as his worst since Dream Wife . In 1962 , Grant starred in the romantic comedy That Touch of Mink , playing suave , wealthy businessman Philip Shayne romantically involved with an office worker , played by Doris Day . He invites her to his apartment in Bermuda , but her guilty conscience begins to take hold . The picture was praised by critics , and it received three Academy Award nominations , and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Picture , in addition to another Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination . Deschner ranked the film has the second highest grossing of Grant 's career . Producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman originally sought Grant for the role of James Bond in Dr. No ( 1962 ) but discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film ; therefore , the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a franchise . In 1963 , Grant appeared in his last typically suave , romantic role opposite Audrey Hepburn in Charade . Grant found the experience of working with Hepburn \" wonderful \" and believed that their close relationship was clear on camera , though according to Hepburn , he was particularly worried during the filming that he would be criticized for being far too old for her and seen as a \" cradle snatcher \" . Author Chris Barsanti writes : \" It 's the film 's canny flirtatiousness that makes it such ingenious entertainment . Grant and Hepburn play off each other like the pros that they are \" . The film , well received by the critics , is often called \" the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made \" . In 1964 , Grant changed from his typically suave , distinguished screen persona to play a grizzled beachcomber Walter Eckland who is hired by a Commander ( Trevor Howard ) to serve as a lookout on Matalava Island for invading Japanese planes in the World War II romantic comedy , Father Goose . The film was a major commercial success , and upon its release at Radio City at Christmas 1964 it took over $ 210,000 at the box-office in the first week , breaking the record set by Charade the previous year . Grant 's final film , Walk , Don 't Run ( 1966 ) , a comedy co-starring Jim Hutton and Samantha Eggar , was shot on location in Tokyo , and is set amid the backdrop of the housing shortage of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics . Newsweek concluded : \" Though Grant 's personal presence is indispensable , the character he plays is almost wholly superfluous . Perhaps the inference to be taken is that a man in his 50s or 60s has no place in romantic comedy except as a catalyst . If so , the chemistry is wrong for everyone \" . Hitchcock had asked Grant to star in Torn Curtain that year only to learn that he had decided to retire . = = Later years = = Grant retired from the screen at 62 , when his daughter Jennifer was born , to focus on bringing her up and to provide a sense of permanency and stability in her life . He had become increasingly disillusioned with cinema in the 1960s , rarely finding a script that he approved of . He remarked : \" I could have gone on acting and playing a grandfather or a bum , but I discovered more important things in life \" . Grant knew after he had made Charade that the \" Golden Age \" of Hollywood was now over . He expressed little interest in making a career comeback , and continued to respond to invites or mention of it with \" fat chance \" . He did , however , briefly appear in the video documentary for Elvis 's 1970 Las Vegas concert Elvis : That 's the Way It Is , in the audience . When he was gifted with the negatives from a number of his films in the 1970s , Grant sold them to television for a sum of over two million dollars in 1975 . Morecambe and Stirling argue that Grant 's abstinence from film after 1966 was \" not the actions of a man who had irrevocably turned his back on the film industry , but one who was caught between a decision made and the temptation to a eat a bit of humble pie and re-announce himself to the cinema-going public \" . In the 1970s , MGM were keen on remaking Grand Hotel ( 1932 ) , and hoped to lure Grant into coming out of retirement to star . Hitchcock had long wanted to make a film based on the idea of Hamlet , with Grant in the lead role . Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to try to get him to play the role of Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait ( 1978 ) , which eventually went to James Mason . Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class ( 1973 ) , The Verdict ( 1982 ) and a film adaptation of William Goldman 's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade . In the late 1970s and early 1980s Grant became troubled by the deaths of so many of his close friends , including Howard Hughes in 1976 , Howard Hawks in 1977 , Lord Mountbatten and Barbara Hutton in 1979 , Alfred Hitchcock in 1980 , Grace Kelly and Ingrid Bergman in 1982 and David Niven in 1983 . At the funeral of Mountbatten he was quoted as remarking to a friend : \" I 'm absolutely pooped , and I 'm so goddamned old ... I 'm going to quit all next year . I 'm going to lie in bed ... I shall just close all doors , turn off the telephone , and enjoy my life \" . Kelly 's death was the hardest hitting on Grant , as the death was unexpected , and the two remained close friends after filming To Catch a Thief . Grant visited Monaco three or four times each year during his retirement , and showed his support for Kelly by joining the board of the Princess Grace Foundation . In 1980 , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art put on a two-month retrospective of over 40 of Grant 's films . In 1982 he was honored with the \" Man of the Year \" award by the New York Friars Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . He turned 80 in 1984 ; Peter Bogdanovich noticed that a \" serenity \" had come over the actor . Grant was in good health until suffering a mild stroke in October that year . In the last few years of his life , he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man show , A Conversation with Cary Grant , in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions . He made some 36 public appearances in his last four years , from New Jersey to Texas , and found his audiences changed from elderly film buffs to enthusiastic college students discovering his films for the first time . Grant admitted that he thought the appearances were \" ego-fodder \" , remarking that \" I know who I am inside and outside , but it 's nice to have the outside , at least , substantiated \" . = = Business interests = = Stirling refers to Grant as \" one of the shrewdest businessmen ever to operate in Hollywood \" . His long-term friendship with Howard Hughes from the 1930s onward saw him invited into the most glamorous circles in Hollywood and their lavish parties . Biographers Morecambe and Stirling state that Hughes played a major role in the development of Grant 's business interests , so that by 1939 , he was \" already an astute operator with various commercial interests \" . Scott also played a role , encouraging Grant to invest his money in shares , making him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s . In the 1940s , Grant and Barbara Hutton invested heavily in real estate development in Acapulco at a time when it was little more than a fishing village , and teamed with Richard Widmark , Roy Rogers , and Red Skelton to buy a hotel there . Behind his business interests was a particularly intelligent mind , to the point that his friend David Niven once said : \" Before computers went into general release , Cary had one in his brain \" . Film critic David Thomson believes that Grant 's intelligence came across on screen , and stated that \" no one else looked so good and so intelligent at the same time \" . After Grant retired from the screen , he became more active in business . He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberg\u00e9 . This position was not honorary , as some had assumed ; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them . His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career , a salary of a reported $ 15,000 a year . Such was Grant 's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $ 50 million in 1968 , a growth of nearly 80 % since the inaugural year in 1964 . The position also permitted use of a private plane , which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother , Dyan Cannon , was working . In 1975 , Grant was an appointed director of MGM . In 1980 , he sat on the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company . He played an active role in the promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973 and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s . When Allen Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he noticed how tired Grant looked , and his \" slightly melancholic air \" . Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park , the Academy of Magical Arts ( The Magic Castle , Hollywood , California ) , and Western Airlines ( acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987 ) . = = Personal life = = One of the wealthiest stars in Hollywood , Grant owned houses in Beverly Hills , Malibu , and Palm Springs . Immaculate in his personal grooming , Edith Head , the renowned Hollywood costume designer , appreciated his \" meticulous \" attention to detail and considered him to have had the greatest fashion sense of any actor she had worked with . McCann attests his \" almost obsessive maintenance \" with tanning , which deepened the older he got , to Douglas Fairbanks , who also had a major influence on his refined sense of dress . McCann notes that because Grant came from a working-class background and was not well educated , he made a particular effort over the course of his career to mix with high society and absorb their knowledge , manners and etiquette to compensate and cover it up . His image was meticulously crafted from the early days in Hollywood , where he would frequently sunbathe and avoid being photographed smoking , despite smoking two packs a day at the time . Grant quit smoking in the early 1950s through hypnotherapy . He remained health conscious , staying very trim and athletic even into his late career , though Grant admitted he \" never crook [ ed ] a finger to keep fit \" . He confessed that he did \" everything in moderation . Except making love \" . Grant 's daughter Jennifer stated that her father made hundreds of friends from all walks of life , and that their house was frequently visited by the likes of Frank and Barbara Sinatra , Quincy Jones , Gregory Peck and his wife Veronique , Johnny Carson and his wife , Kirk Kerkorian and Merv Griffin . She said that Grant and Sinatra were the closest of friends and that both men were remarkably similar in that they both shared a similar radiance and \" indefinable incandescence of charm \" , and were eternally \" high on life \" . While raising Jennifer , Grant archived artefacts of her childhood and adolescence in a bank-quality , room-sized vault he had installed in the house . Jennifer attributed this meticulous collection to the fact that artefacts of his own childhood had been destroyed during the Luftwaffe 's bombing of Bristol in the Second World War ( an event that also claimed the lives of his uncle , aunt , cousin , and the cousin 's husband and grandson ) , and he may have wanted to prevent her from experiencing a similar loss . Grant lived with actor Randolph Scott off and on for 12 years , which several authors have claimed was a gay or bisexual relationship . The two had first met early on in Grant 's career in 1932 at the Paramount studio when Scott was filming Sky Bride at the same time as Grant was shooting Sinners in the Sun , and moved in together soon afterwards . Scott 's biographer Robert Nott states that there is no evidence that Grant and Scott were homosexual , and blames rumors on material written about them in other books , which was assumed true by historians . Grant 's daughter , Jennifer , denied the claims . When Chevy Chase joked on television in 1980 that Grant was a \" homo . What a gal ! \" , Grant sued him for slander , and Chase was forced to retract his words . Grant became a fan of Morecambe and Wise in the 1960s , and remained friends with Eric Morecambe until his death in 1984 . Grant began experimenting with the drug LSD in the late 1950s , before it become commercially popular . His wife , Betsy Drake , displayed a keen interest in psychotherapy , and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis . Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s , with Grant optimistic that the treatment could make him feel better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships . He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years . For a long time , Grant viewed the drug positively , and stated that it was the solution after many years of \" searching for his peace of mind \" , and that for first time in his life he was \" truly , deeply and honestly happy \" . Cannon claimed during a court hearing , in which she claimed he was an \" apostle of LSD \" , that he was still taking the drug in 1967 as part of a remedy to save their relationship . Grant later admitted that \" taking LSD was an utterly foolish thing to do but I was a self-opinionated boor , hiding all kinds of layers and defences , hypocrisy and vanity . I had to get rid of them and wipe the slate clean \" . = = = Relationships = = = Grant was married five times . He wed Virginia Cherrill on February 9 , 1934 at Caxton Hall registry office in London . She divorced him on March 26 , 1935 , following charges that Grant had hit her . The two were involved in a bitter divorce case which was widely reported in the press , with Cherrill demanding $ 1000 a week from her husband in benefits from his Paramount earnings . After the demise of the marriage , he dated actress Phyllis Brooks from 1937 . They had considered marriage , and vacationed together in Europe in the summer of 1939 , visiting the Roman villa of Dorothy di Frasso in Italy , before the relationship ended later that year . Grant became a naturalized United States citizen on June 26 , 1942 , at which time he also legally changed his name from \" Archibald Alexander Leach \" to \" Cary Grant \" . That year he married Barbara Hutton , one of the wealthiest women in the world following a $ 50 million inheritance from her grandfather , Frank Winfield Woolworth . The couple was derisively nicknamed \" Cash and Cary \" , although in an extensive prenuptial agreement Grant refused any financial settlement in the event of a divorce , to avoid the accusation that he married for money . Towards the end of their marriage they lived in a white mansion at 10615 Bellagio Road in Bel Air . After divorcing in 1945 , they remained the \" fondest of friends \" . After dating Betty Hensel for a period , on December 25 , 1949 , Grant married Betsy Drake , the co-star of two of his films . This would prove to be his longest marriage , ending on August 14 , 1962 . Grant married Dyan Cannon on July 22 , 1965 , at friend Howard Hughes 's Desert Inn in Las Vegas . Their daughter , Jennifer , was born on February 26 , 1966 . Jennifer is Grant 's only child . He frequently called Jennifer his \" best production \" . He said of fatherhood : \" My life changed the day Jennifer was born . I 've come to think that the reason we 're put on this earth is to procreate . To leave something behind . Not films , because you know that I don 't think my films will last very long once I 'm gone . But another human being . That 's what 's important . \" Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968 . On March 12 that month he was involved in a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine . Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising . Grant had a brief affair with self-proclaimed actress Cynthia Bouron in the late 1960s , Grant , who had been at odds with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1958 , was named as the recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 1970 . Grant announced that he would attend the awards ceremony to accept his award , thus ending his twelve-year boycott of the ceremony . Two days after this announcement , Ms. Bouron filed a paternity suit against Grant and publicly stated he was the father of her seven-week-old daughter . Bouron named Grant as the father on the child 's birth certificate . Grant challenged her to a blood test and Bouron failed to provide one , and the court ordered her to remove his name from the certificate . Between 1973 and 1977 he dated British photojournalist Maureen Donaldson , followed by the much younger Victoria Morgan . On April 11 , 1981 , Grant married Barbara Harris , a British hotel public relations agent who was 47 years his junior . The two had met at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London five years earlier where Harris was working at the time and Grant attending a Faberg\u00e9 conference . The two became friends , but it wasn 't until 1979 that she moved to live with him in California . Friends of Grant considered her to have had an extremely positive impact on Grant , and Prince Rainier of Monaco remarked that he had \" never been happier \" than he was in his last years with her . = = = Death = = = Grant was at the Adler Theatre in Davenport , Iowa , on the afternoon of November 29 , 1986 , preparing for his performance for the Conversation with Cary Grant when he was taken ill . Though his close friend Roderick Mann recalled that he had met up with Grant at the Hollywood Park Racetrack earlier that month and he had been in a jovial state and in good health , Grant had been feeling unwell as he arrived at the theatre . Basil Williams , who photographed him there , thought that though Grant still looked his usual suave self , he noticed that he seemed very tired and that he stumbled once in the auditorium . Williams recalls that Grant rehearsed for half an hour before \" something seemed wrong \" all of a sudden , and he disappeared backstage . Grant was taken back to the Blackhawk Hotel where he and his wife Barbara had checked in , and a doctor was called and discovered that Grant was having a massive stroke , with a blood pressure reading of 210 over 130 . Grant refused to be taken to hospital . The doctor recalled that \" The stroke was getting worse . In only fifteen minutes he deteriorated rapidly . It was terrible watching him die and not being able to help . But he wouldn 't let us \" . By 8 : 45 p.m. Grant had slipped into a coma and was taken to St. Luke 's Hospital . He spent 45 minutes in emergency before being transferred to intensive care , where he was pronounced dead at 11 : 22 p.m. He was 82 . The New York Times reported : \" Cary Grant was not supposed to die . Cary Grant was supposed to stick around . Our perpetual touchstone of charm and elegance and youth \" . Grant 's body was taken back to California , where it was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean . He refused a funeral , which Roderick Mann remarked was appropriate for \" the private man who didn 't want the nonsense of a funeral \" . The bulk of his estate , worth in the region of 60 to 80 million dollars , went to his wife Barbara Harris and his daughter Jennifer Grant . He also gave goods valued at $ 150,000 to beloved employees , $ 50,000 to the Motion Picture Relief Fund , $ 25,000 to Variety Clubs International , $ 20,000 to the John Tracy Clinic for deafness , $ 10,000 to LSD doctor Mortimer Hartman , and his clothes and personal belongings to Frank Sinatra , Roderick Mann , Stanley Donen , Kirk Kerkorian and others . = = Screen persona = = McCann notes that one of reasons that Grant was so successful with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen , acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period . George Cukor once stated : \" You see , he didn 't depend on his looks . He wasn 't a narcissist , he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man . And that made it all the more appealing , that a handsome young man was funny ; that was especially unexpected and good because we think , ' Well , if he 's a Beau Brummel , he can 't be either funny or intelligent ' , but he proved otherwise \" . Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor , and said that he was just the opposite of that , playing the \" basic man \" . Grant 's appeal was unusually broad , among both men and women ; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him . She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars differently to most of the leading players at the time , regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than \" treating them as sex objects \" . For writer David Shipman , he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be , whether it was an uncle , best friend or lover , and \" more than most stars he belonged to the public \" . A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one . Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky ( 1943 ) stated that if it \" weren 't for Cary Grant 's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all \" . For McCann Hollywood had \" found its ideal gentleman , a gentleman for a democratic culture . He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity , wealth and virtue , elite and mass , high and low , great and good \" . He states that Grant 's delivery should \" not have worked , but somehow it did \" , commenting : \" As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth , he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has , against all the odds , actually come off . He smiles at us , sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune . He smiles a smile like Gatbsy 's smile . \" Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a \" new and very important symbol \" , a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types , who represented the \" freedom , natural grace , simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan \" , which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America . McCann notes that Grant typically played \" wealthy privileged characters who never seemed to have any need to work in order to maintain their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle . He became a star whose characters were good looking , quick witted , funny and athletic , a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying \" . Martin Stirling , commenting in the biography Cary Grant : In Name Only , thought that Grant had an acting range which was \" greater than any of his contemporaries , but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor . He believes that Grant was always at his \" physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce \" . Charles Champlin , commenting in Donald Deschner 's The Complete Films of Cary Grant ( 1973 ) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant 's screen persona , in his unusual ability to \" mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes \" . He remarks that Grant was \" refreshingly able to play the near-fool , the fey idiot , without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake . His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is , as a matter of fact , probably unique among superstars . Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it \" . Wansell further notes that Grant could , \" with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint of a smile , question his own image \" , managing to \" blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done , by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously , and mixing his own unique mixture of na\u00efvet\u00e9 and worldliness \" . Stanley Donen , a director who had worked with Grant , stated that his real \" magic \" came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real , which came from \" enormous amounts of work \" rather than being God-given . Grant remarked of his career : \" I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing . I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person , Or he became me \" . He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy , unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the \" well-tailored charmer \" of Charade . Grant often poked fun at himself with statements such as , \" Everyone wants to be Cary Grant \u2014 even I want to be Cary Grant \" , and in ad-lib lines \u2014 such as in the film His Girl Friday ( 1940 ) , saying , \" Listen , the last man who said that to me was Archie Leach , just a week before he cut his throat . \" In Arsenic and Old Lace ( 1944 ) , a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach . According to a famous story now believed to be fictional , after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking , \" How old Cary Grant ? \" , Grant reportedly responded , \" Old Cary Grant fine . How you ? \" Despite his strong comedic qualities , Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles , with a mysterious , dangerous quality , remarking that \" there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on \" . Wansell notes that this darker , mysterious side extended to his personal life , which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image . = = Legacy = = Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the \" greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known \" . Schickel stated that there are \" very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant , art of a very high and subtle order \" , and thought that he was the \" best star actor there ever was in the movies \" . David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema . He was a favorite of Hitchcock , who called him \" the only actor I ever loved in my whole life \" , and remained one of Hollywood 's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years . Wansell wrote : \" To millions of movie-goers around the world , Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour , and the style , of Hollywood in its golden years . With his dark hair , and even darker eyes , mischievous smile and effortless elegance , he was , is , and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars . Since his death in 1986 , the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment \" . Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately , because he \" embodies what seems a happier time \u2212 a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer . \" Grant was nominated for two Academy Awards , for Penny Serenade ( 1941 ) and None But the Lonely Heart ( 1944 ) , but never won a competitive Oscar ; he received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970 . The inscription on his statuette read \" To Cary Grant , for his unique mastery of the art of screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues \" . On being presented with the award , his friend Frank Sinatra announced : \" It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting ... No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has , and nobody has done so many things so well \" . At the Straw Hat Awards in New York in May 1975 , Grant was awarded a special plaque which recognized the city 's appreciation of him as a \" star and superstar in entertainment \" . The following August , he was invited by Betty Ford to give a speech at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City and to attend the Bicentenary dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at the White House that same year . He was later invited to attend a royal charity gala at the London Palladium in 1978 . In 1979 , Grant hosted the American Film Institute 's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock , and presented Laurence Olivier with his honorary Oscar . In 1981 , Grant was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors . Three years later , a theatre on the MGM lot was renamed the \" Cary Grant Theatre \" . In 1995 , when over a hundred leading film directors were asked to reveal their favorite actor of all time in a Time Out poll , Grant came second only to Marlon Brando . On December 7 , 2001 , a statue of Grant was unveiled in Millennium Square , a regenerated area next to Bristol Harbour , Bristol , in the city where he was born . In November 2005 , Grant again came first in Premiere magazine 's list of \" The 50 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time \" . According to McCann , ten years earlier they had declared that Grant was \" quite simply , the funniest actor cinema has ever produced \" . = = Filmography and stage work = =",

It was the fifteenth race of the 2010 Formula One season , and the third Singapore Grand Prix held as part of the Formula One World Championship . The 61-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso who started in pole position . Sebastian Vettel finished second for Red Bull , his teammate Mark Webber was third . Alonso held off Vettel to maintain his start line advantage on the first lap . Lewis Hamilton , who started third , fought off teammate Jenson Button to retain his start position . The top two remained the same through the first and only round of pit stops . Webber 's team , Red Bull , opted to pit him early allowing him to move ahead of Hamilton . The race was neutralised by the deployment of the safety car after Kamui Kobayashi and Bruno Senna crashed on lap 31 . Hamilton retired after a collision with Webber shortly after the race restarted on lap 36 . Alonso maintained his lead throughout the remainder of the race despite pressure from Vettel . The race was Alonso 's second consecutive victory and his fourth of the 2010 season ; he had started from pole position to win the Italian Grand Prix two weeks earlier . The win meant Alonso moved into second place in the World Drivers ' Championship , eleven points behind leader Webber . Hamilton 's retirement meant he slipped to third , while Vettel 's second-place finish moved him into fourth ahead of Jenson Button . In the Constructors ' Championship Red Bull extended its lead to twenty-four points ahead of McLaren . Ferrari was a further forty points behind , with four races remaining in the season . = = Report = = = = = Background = = = The 2010 Singapore Grand Prix was the fifteenth round of the 2010 Formula One season after taking a two-week break from the previous race in Italy . The event was held at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay , Singapore on 26 September 2010 . The Grand Prix was contested by twelve teams with two drivers each . The teams ( also known as constructors ) were : McLaren , Mercedes , Red Bull , Ferrari , Williams , Renault , Force India , Toro Rosso , Lotus , Hispania , Sauber and Virgin . Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought four different tyre types to the race : two dry compounds ( super soft \" options \" and medium \" primes \" ) and two wet-weather compounds ( intermediate and full wets ) . The soft compounds were denoted by a green stripe on their side-walls ; the wet compound tyres were identified by a green line at the bottom of their central groove . The rules of 2010 Grand Prix races stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre during a race unless the driver used any one of two wet-weather compounds . Each driver was limited to eleven sets of dry tyres for the weekend . Before the race , Red Bull driver Mark Webber led the Drivers ' Championship with 187 points . He was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in second with 182 points and Fernando Alonso in third on 166 points . Hamilton 's teammate Jenson Button was fourth with 165 points , and Sebastian Vettel was fifth on 163 points . Red Bull was leading the Constructors ' Championship with 350 points ; McLaren and Ferrari were second and third with 347 and 290 points respectively , while Mercedes on 158 and Renault with 127 points contended for fourth position . Red Bull , McLaren , and Ferrari had won the previous fourteen races of the season ( with victories being taken by Alonso , Button , Vettel , Hamilton and Webber ) . Felipe Massa ( twice ) , Robert Kubica had finished in second place , and Nico Rosberg ( three times ) , Massa ( twice ) and Kubica ( once ) had all finished in third . Singapore was a critical race in the championship as all five drivers had a chance to take the lead with a victory . The situation was made difficult for Alonso as he had used his allocation of eight engines following the Italian Grand Prix , and to replace one would incur a ten-place grid penalty . His rivals each had at least one untouched engine in reserve ; Webber had two . Nevertheless , Alonso set himself the target to score points in Singapore . He also acknowledged that his car was not the fastest in the field and felt he needed five podiums in the season 's five remaining races . Webber stated that he was expecting Singapore to be a tough weekend for him after he had retired from the event in 2008 and 2009 , but felt there was still some time before a driver clinched the championship . After crashing out of the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix , Hamilton said he would push hard to stay in the running for the championship : \" I 'll take each race as it comes , but I 'll also be making sure I get to the finish of the next five races , that 's more important than anything . I go to Singapore to win . \" Hamilton felt Alonso was the favourite to win the Singapore Grand Prix and viewed the Spanish driver as his main rival for the Drivers ' Championship which was shared by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner . Button himself believed Alonso would have an extra advantage as the Spaniard 's teammate Massa was out of contention for the title . The Marina Bay Street Circuit was resurfaced between turns three and seven , along with turns thirteen to seventeen , after drivers complained about its bumpiness following the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix . The Singapore Sling chicane was adjusted to allow for a more gradual curve to exist which enabled a safer exit for drivers . The outside wall at turn 21 was brought closer towards the race track to cover up half of a drain which was previously exposed to cars , and the pit lane was resurfaced to allow for a smoother exit for drivers rejoining the circuit . Hamilton , a vocal critic of the circuit 's condition , described it as \" dangerous \" because it had remained uneven , and said the Singapore Sling chicane was \" the worst corner I have ever driven in Formula One \" despite the safety modifications made to it . The organisers of the Singapore Grand Prix introduced a new machine to clean the surface of the track after drivers had problems with a dusty and slippery track surface in the previous year 's race . Two days before the first practice session , drivers expressed concerns over low visibility caused by rain showers combined with the glare from the circuit lighting . There were two driver changes heading into the Grand Prix . Hispania Racing announced that Sakon Yamamoto , one of the team 's drivers since the tenth race of the season , was to be replaced for the weekend by the team 's reserve driver Christian Klien because he was suffering from food poisoning . Several journalists noticed a seemingly healthy Yamamoto in the paddock , suggesting that he had been dropped for sponsorship reasons instead . Team principal Colin Kolles confirmed that the arrangement would be for one race and Yamamoto would return to the cockpit at Suzuka . Pedro de la Rosa was summarily dropped by Sauber and replaced by Pirelli test driver Nick Heidfeld , who last drove for the Sauber team in 2009 . The change was made because of de la Rosa 's poor performance relative to that of teammate Kamui Kobayashi , and Heidfeld 's knowledge of the Marina Bay Street Circuit and the Yas Marina Circuit . Several teams made modifications to their cars in preparation for the event . McLaren , Red Bull , and Williams all revised their front wings . McLaren 's revision was designed to separate airflow into two separate channels , with both directing airflow around the outside of the car 's front tyres . Red Bull 's design , used in the Friday practice sessions , had two vertical slots to the rear of its endplate along with another to avoid creating a vortex when it operated with the planes and endplate . A previous design , debuted at the British Grand Prix , was used both in qualifying and in the race . In addition , the team used a revised diffuser to allow for better management of airflow to the top of the diffuser 's side section . Williams ' design debuted for the first time and was designed to make the tyre act like a diffuser which took air in to improve its efficiency . = = = Practice and qualifying sessions = = = Three practice sessions \u2014 two on Friday and a third on Saturday \u2014 were held before the main Sunday race . The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes . The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour . The first practice session was initially held on a wet track with a clear sky after rainstorms earlier in the day left standing water on parts of the circuit , and high humidity slowed the drying process . These conditions meant drivers used intermediate tyres first before dry tyres were utilised in the session 's closing minutes . Webber set the fastest time of the first session with a late lap of 1 : 54.589 , one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second who was briefly quickest before Webber set his lap . Adrian Sutil , with a lap of 1 : 58.827 , was third fastest , ahead of Vettel and Jaime Alguersuari . Button , Vitantonio Liuzzi , S\u00e9bastien Buemi , Kubica , and Vitaly Petrov rounded out the session 's top ten fastest drivers . In the second practice session , when the track was still damp in some sections , Vettel set the fastest time of the night , a lap of 1 : 46.660 on super-soft tyres ; Webber finished with the second fastest lap . Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap , half a second off Vettel 's pace . Alonso , who was fourth fastest , ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner ; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track . Hamilton was fifth , with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places . The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth ; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher , separated by Kubica . Sutil 's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session , and Alguersuari 's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car . Sutil was fined US $ 10,000 ( \u00a3 6,300 ) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a safe position on the circuit . Rain hit the circuit on Saturday afternoon , ending three hours before the session started , resulting in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot . Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates making it difficult for drivers to tell precisely how wet or dry certain corners were . The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed . Some drivers ran deep into turn five . Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1 : 48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period . The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso . Hamilton was third fastest , two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa . Rosberg was fifth , ahead of Webber and Nico H\u00fclkenberg . Kubica , Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying . Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna 's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun . Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car , causing the yellow-flags to be shown ; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available . The qualifying session held on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts . The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower from qualifying . The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen . The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position . Cars which competed in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres before the race ; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times . It was held in dry weather conditions . Alonso was fastest in the first and third sessions , and clinched his second consecutive pole position with a lap time of 1 : 45.390 which he set on his first run of the third session . He was restricted to one timed lap in the second session because of an engine mapping problem , which meant Ferrari immediately re-programmed Alonso 's engine upon discovering the issue . Alonso was joined on the front row of the grid by Vettel , who recorded a lap 0.067 seconds off Alonso 's pace , and felt he could have taken pole position as he misjudged a gap while following Schumacher and brushed the wall exiting the Singapore Sling chicane . Hamilton qualified third and was happy with his starting position despite losing downforce on the track 's final sector while running in teammate Button 's tow . Button secured fourth and pushed hard in the final session which meant he had slight damage to his rear tyres on his first run , and could not get the optimum tyre temperature in the first section on his second run . Webber managed fifth and admitted that he was struggling to find a good rhythm when driving the circuit . Barrichello qualified in sixth . The two Mercedes drivers took seventh and ninth ; Rosberg ahead of Schumacher . Rosberg believed that he should have performed better in qualifying than in the practice session , as he felt the soft tyres lacked grip ; Schumacher was satisfied with his qualifying performance . The Mercedes drivers were separated by Kubica , in the faster Renault , who was happy with his lap time despite his car sliding from a lack of grip . Kobayashi rounded out the top ten qualifiers . Alguersuari , who qualified eleventh , was the fastest driver not advancing to the final session . His best time of 1 : 47.666 was 1.8 seconds slower than Vettel 's pace in the second session . Alguersuari 's time was followed by H\u00fclkenberg , who was backed up by Sutil on his first run in the second session , and described his car 's balance like \" night and day \" . However , H\u00fclkenberg was demoted five positions on the grid after the Williams team changed his gearbox after the race at Monza . As a consequence , Petrov inherited 12th position having pushed hard on a set of option tyres . He had lost control of his car after he went deep , under braking , heading for turn five ( a corner that was damp from the earlier rain shower ) , with his right-rear wheel hitting the wall . Petrov 's crash meant he took no further part in qualifying . He was ahead of Buemi , in the slower of the two Torro Rossos , who lost a large amount of grip and got stuck in traffic . Heidfeld took 14th ahead of his fellow countryman Sutil in 15th . Liuzzi had a problem with his front brakes on the first run of the second session and managed 16th . Timo Glock , Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas di Grassi were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying . The eleventh row of the grid was filled by Jarno Trulli and Klien . Senna took 23rd . Massa was unable to set a timed lap as his gearbox seized without warning forcing him to stop on the circuit ; Ferrari chose to replace his engine and gearbox as a precaution . Massa 's engine change was his ninth of the season which incurred a ten-place grid penalty , but since he started from 24th position , the penalty was nullified . = = = Race = = = The race began at 20 : 00 SST ( UTC + 8 ) . The conditions on the grid were dry and cloudy before the race ; the air temperature ranged between 29 \u2013 32 \u00b0 C ( 84 \u2013 90 \u00b0 F ) and the track temperature was 31 \u00b0 C ( 88 \u00b0 F ) ; no rain was predicted during the race . Most drivers started on the super-soft compound tyre . Alguersuari started from the pit lane as his team discovered a coolant leak in his car . As the five red lights went out to signal the start of the race , Alonso maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner and withstood Vettel 's attempt to pass him . Button got an early advantage over teammate Hamilton , but Hamilton fought him to retain third place . Barrichello fell from sixth to eighth place . Kubica passed Rosberg at the start but the German regained the sixth position in the same lap . Further down the field , the early momentum was broken when Heidfeld , attempting to overtake both Force India cars at turn seven , hit Sutil 's rear , damaging his front wing . Liuzzi subsequently went into Heidfeld 's rear-end after the latter squeezed him towards the wall , causing front wing damage to his car . Heidfeld made a pit stop for a replacement front wing at the end of lap one , while Massa made his only pit stop of the race for the medium compound tyres . Liuzzi pulled over to the inside of the circuit on the third lap , at turn ten , with left-rear suspension damage resulting from contact with the wall . His retirement triggered the deployment of the safety car as marshals were required to push his car away from the track . Webber was the only top running driver to pit for the medium compound tyres during the safety car period on lap four . Red Bull had told Webber to enter the pit lane , assuring him that it was the right decision , though he questioned the move . Several drivers towards the rear also chose to pit . Racing resumed at the end of lap five when the safety car pulled into the pit lane . Webber immediately pushed hard and passed Glock for tenth position and a line of cars began to form behind Glock . Alonso began to pull away from Vettel as he set consecutive fastest laps . Webber passed Kobayashi at turn five to move into ninth on lap seven , and withstood an attempt to Kobayashi to reclaim ninth heading into turn seven . H\u00fclkenberg and Petrov 's wheels made contact and both drivers went off the circuit on the same lap ; H\u00fclkenberg managed to move ahead of Petrov with Massa taking advantage to pass the Renault driver . Webber caught Schumacher on lap 11 and passed the Mercedes driver on the same lap at turn five after Schumacher ran wide . Vettel was told by his team to cool his brakes on the same lap as Alonso continued to extend his lead . Sutil got ahead of Glock for eleventh place three laps later and started to pull away from the queue behind Glock . H\u00fclkenberg ran wide at turn seven on the same lap but did not lose any positions . H\u00fclkenberg passed Glock in the first sector of the track for twelfth on lap 16 . Vettel and Alonso traded fastest laps as they pushed hard in their efforts to build up a sufficient lead over Webber to maintain first and second positions after their pit stops . Massa , Petrov , Buemi and Alguersuari all passed Glock on lap 17 thus eliminating the queue of cars . By lap 20 , Alonso was leading Vettel by 3.2 seconds ; he in turn was a further 11 seconds in front of Hamilton . Button was in fourth , 20 seconds behind Alonso , with Rosberg 3.3 seconds behind the World Champion in fifth . Webber changed his engine settings to give him a higher top speed in an attempt to get past Barrichello and decrease the time gap to Hamilton on lap 22 . He avoided colliding with an Armco barrier at the entry of turn eighteen one lap later . Hamilton was told to increase his pace on the 24th lap to try to stay ahead of Webber after the pit stop phase . But his car had a large amount of oversteer , as his rear , super-soft , compound tyres began to deteriorate , causing his lap times to drop off the leader 's pace . Trulli drove to the pit lane and was pushed by his mechanics into the Lotus garage to retire with an hydraulic issue on lap 28 . Hamilton made the first scheduled stop for tyres on lap 29 and re-emerged in eighth position behind Webber . Alonso and Vettel made simultaneous pit stops on the following lap ; Alonso retained his lead despite Vettel 's pit crew completing their pit stop first ; Vettel avoided stalling and drove away in second gear . With newer tyres which provided more grip , Vettel recorded faster lap times than Alonso to close the time gap as the two came across slower cars . Kobayashi attempted to pass around the outside of Schumacher on lap 31 but the two made contact with Schumacher subsequently hitting a barrier . Kobayashi damaged his Sauber , losing control of his rear-end , and crashed at the exit of turn 18 after his front wing was knocked off entering the corner . Senna was slow to react and buried his Hispania nose-first into the barrier alongside Kobayashi . These incidents called for the race 's second safety car period to allow removal of both cars from the circuit which were on the racing line . Klien was pushed into his garage to retire with an hydraulic problem on lap 34 . The safety car pulled into the pit lane at the end of lap 35 and the race resumed with Alonso leading . Hamilton got a run on Webber who was caught behind di Grassi and lined up an overtaking manoeuvre on the Red Bull driver , and overtook him on the Raffles Boulevard straight . Webber 's front-right tyre hit Hamilton 's left-rear tyre at turn seven . He escaped without significant damage , while Hamilton had a punctured tyre and pulled off the circuit to retire for the second consecutive race . However , Webber did feel vibrations on the front-end of his Red Bull . His tyre , which made contact with Hamilton 's , had been pushed 5 millimetres off its normal mounting on the rim , and Button drew closer to Webber who managed to maintain a good pace . On lap 37 , Schumacher went into Heidfeld 's rear-end and limped back to the pit lane to replace his damaged front wing creating sparks as it was dragged along the surface of the track , while Heidfeld retired after hitting a barrier . Button was urged by his McLaren mechanics on lap 42 to push Webber whose tyres were older , while Vettel gradually closed the gap with Alonso . H\u00fclkenberg , in ninth , made a mistake on lap 44 which allowed Massa to momentarily take advantage , but he fought back and retained ninth position . Kubica sustained a right-rear puncture on lap 46 and made a pit stop on the same lap , rejoining in 13th . Upfront , Vettel had reduced the gap between himself and Alonso to one second by lap 50 as the pair continued to trade the fastest lap time . Glock started to slow on the circuit and drove to the pit lane to retire . It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car 's hydraulic system . With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip , Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari , Buemi , his teammate Petrov , Massa , H\u00fclkenberg , and Sutil ( who was holding up a queue of five cars ) in the space of nine laps . Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars . Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap , with the Lotus driver spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso , who was quick to avoid a head-on collision . Kovalainen 's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane , the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns . Kovalainen aborted the pit entry , but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire . Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher . As Kovalainen was off the racing line , yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment . Vettel drew to within two-tenths of a second behind Alonso as the final lap started , and came across Sutil , H\u00fclkenberg , Petrov and Massa ; both drivers managed to get past Petrov , and Alonso maintained the first position heading into the final sector of the track . The yellow flag for Kovalainen 's car meant that Vettel 's final chance of an overtake , into the final corner , was denied , and Alonso took the checkered flag on lap 61 to win the race , 0.293 seconds ahead of Vettel . Alonso secured the first , and , as of 2015 , the only Grand Chelem ( leading the entire race from pole position with fastest lap ) of his career as well as the first since Schumacher achieved the feat at the 2004 Hungarian Grand Prix . Webber was third , 1.2 seconds ahead of Button in fourth . Rosberg , Barrichello and Kubica took the next three positions . Sutil held off H\u00fclkenberg in the final sector of the track for eighth and ninth on the line with Massa in tenth . Petrov , Alguersuari , Schumacher and Buemi finished one lap behind Alonso , with di Grassi and Kovalainen ( despite his retirement ) the last of the classified finishers . = = = Post-race = = = The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and , in a later press conference , Alonso said that his victory \" meant a lot \" for him to remain in contention for the Drivers ' Championship and thanked his team for their efforts during the weekend . Alonso added that Ferrari would give \" 100 per cent \" in the season 's four remaining races and said the battle remained \" very tight \" despite scoring the most points out of all the drivers in the previous five races . Vettel said that he was hoping that Alonso would make a mistake but acknowledged that it was difficult to overtake on the circuit . He also said that attempting to overtake Alonso in the final stages of the race was \" the only chance \" that he had of winning the race and hoped that the remaining tracks would suit his Red Bull car . Webber stated that he was \" very happy \" with his third-place finish and said the entire race weekend was the toughest of the year on him . He also said that he did not feel comfortable throughout the weekend and that he was staying composed through certain sections of the race . Alonso 's win his been regarded as one of the best of his Formula One career . Former Formula One driver Martin Brundle described it as : \" one of those races in which two drivers elevate themselves on to a separate plane from their rivals . \" It reminded him of the 2000 Japanese Grand Prix where Schumacher won that year 's world championship from his main rival Mika H\u00e4kkinen . Will Saunders of crash.net said in 2014 that Alonso : \" had little right to wrestle a performance of such magnitude out of either himself or the Ferrari , yet he found another level that day . \" After the eventual conclusion of the championship in Vettel 's favour by four points , Saunders said : \" Alonso 's performance in Singapore showed he would have been an equally deserving championship victor . \" ESPN listed it as one of Alonso 's top ten races while driving for Ferrari . The stewards immediately investigated the accident between Webber and Hamilton on lap 37 and took no further action . Hamilton later reviewed the incident on video and was adamant that he was not at fault saying that he was \" unlucky \" for the second consecutive Grand Prix . Webber stated the contact nearly forced him to retire and compared the accident to Hamilton 's collision with Massa at the Italian Grand Prix . Brundle felt Hamilton should have given Webber more space and agreed with the stewards ' decision . Bridgestone director of motorsport tyre development Hirohide Hamashima stated Webber was \" very lucky \" to make the finish and that if left hand high-speed corners were installed on the track , the tyre would have moved more frequently and lost its pressure . Horner had also admitted that Webber had been lucky with his tyre lasting for a long distance . Schumacher and Heidfeld 's accident on lap 37 was investigated by the stewards who took no further action after deciding it was a \" racing incident \" . Heidfeld felt Schumacher had braked too late and hoped that he would have had a better finishing position . Schumacher himself said that he was not happy with his first race in Singapore but enjoyed the second half of the race . BBC pundit , and former team principal , Eddie Jordan was highly critical of Schumacher arguing that the German driver should have been sacked by Mercedes to prevent him from being \" slaughtered \" in the event he was unable to win another race . Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn came to Schumacher 's defense and said his team was \" happy \" with his contribution . Motorsport pundits criticised Kovalainen 's decision to stop his car on the pit straight after it had caught fire and argued that he was \" irresponsible \" . Kovalainen defended his action arguing that it had not been safe to drive his Lotus into the pitlane . Nevertheless , Kovalainen 's fire was voted the Moment of the Year by readers of Autosport magazine in December 2010 at the Autosport Awards held in London . Sutil was given a 20-second time penalty by the stewards as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap . This demoted him from eighth to tenth , and promoted H\u00fclkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth . Following a protest from Force India , H\u00fclkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting . This ruling meant H\u00fclkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth . Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil 's penalty following the decision , and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards ' judgement . The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi . Kobayashi admitted that he was at fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi 's accident and felt his own accident was unavoidable . As a consequence of the race , Webber 's third-place finish allowed him to increase his lead in the World Drivers ' Championship . Alonso 's victory allowed him to move up into second place , eleven points behind Webber . Hamilton 's retirement meant that he slipped to third place , nine points behind Alonso . Vettel 's second-place finish resulted in him moving into fourth place ahead of Button . In the World Constructors ' Championship , Red Bull 's strong finish allowed them to draw further ahead of McLaren who were now twenty-four points behind . Ferrari remained in third on 319 points , forty points behind McLaren . Mercedes increased their points advantage over Renault to thirty-five with four races remaining in the season . = = Classification = = = = = Qualifying = = = Notes ^ \u2013 Nico H\u00fclkenberg was given a five-place grid penalty for changing his gearbox after the Italian Grand Prix . ^ \u2013 Felipe Massa failed to set a lap time after stopping on the circuit in the first part of the qualifying session . ^ \u2013 Ferrari replaced Massa 's gearbox and engine \u2013 his ninth for the season \u2013 after his stoppage in qualifying ; Massa could not be penalised because he had already qualified last after failing to set a time . = = = Race = = = Notes ^ \u2013 Adrian Sutil was penalised 20 seconds post-race for illegally gaining an advantage at turn seven on the first lap . ^ \u2013 Following a protest by Force India , H\u00fclkenberg was penalised 20 seconds post-race for illegally gaining an advantage . ^ \u2013 Jaime Alguersuari started from the pit lane following a coolant leak before the race . = = Championship standings after the race = = Bold text indicates who still has a theoretical chance of becoming World Champion .

It was formed in April 1943 at Townsville , Queensland , as part of North-Eastern Area Command . Led by Group Captain Charles Eaton , the wing soon deployed to Merauke , Dutch New Guinea , where it comprised three squadrons flying CAC Boomerang and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters , and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers . Eaton was succeeded by Group Captain Allan Walters in mid-1943 . No. 72 Wing took part in the defence of Torres Strait , undertaking interception , patrol and occasional ground-attack and anti-shipping duties . By July 1944 , its original squadrons had all been disbanded or transferred to other operational formations . No. 120 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron , which had arrived in May 1944 , operating Kittyhawks , remained at Merauke until February 1945 . The wing headquarters returned to Australia that May , and disbanded the following month . = = History = = No. 72 Wing was formed on 23 April 1943 at Townsville , Queensland , under the command of Group Captain Charles Eaton . Early the next month , its headquarters deployed to Merauke , described by the official history of the RAAF in World War II as \" a desolate marshy little port in Dutch New Guinea \" . Controlling No. 84 Squadron ( flying CAC Boomerang fighters ) , No. 86 Squadron ( P-40 Kittyhawk fighters ) , and No. 12 Squadron ( A-31 Vengeance dive bombers ) , the wing 's purpose was to assist in the defence of Torres Strait . The Boomerangs , operating out of Horn Island , undertook air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea , first making contact with enemy forces on 16 May 1943 ; they exchanged fire with three Japanese bombers , but the latter escaped into cloud . Merauke airfield was only completed in late June , and Nos. 86 and 12 Squadrons began arriving early the next month ; by then the wing had also acquired No. 44 Operational Base Unit and its own medical receiving station and mobile fighter sector headquarters . Eaton 's relations with North-Eastern Area Command in Townsville had meanwhile became strained . In his opinion , \" the problems of Merauke were not understood from there ... mountains were made out of molehills \" , and he was posted that July to lead a bombing and gunnery establishment in South Australia . Later in the year he would form No. 79 Wing at Batchelor , Northern Territory . Group Captain Allan Walters , formerly in charge of No. 1 ( Fighter ) Wing in Darwin , assumed command of No. 72 Wing following Eaton 's reassignment . Enemy contact was generally sporadic and inconclusive , but on 9 September 1943 a force of over thirty Japanese bombers and escorting fighters heading for Merauke were intercepted by fourteen of No. 72 Wing 's Kittyhawks and four of its Boomerangs ; although most of the Kittyhawks ' guns failed to fire through oil clogging , and none of the Boomerangs made contact , the Australian aircraft claimed one bomber and two fighters destroyed without loss . No. 12 Squadron became fully operational at Merauke in September , but was mainly given patrol duty and only rarely saw enemy activity . The following month , No. 84 Squadron converted to Kittyhawks and transferred to a new formation , No. 75 Wing , which controlled units on Horn Island , Thursday Island and Higgins Field . During late 1943 and early 1944 , No. 86 Squadron was actively engaged in air defence , enjoying some success against Japanese bombers and their escorts , as well as participating in attacks on infrastructure and shipping in Dutch New Guinea . No. 86 Squadron departed Merauke on 25 April 1944 ; the squadron was subsequently reduced to a cadre and its Kittyhawks transferred to Nos. 78 and 81 Wings of No. 10 Operational Group on Noemfoor Island . It was replaced by the Dutch-Australian No. 120 Squadron , which arrived from Canberra in early May and became operational on the 9th of the month . The same month , Walters handed over command of the wing to Group Captain Bill Hely . In July , No. 12 Squadron was withdrawn to Strathpine , Queensland , where it was reduced to cadre status ahead of converting to B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and eventually serving with another new formation , No. 85 Wing . Hely departed in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation , No. 84 Wing , at Cairns . Most of the RAAF units at Merauke were redeployed in late 1944 but No. 120 Squadron remained there until February 1945 , when it was declared non-operational . The squadron returned to operational status and departed for eventual service at Biak in April that year . No. 72 Wing headquarters returned to Townsville in May 1945 , disbanding on 20 June .",

It was formed in December 1943 at Batchelor , Northern Territory , as part of North-Western Area Command . Led by Group Captain Charles Eaton , the wing comprised four squadrons on its establishment , flying Beaufort and B-25 Mitchell bombers and Beaufighter heavy fighters . No. 79 Wing took part in the New Guinea and North-Western Area Campaigns during 1944 \u2013 45 , eventually transferring to Balikpapan in the Dutch East Indies as the Allies advanced northward . By the end of the Pacific War , the wing was attached to the Australian First Tactical Air Force and was made up of Nos. 2 and 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadrons , both flying Mitchells . The latter transferred to the Netherlands Air Force in late 1945 , while the former returned to Australia where it disbanded the following year . No. 79 Headquarters itself disbanded in October 1945 , soon after the end of hostilities . = = History = = No. 79 Wing was established at Batchelor , Northern Territory , on 30 November 1943 . Its combat units consisted of Nos. 1 and 2 Squadrons ( flying Beaufort light reconnaissance bombers ) , No. 31 Squadron ( Beaufighter long-range fighters ) , and No. 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron ( B-25 Mitchell medium bombers ) . The wing was commanded by Group Captain Charles Eaton , whose Dutch personnel called him \" Oom Charles \" ( Uncle Charles ) . Operating under the auspices of North-Western Area Command ( NWA ) , Darwin , No. 79 Wing participated in the New Guinea and North-Western Area Campaigns during 1944 . Through March \u2013 April 1944 , the Beaufighters attacked Japanese shipping , while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed Timor on a daily basis as a prelude to Operations Reckless and Persecution , the invasions of Hollandia and Aitape . Eaton organised a large raid against Su , Dutch Timor , on 19 April . Consisting of thirty-five Mitchells , Beauforts and Beaufighters , the force destroyed the town 's barracks and fuel dumps , a result that earned the personal congratulations of the Air Officer Commanding NWA , Air Vice Marshal \" King \" Cole . On the day of the Allied landings , 22 April , the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on Dili , Portuguese Timor . The ground assault on Hollandia \u2013 Aitape met little opposition , credited in part to the air bombardment leading up to it . In May 1944 , Nos. 1 , 18 and 31 Squadrons attacked Japanese positions in Timor , while No. 2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells . No. 79 Wing 's light and medium bombers suffered from a lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which to refuel . No. 2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June . That month , No. 18 Squadron flew 149 sorties , damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area , but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid . In June \u2013 July 1944 , No. 79 Wing supported the Allied attack on Noemfoor . No. 18 Squadron was again the wing 's most active unit , flying 107 sorties . In September , the Beaufighters and Mitchells attacked Japanese shipping and infrastructure in Ceram and Celebes , but lost nine aircraft and twenty-six crewmen killed , among them Squadron Leader Wilbur Wackett , son of Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation manager Lawrence Wackett . By the end of the month , Mitchell missions were put on hold while replacement crews were trained . In late 1944 , plans were made to transfer No. 79 Wing from North-Western Area Command to Northern Command in Papua New Guinea , where it would undertake operations against the Japanese in New Britain . The wing 's composition for this move was to be Nos. 2 and 18 Squadrons , operating Mitchells , and 120 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron , operating P-40 Kittyhawks . No. 31 Squadron was transferred from No. 79 Wing to the Australian First Tactical Air Force at Morotai in December . The same month , Group Captain Eaton posted out and was replaced by Group Captain John Ryland . Weather hampered the wing 's activities in January 1945 . No. 1 Squadron was withdrawn to Queensland to re-equip with Mosquitos , with No. 13 Squadron , flying Venturas , taking up the slack on anti-shipping missions . The squadron accounted for around half of the thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No. 79 Wing in February , and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month . Wing operations were cut back in March , as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to Jacquinot Bay in New Britain . On 6 April , all twenty available aircraft of Nos. 2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join B-24 Liberators of No. 82 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu . The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off Sumba so the latter , at the very limit of their range , attacked the convoy regardless . They claimed two direct hits without loss , despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships , and frontal attacks by enemy fighters . Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the next day . The wing 's proposed move to New Britain was cancelled in May 1945 , after the Netherlands government requested that its squadrons operate over the Dutch East Indies . No. 120 Squadron was transferred to Biak , while No. 79 Wing and its two Mitchell squadrons were ordered to move to Borneo , under the command of First Tactical Air Force . By July , No. 79 Wing had relocated from Batchelor to Balikpapan , leaving No. 13 Squadron under the control of North-Western Area Command . After the Pacific War ended in August 1945 , the Mitchells joined Liberators of No. 82 Wing repatriating RAAF personnel from Borneo to Australia . No. 79 Wing Headquarters was disbanded on 8 October . The following month , No. 18 Squadron was reassigned to the Netherlands Air Force . No. 2 Squadron returned to Australia in December , disbanding in mid-1946 . These were the only two squadrons in the RAAF to operate Mitchells during the war .",

It was formed in February 1943 at Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea , as part of No. 9 Operational Group . The wing initially comprised three attack squadrons flying CAC Wirraways , Douglas Bostons , and Bristol Beaufighters , with which it took part in the New Guinea campaign until mid-year . It was then reorganised with three fighter squadrons operating P-40 Kittyhawks and Supermarine Spitfires ; in this form it saw action in the New Britain and Admiralty Islands campaigns through 1943 \u2013 44 . The wing was disbanded at Los Negros in August 1944 , and by the beginning of 1945 its squadrons had been absorbed into other RAAF wings under No. 10 Operational Group ( later the Australian First Tactical Air Force ) . = = History = = = = = New Guinea campaign = = = Formed in February 1943 , No. 73 Wing consisted of No. 4 Squadron ( flying CAC Wirraways ) , No. 22 Squadron ( Douglas Bostons ) and No. 30 Squadron ( Bristol Beaufighters ) . Based at Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea , the wing was under the control of No. 9 Operational Group , the RAAF 's \" premier fighting unit \" in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , whose purpose was to act as a mobile strike force in support of advancing Allied troops . In March 1943 , No. 73 Wing 's units participated in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , \" the decisive aerial engagement \" in the SWPA according to General Douglas MacArthur , that resulted in twelve ships from a Japanese convoy being sunk . During this engagement , some of No. 22 Squadron 's Bostons struck Lae airfield to prevent Japanese fighters taking off to intercept Allied bombers , while others took part in the actual assault on the convoy ; No. 30 Squadron 's Beaufighters launched \" withering \" low-level cannon and machine-gun attacks on the Japanese ships to suppress anti-aircraft fire prior to bombing runs by USAAF B-25 Mitchells . Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton , one of the Boston pilots who attacked Lae , was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for pressing home bombing missions against Salamaua later that month , in spite of severe damage to his aircraft . Having earlier been led by Wing Commander Blake Pelly , by June 1943 No. 73 Wing was under the command of Group Captain Ian McLachlan . That month , McLachlan established his headquarters at Goodenough Island , where the wing was reorganised as a fighter formation consisting of No. 76 Squadron ( flying P-40 Kittyhawks ) , No. 77 Squadron ( Kittyhawks ) and No. 79 Squadron ( Supermarine Spitfires ) . As well as providing local air defence , and fighter escort for Australian bombers , the Kittyhawks were themselves armed with incendiary and general-purpose bombs so that they could engage in ground-attack missions , a practice that had already been employed by Commonwealth forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre . In August 1943 , the wing transferred to Kiriwina , while No. 9 Group 's other combat formation , No. 71 Wing , took over responsibility for Goodenough . Transport delays meant that No. 77 Squadron remained at Goodenough , however , and its place in No. 73 Wing at Kiriwina was taken by No. 78 Squadron , which arrived from Australia in November , also equipped with Kittyhawks . = = = New Britain and Admiralty Islands campaigns = = = Wing Commander Gordon Steege assumed command of No. 73 Wing in October 1943 . Minimal offensive air activity by the Japanese meant that No. 79 Squadron 's Spitfires saw relatively little action , while in contrast the wing 's P-40s with their ground attack capability were \" fully engaged \" . As part of the build-up to the Battle of Arawe in December , the Kittyhawks launched a series of attacks on the Gasmata airfield and fuel dumps ; on the day of the Allied landings , as No. 76 Squadron Kittyhawks patrolled above the beaches , the Spitfires remained at Kiriwina in case of strikes by Japanese raiders , though none came . In January 1944 , the wing 's Spitfires and Kittyhawks accompanied Beauforts on the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time , each involving over 70 aircraft attacking enemy camps and depots at Lindenhafen , New Britain . As part of No. 9 Group 's contribution to the Admiralty Islands campaign , No. 73 Wing took up garrison duties at Los Negros commencing in March 1944 . Its complement of combat squadrons was again Nos. 76 , 77 and 79 Squadrons , supported by No. 49 Operational Base Unit , No. 114 Mobile Fighter Sector , No. 27 Air Stores Park and No. 26 Medical Clearing Station , among other ancillaries , with total ground staff numbering approximately 900 . The fighters ' primary duty was providing air cover for Allied shipping ; they also carried out bomber escort , ground attack and anti-shipping missions in the region . In mid-April , the wing escorted the largest Allied convoy in the South-West Pacific to that date , 80 ships carrying 30,000 personnel , from Finschhafen to Aitape . Completing its garrison work in the Admiralties that June , No. 73 Wing was disbanded at Los Negros on 29 August 1944 . Its combat units were all eventually transferred to other formations under No. 10 Operational Group ( later renamed the Australian First Tactical Air Force ) . Nos. 76 and 77 Squadrons joined another Kittyhawk unit , No. 82 Squadron , at No. 81 Wing on Noemfoor under Steege 's command , while No. 79 Squadron was withdrawn to Darwin in November to re-equip with new Spitfires before joining No. 80 Wing and returning to the Pacific at Morotai in March 1945 .",

It was formed in November 1950 as No. 30 Communications Unit and based at Iwakuni , Japan , as part of No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing . The unit was initially equipped with four Douglas C \u2013 47 Dakotas and two Austers , one of the Dakotas being the personal transport of Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson , commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) . Another four Dakotas were sent to Japan due to operational demands . The unit 's role in Korea was to support No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron by transporting supplies and equipment . It also delivered materials and stores to Australian and Commonwealth ground forces , and transported VIPs of the United Nations Command . Return journeys to Japan were often used to evacuate wounded personnel from the theatre . No. 30 Communications Unit was redesignated No. 30 Transport Unit in November 1951 , and re-formed as No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron in March 1953 . The squadron remained in Korea following the armistice , and returned to Australia in June 1955 . = = History = = When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950 , No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) was based at Iwakuni , Japan , having served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) for four years . Equipped primarily with North American P-51 Mustangs , the squadron also operated a communications flight of two Douglas C-47 Dakotas and two Austers . Personnel were preparing to return to Australia when they were placed on standby for action over Korea ; the Mustangs began flying missions as part of United Nations Command ( UNC ) forces a week later . Following the landing at Inchon and the consequent advance northward of UNC troops , No. 77 Squadron relocated to Pohang , South Korea , on 12 October 1950 . It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni . No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing was established at the base on 20 October and given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the conflict . As well as No. 77 Squadron , this included the newly formed No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron and No. 491 ( Maintenance ) Squadron , and No. 30 Communications Flight , formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight . The flight 's original complement of two Dakotas and two Austers had been augmented in September 1950 by two more Dakotas from Australia . On 1 November , the flight was designated No. 30 Communications Unit . No. 30 Communications Unit was headquartered at Iwakuni , along with the rest of No. 91 Wing 's components except No. 77 Squadron , which was based on the Korean peninsula . It was initially commanded , unofficially , by Flight Lieutenant ( later Air Commodore ) Dave Hitchens . According to Hitchens , \" Having commanded the communications flight in No. 77 Squadron , I assumed control but had no formal authority to do so , but nobody told me to stop . \" The transport aircraft included the personal Dakota of the BCOF commander , Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson , operating under his direction . During November 1950 , the unit received another four Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron ( of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing in Malaya ) , giving it a total strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers . It supported all Australian forces in Korea . One of its key functions was medical evacuation , but it was also responsible for supply drops , search and rescue , reconnaissance , and mail delivery , as well as transporting cargo , troops , and VIPs . Unlike No. 77 Squadron , it was not tasked by the US Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control , exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan . In December 1950 the unit undertook \" Operation Haggis \" , the delivery of 180 pounds ( 82 kg ) of haggis to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders based in Suwon , Korea . The same month , a United States Air Force Mustang taking off from Suwon smashed into the cockpit of one of the Dakotas ; none of the Australian crew was injured but the aircraft had to be written off and stripped for components by No. 491 Squadron . The first official commanding officer of No. 30 Communications Unit , Squadron Leader John Gerber , took over from Hitchens on 28 January 1951 . As of 31 March , the unit 's strength was eight Dakotas and two Austers , and fifty-seven personnel including twelve officers . According to the RAAF Historical Section , a \" typical month \" ( May 1951 ) involved carrying over 1,000 troops , 180,000 pounds ( 82,000 kg ) of cargo and 95,000 pounds ( 43,000 kg ) of mail from Iwakuni to Korea , and over 1,000 troops , 380 medical evacuees , 16,000 pounds ( 7,300 kg ) of cargo and 32,000 pounds ( 15,000 kg ) of mail from Korea to Iwakuni . No. 30 Communications Unit was redesignated No. 30 Transport Unit on 5 November 1951 . One of its aircraft dropped a wreath over Hiroshima on 6 August 1952 , the seventh anniversary of the atomic bombing . As of 31 December 1952 , its strength was eight Dakotas and one CAC Wirraway , and fifty-nine personnel including eight officers . On 10 March 1953 , No. 30 Transport Unit re-formed as No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron , which had disbanded the previous day at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . Between the armistice in July and the end of August 1953 , the squadron repatriated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war . As of 30 November 1954 , its strength was seven Dakotas and one Wirraway , and eighty-seven personnel including seven officers . Elements of No. 36 Squadron began returning to Australia in January 1955 , and by the end of the month its strength was four Dakotas and one Wirraway , and fifty-eight personnel including five officers . Nominal operational control of the squadron was transferred to Fifth Air Force on 1 February 1955 , though its purpose continued to be the support of Commonwealth forces . No. 36 Squadron ceased flying on 13 March , after which its remaining elements departed Iwakuni for Australia , leaving three Dakotas and a Wirraway that formed RAAF Transport Flight ( Japan ) ; the flight operated until July 1956 and was disbanded two months later . The transportation unit suffered two fatal accidents . One of the Austers crashed on takeoff in April 1951 , killing all three occupants . A Wirraway came down in a river after striking telephone wires in June 1952 ; the pilot and passenger survived the impact but the latter subsequently died of his injuries . During the war the Dakotas carried around 100,000 passengers and over 6,000 long tons ( 6,100,000 kg ) of cargo . No. 91 Wing 's records listed 12,762 medical evacuations from Korea to Japan . Reflecting on the nature of transport work in Korea , Hitchens stated : Most of our flying was not very exciting ; but there was a lot of it . Lots of late dark nights . Lots of crowded airfields . Lots of plain hard work . [ ... ] We all shed a lot of weight .",

It was formed in March 1940 , and initially controlled units based in Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia and southern New South Wales . Headquartered at Melbourne , Southern Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence , aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries . From 1942 its operational responsibilities excluded New South Wales . The area continued to operate following the end of the war , before being re-formed in October 1953 as Training Command under the RAAF 's new functional command-and-control system . = = History = = = = = World War II = = = Prior to World War II , the Royal Australian Air Force was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne . After war broke out in September 1939 , the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure , commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units . Its initial move in this direction was to create Nos. 1 and 2 Groups to control units in Victoria and New South Wales , respectively . Then , between March 1940 and May 1941 , the RAAF divided Australia and New Guinea into four geographically based command-and-control zones : Central Area , Southern Area , Western Area , and Northern Area . The roles of these area commands were air defence , protection of adjacent sea lanes , and aerial reconnaissance . Each was led by an Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) responsible for the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary . No. 1 Group , which had been established on 20 November 1939 , was re-formed as one of the first two area commands , Southern Area , on 7 March 1940 . Headquartered in Melbourne , Southern Area Command was given control of all Air Force units in Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia and the southern Riverina district of New South Wales . Its inaugural AOC was Air Commodore Henry Wrigley , who had also led No. 1 Group . His senior administrative staff officer was Group Captain Joe Hewitt . Wrigley handed over command to Air Commodore Adrian \" King \" Cole , formerly AOC Central Area , in November 1940 . By August 1941 , the RAAF 's expanding instructional program necessitated the establishment of overarching training organisations on a semi-functional , semi-geographical basis . Accordingly , on 2 August 1941 , No. 1 ( Training ) Group was formed in Melbourne to assume responsibility for training units within Southern Area 's boundaries , while No. 2 ( Training ) Group was formed in Sydney to take over training units then under Central Area , which was disbanded ; control of other Central Area units was \" divided as convenient \" between Southern and Northern Area Commands . Air Commodore Frank Bladin held command of Southern Area from September to December 1941 . As of 20 April 1942 , operational authority over all RAAF combat infrastructure , including area commands , was invested in the newly established Allied Air Forces ( AAF ) Headquarters under South West Pacific Area Command ( SWPA ) . On 15 May , Southern Area , which by then was considered too large , yielded responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command , Eastern Area . Control of maintenance units under Southern Area was transferred to the newly established No. 4 ( Maintenance ) Group in Melbourne on 14 September . September also saw the formation of RAAF Command , led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock , to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA . Bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands , although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over Australian units . By April 1943 , Southern Area was operating two combat units : No. 67 Squadron , flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with Avro Ansons out of RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria ; and No. 86 Squadron , flying P-40 Kittyhawk fighters from Gawler , South Australia . Group Captain Ian McLachlan commanded the area from March 1944 until January 1945 , when he handed over to Group Captain Charles Eaton . The German submarine U-862 operated off southern Australia during the first months of 1945 , and the few combat units in Southern Area were heavily engaged in anti-submarine patrols , attempting unsuccessfully to locate this and any other U-boats in the vicinity . Eaton led the command through to the surrender of Japan in September , and into December 1945 . = = = Post-war reorganisation = = = Following the end of the Pacific War in August 1945 , SWPA was dissolved and RAAF Headquarters again assumed full control of all its operational formations , including the area commands . In September 1946 , the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal George Jones , proposed reducing the five extant mainland area commands ( North-Western , North-Eastern , Eastern , Southern , and Western Areas ) to three : Northern Area , covering Queensland and the Northern Territory ; Eastern Area , covering New South Wales ; and Southern Area , covering Western Australia , South Australia , Victoria and Tasmania . The proposal was part of a much larger plan to restructure the post-war RAAF ; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place . RAAF College ( which became RAAF Academy in 1961 ) was established at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , under Southern Area Command in August 1947 . The area 's later AOCs included Air Commodores Allan Walters , during 1948 \u2013 50 , and Alan Charlesworth , the last officer to command the area , during 1951 \u2013 53 . The Federal government retired Jones in 1952 and replaced him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman , RAF , who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines , establishing Home ( operational ) , Training , and Maintenance Commands . The first was re-formed from the existing Eastern Area Command , which was considered a de facto operational organisation owing to the preponderance of combat forces within its sphere . The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command , as it was already the hub of training services , controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia . The third and final functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne . The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954 , when the three new commands assumed control of all operations , training and maintenance from Western , North-Western , and North-Eastern Area Commands . = = Aftermath = = The functional commands established in 1953 \u2013 54 were revised in 1959 . Home Command was renamed Operational Command , and Training and Maintenance Commands merged to become Support Command .

Training Command was re-formed as Air Force Training Group , a force element group under Air Command , in 2006 . = = Order of battle = = As at 30 April 1942 , Southern Area 's order of battle comprised :",

                    "text": "No. 80 Wing RAAF = No. 80 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) wing of World War II . The unit was formed on 15 May 1944 and eventually comprised three squadrons equipped with Spitfire fighter aircraft . The wing 's headquarters was absorbed into the newly formed No. 11 Group on 30 July 1945 . The wing was established to provide fighter protection for an Allied offensive from Darwin in northern Australia into the eastern Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) . This operation was effectively cancelled in June 1944 , however , leaving No. 80 Wing without a clear mission . The unit remained at Darwin until it moved to Morotai in the NEI between December 1944 and March 1945 . Due to the small number of Japanese aircraft remaining in this area the Wing 's aircraft were mainly used in the ground attack role . From May 1945 to the end of the war two of No. 80 Wing 's squadrons participated in the Borneo Campaign . = = History = = = = = Darwin = = = In early 1944 General George Kenney , the commander of the Allied air forces in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , adopted a goal of landing forces at Selaru Island in the eastern NEI and establishing a bomber base there . Accordingly , in early March , Air Vice Marshal William Bostock , who led RAAF Command , presented Kenney with a proposal for the RAAF to contribute two fighter wings and several ancillary units to this operation , which at the time was scheduled for 15 June . One of these wings would be equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks and the other with Spitfires . In March Group Captain Clive Caldwell , the RAAF 's highest-scoring flying ace of the war , reluctantly accepted command of the projected Spitfire wing after his request for a transfer to Europe was rejected by Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones . In a meeting between Jones and Caldwell , Jones stated that the wing would have the highest priority for supplies and equipment . No. 80 Wing was formed at Darwin , Northern Territory on 15 May 1944 . It initially comprised No. 452 and No. 457 Squadrons , which were transferred from No. 1 Wing . Both of these squadrons had seen extensive combat over Europe and northern Australia and were based at Sattler Airfield near Darwin . The squadrons were equipped with Spitfire Vc aircraft at the time of the wing 's establishment , but received superior Mark VIII Spitfires between June and August . General Douglas MacArthur , the commander of Allied forces in the SWPA , decided on 6 June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines . This was not communicated to No. 80 Wing , however , and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August . The effective cancellation of the operation left No. 80 Wing without a clear mission , and its pilots were left with nothing to do other than train . In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth , the commander of North-Western Area , reported to Bostock that the wing 's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia . During the same period No. 80 Wing 's pilots observed that No. 1 Wing 's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations . Caldwell did not agree to this , however , as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale . = = = Morotai = = = In mid-September Bostock gained the agreement of Kenney 's headquarters to deploy No. 80 Wing to the recently captured island of Morotai in the NEI as part of a redeployment of RAAF units in the SWPA . While this raised morale within No. 80 Wing , it had only a short time to prepare to move overseas . On 8 November Caldwell received orders to begin the movement to Morotai as soon as possible , and he visited the island late that month . During this visit he observed that it was likely that supply shortages would impede the wing 's operations . No. 80 Wing 's headquarters left Darwin on 9 December and No. 452 Squadron departed on 15 December . During the squadron 's trip to Morotai three Spitfires were destroyed or damaged as a result of landing accidents at Merauke , New Guinea on 15 December . As expected , living facilities at Morotai were initially very basic , and Caldwell traded liquor for the services of US engineer units to improve the wing 's camp site . The wing began flying night defence patrols shortly after No. 452 Squadron arrived at Morotai . At the time Morotai was a major Allied base and had been attacked by Japanese aircraft on multiple occasions . During the night of 24 December a Spitfire shot down a Japanese bomber over the island . This proved to be one of the last Japanese raids on Morotai , however , and no further interceptions were made . The lack of aerial opposition meant that No. 80 Wing 's aircraft were increasingly used to strafe Japanese positions near Morotai . During January 1945 the wing flew 84 ground attack sorties , losing three Spitfires in the process . The lack of opportunities for aerial combat disappointed No. 80 Wing 's pilots and contributed to a decline in their morale . No. 80 Wing completed its move to Morotai in March . No. 457 Squadron 's Spitfires left Darwin on 6 February and arrived on the island two days later . Later that month No. 79 Squadron joined the wing at Morotai . This squadron had previously operated Spitfires in New Guinea and nearby islands before withdrawing to Darwin in January 1945 to receive Mark VIII Spitfires . The final ship carrying No. 80 Wing personnel and equipment from Darwin arrived at Morotai in early March . Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes , who had been appointed No. 80 Wing 's wing leader in October 1944 , assumed temporary command of the unit for several days in late March while Caldwell made a trip to Manila . On 31 March Wing Commander Glen Cooper assumed command from Caldwell , who had reached the end of his appointment and was disillusioned with how No. 80 Wing had been used . Dissatisfaction with the tasks being undertaken by the First Tactical Air Force ( 1TAF ) , of which No. 80 Wing was part , led to the \" Morotai Mutiny \" in April 1945 . On 19 April , Caldwell , Gibbes and six other senior 1TAF officers attempted to resign in protest against what they believed was the misuse of fighter aircraft in ground attack operations against isolated Japanese positions . While no action was taken against these officers , Caldwell and Gibbes were later court martialled for selling liquor . From May No. 80 Wing units participated in the Australian-led Borneo Campaign . No. 457 Squadron was attached to No. 81 Wing and deployed to Labuan on 18 June as part of the Operation Oboe Six landings in the Brunei Bay region . The squadron provided air defence and flew close air support sorties alongside No. 76 Squadron , and shot down a Japanese aircraft on 20 June . In April No. 452 Squadron was attached to No. 78 Wing and took part in the landing at Tarakan in May . Delays in repairing Tarakan 's airfield meant that it did not see any combat until 30 June , however . The squadron subsequently supported the landing at Balikpapan in July , and one of its Spitfires shot down a Japanese aircraft in the early hours of 24 July . During this period No. 79 Squadron remained at Morotai and continued to fly ground attack sorties against Japanese positions on the nearby island of Halmahera . On 30 July 1945 No. 80 Wing Headquarters was absorbed into the newly formed No. 11 Group . While it was intended that the wing 's three flying squadrons would come under the command of this group , in the event it only took operational control of No. 79 Squadron before the war ended . A memorial plaque for No. 80 Wing was unveiled at the Australian War Memorial on 29 November 2013 .",

It was established in October 1950 to administer RAAF units deployed in the conflict : No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron , flying North American P-51 Mustangs ; No. 30 Communications Flight , flying Austers and Douglas C-47 Dakotas ; No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron ; and No. 491 ( Maintenance ) Squadron . The wing was headquartered at Iwakuni , Japan , as were its subordinate units with the exception of No. 77 Squadron , which was based in Korea and came under the operational control of the United States Fifth Air Force . No. 30 Communications Flight was re-designated No. 30 Communications Unit in November 1950 , and No. 30 Transport Unit a year later , before re-forming as No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron in March 1953 . It undertook medical evacuation , cargo and troop transport , and courier flights . No. 77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteor jets between April and July 1951 , and operated primarily in the ground attack role from December that year . It remained in Korea on garrison duty following the July 1953 armistice , and returned to Australia in November 1954 ; No. 491 Squadron disbanded the same month . No. 36 Squadron returned to Australia in March 1955 , leaving four aircraft to equip the newly formed RAAF Transport Flight ( Japan ) , which briefly came under No. 91 Wing 's control . The following month , No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing headquarters were disbanded . = = History = = = = = Origins and formation = = = When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950 , No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) was based at Iwakuni , Japan . For the previous four years , equipped mainly with North American P-51 Mustangs , it had served with the British Commonwealth Air Group , the air component of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) , initially as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF . No. 81 Wing was disbanded in November 1948 , leaving No. 77 Squadron as Australia 's sole air unit in Japan . It was now the largest squadron in the RAAF , comprising 299 officers and men , forty Mustangs , three CAC Wirraways , two Douglas C-47 Dakotas and two Austers . The squadron was preparing to return to Australia when it was placed on standby for action over Korea ; it began flying missions as part of the United Nations ( UN ) peacekeeping force a week later . No. 77 Squadron 's commanding officer , Wing Commander Lou Spence , was killed in action on 9 September 1950 , and Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth , Chief of Staff at BCOF , temporarily took charge at Iwakuni , pending the formation of an overarching organisation for support and administration at the base . Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell arrived on 17 September to assume command of No. 77 Squadron . Following the landing at Inchon and the northward advance of UN troops , No. 77 Squadron relocated to Pohang , South Korea , on 12 October 1950 . It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni . No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing was established at the base on 20 October . The term \" composite \" referred to an RAAF formation made up of disparate operational elements , rather than one comprising a single type such as bombers or fighters . Commanded by Group Captain A.D. ( Dallas ) Charlton , No. 91 Wing was given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the Korean War . As well as No. 77 Squadron , this included the newly formed No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron and No. 491 ( Maintenance ) Squadron , and No. 30 Communications Flight , formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight and initially comprising its two Dakotas and two Austers . Apart from No. 77 Squadron , the wing 's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni . Elements of the US Far East Air Forces command favoured the establishment of a British Commonwealth Wing , to include No. 77 Squadron and the Mustang-equipped No. 2 Squadron of the South African Air Force , then en route to Korea , but the South African government vetoed the idea . = = = Operations = = = No. 77 Squadron 's tasking was controlled by the United States Fifth Air Force from the time it commenced operations in Korea , and this arrangement was not affected by the formation of No. 91 Wing . It moved forward from Pohang to Yonpo , near Hamhung , in November 1950 , continuing its support of UN forces as they advanced up the peninsula . North Korea 's counter-attack , augmented by Chinese forces , led to the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to Pusan on 3 December . Poor radio communications with No. 91 Wing dogged the evacuation from Yonpo , which was effected through US Air Force support supplementing the efforts of RAAF Dakotas . Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements , and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson , BCOF commander and the theatre 's senior Australian officer , and the RAAF 's Deputy Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger . In response to the threat of Chinese Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighters , No. 77 Squadron was withdrawn to Iwakuni in April 1951 , to re-equip with Gloster Meteors . Four Royal Air Force officers with Meteor experience were seconded to No. 91 Wing to assist with training . The squadron returned to action with its new aircraft on 29 July , operating out of Kimpo , South Korea . The Mustangs had been highly effective in close support , but No. 77 Squadron 's main role in the RAAF was interception , and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties . According to the official history of Australia in the Korean War , the unit proved its value diplomatically as well as operationally : having been one of the first UN squadrons to go into action , it comprised one-third of the jet fighter force in the latter part of 1951 , when clashes in \" MiG Alley \" were at their height . However , dogfights between Meteors and MiGs that August convinced the new commanding officer , Wing Commander Gordon Steege , that the Australian jets were outmatched , and Fifth Air Force agreed to take them out of an offensive air-to-air combat role in favour of escort and local air defence . The squadron 's loss rate by the end of the year was one in four killed or captured . Beginning in December 1951 under Steege 's replacement , Wing Commander Ron Susans , No. 77 Squadron again took up an offensive role , namely ground attack , which constituted its primary tasking for the rest of the war . Flight Lieutenant J.C. Smith , No. 91 Wing 's armament officer , played a key role in developing \" Flaming Onion \" , napalm-tipped air-to-ground rockets that were used in several operations in 1952 and 1953 . No. 77 Squadron remained in Korea on garrison duty \u2014 initially at Kimpo , later at Kunsan \u2014 following the armistice in July 1953 . It had lost forty-one pilots killed during the war . A further seven pilots became prisoners of war . Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty , including over forty Meteors , mostly to ground fire . The squadron flew 18,872 sorties , including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors . It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings , 1,408 vehicles , ninety-eight locomotives and carriages , and sixteen bridges . No. 30 Communications Flight included Robertson 's personal Dakota , operating under his direction . The unit 's complement of two Dakotas and two Austers was soon augmented by two more Dakotas from Australia . On 1 November 1950 , No. 30 Communications Flight was renamed No. 30 Communications Unit . The same month , it received another four Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron , of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing in Malaya , giving it a strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers . The unit supported all Australian forces in Korea . One of its key functions was medical evacuation , but it was also responsible for supply drops , search and rescue , reconnaissance , and mail delivery , as well as transporting cargo , troops , and VIPs . Unlike No. 77 Squadron , it was not tasked by Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control , which was exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan . No. 30 Communications Unit was re-formed as No. 30 Transport Unit on 5 November 1951 , and as No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron on 10 March 1953 . During the war it transported around 100,000 passengers and over 6,000 tons of cargo . No. 91 Wing 's records listed 12,762 medical evacuations from Korea to Japan , and over 2,000 from Japan to Australia or Britain . The transportation unit lost an Auster and a Wirraway to crashes , resulting in four deaths . = = = Support = = = When the Korean War broke out , No. 77 Squadron was self-supporting . The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea , leading to the formation of No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron at Iwakuni , at the same time as No. 91 Wing headquarters . RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative , logistical , medical , communications and security functions . Staffed mainly by former No. 77 Squadron members , in the first year of its existence No. 391 Squadron had to contend with severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment . Further problems arose following the introduction of the Meteor , as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang . Along with its RAAF responsibilities , No. 391 Squadron supported Australian Army and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni . It ran No. 91 Wing 's \" Transit Hotel \" , which accommodated business people and entertainers , as well as military personnel . The squadron 's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations . No. 491 Squadron was also formed in tandem with No. 91 Wing on 20 October 1950 . Headquartered at Iwakuni , it was responsible for all maintenance of the wing 's aircraft except day-to-day servicing . A section was attached to No. 77 Squadron in Korea to assist ground staff with daily maintenance . Personnel from Iwakuni were regularly rotated through this section , and augmented by additional No. 491 Squadron staff as needed for repair or salvage work . The standard RAAF working days for technicians at Iwakuni contrasted with shifts of up to sixteen hours near the front line in Korea . Korea was one of the coldest climates in which RAAF ground crews had ever worked ; Squadron Leader Cresswell recalled seeing maintenance staff with tools frozen to their hands . Both Nos. 391 and 491 Squadrons used Japanese technicians as well as Australian , which was unusual for the time ; during the occupation of Japan following its surrender in World War II , the RAAF had only employed Japanese workers for menial tasks . = = = Disbandment = = = No. 77 Squadron stood down at Kunsan on 7 October 1954 and flew its Meteors to Iwakuni five days later . It departed for Australia in November and became operational again at RAAF Base Williamtown , New South Wales , on 4 January 1955 . Its eleven-year absence from Australia , beginning in the Pacific during World War II and continuing in Japan as part of BCOF , was a record for an RAAF unit . No. 491 Squadron disbanded at Iwakuni on 13 December 1954 . No. 36 Squadron ceased flying on 13 March 1955 and returned to Australia , leaving behind three Dakotas and a Wirraway that equipped RAAF Transport Flight ( Japan ) , formed the following day under No. 91 Wing . No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing headquarters were disbanded at Iwakuni on 30 April 1955 . Transport Flight ( Japan ) flew a courier service to South Korea and remained operational until 8 July 1956 , when its last Dakota \u2014 the last RAAF aircraft in Japan \u2014 departed Iwakanu . = = Commanding officers = = No. 91 Wing was commanded by the following officers :",

Coming under the control of Air Mobility Group ( AMG ) , it is headquartered at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . The wing comprises No. 34 Squadron , operating Boeing 737 and Bombardier Challenger 604 VIP jets ; No. 37 Squadron , operating Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules medium transports ; and a technical training unit , No. 285 Squadron . Formed in 1944 for army co-operation duties in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II , No. 84 Wing operated a mix of aircraft including CAC Boomerangs , CAC Wirraways , Auster AOPs and Bristol Beauforts , before disbanding in 1946 . It was re-formed in 1991 as a tactical transport wing headquartered at RAAF Base Townsville , Queensland , comprising Nos. 35 and 38 Squadrons operating de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous . By 1996 , it had been augmented by No. 32 Squadron , operating Hawker Siddeley HS 748 trainer-transports . In 1998 , No. 84 Wing was reorganised as a special transport wing , headquartered at Richmond . The Caribous were transferred to No. 86 Wing and No. 84 Wing took over responsibility for No. 33 Squadron , operating Boeing 707 tanker-transports , and No. 34 Squadron , operating VIP transports , in addition to controlling No. 32 Squadron . By mid-2006 , No. 32 Squadron had converted to Beech King Air 350s and transferred to Air Force Training Group , while No. 84 Wing had assumed control of No. 285 Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit ( AMTDU ) . AMTDU was subsequently moved under the direct aegis of ALG , and No. 33 Squadron under No. 86 Wing , following the retirement of the 707s . No. 37 Squadron , by then the RAAF 's sole Hercules unit , was transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing in 2010 . No. 35 Squadron , which had been merged with No. 38 Squadron in 2000 , was re-formed under No. 84 Wing in 2013 to operate Alenia C-27J Spartan tactical transport commencing in 2015 ; the squadron was detached from the wing in January 2014 but is scheduled to return as the Spartan becomes operational . = = History = = = = = Army cooperation formation = = = The Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) established two army cooperation wings in the South West Pacific Theatre late in World War II . They were , as described by the official history of the RAAF in the Pacific , \" essentially non-offensive in character \" , responsible for reconnaissance , artillery spotting , supply drops to ground forces , spraying DDT to combat malaria , and guiding close support aircraft to their objectives . The wing 's aircraft could also carry out their own strikes on \" targets of opportunity \" . No. 84 ( Army Cooperation ) Wing was formed on 11 September 1944 in Cairns , Queensland . Commanded by Group Captain Bill Hely , it comprised No. 5 ( Tactical Reconnaissance ) Squadron , No. 17 Air Observation Post ( AOP ) Flight , No. 10 Communication Unit , and No. 39 Operational Base Unit . The wing arrived at Torokina in October to begin supporting Australian troops during the Bougainville Campaign . No. 5 Squadron , equipped with eighteen CAC Boomerangs and four CAC Wirraways , was assigned to mark targets for F4U Corsairs of the Royal New Zealand Air Force . The Austers of No. 17 AOP Flight were used for reconnaissance and courier work , becoming , in the words of the official history , \" the eyes of the battalion commanders \" . No. 10 Communications Unit flew Avro Ansons and Bristol Beauforts on courier , reconnaissance , supply , and anti-malarial spraying missions ; it was renamed No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit in March 1945 . Between December 1944 and January 1945 , the wing lost one Auster , one Wirraway , and one Boomerang on operations . Despite suffering shortages of pilots and equipment , No. 84 Wing was generally able to keep pace with the army 's requirements . A detachment of No. 36 Squadron , flying C-47 Dakotas , was employed to augment the wing 's supply capabilities . Up until the end of June 1945 , No. 5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 sorties and No. 17 AOP Flight over 1,300 , while No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No. 36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between them . As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased , demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened , and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No. 17 AOP Flight . When the Pacific War ended in August 1945 , No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit was tasked with dropping leaflets announcing the news over Japanese positions . That month , Group Captain D.R. Chapman succeeded Hely as No. 84 Wing 's commander . The end of hostilities led to morale problems owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation ; Chapman sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report to this effect , its tone earning him a rebuke from the Air Officer Commanding , Air Commodore Allan Walters . No. 17 AOP Flight was disbanded on Bougainville in December , followed a month later by No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit . No. 5 Squadron transferred to RAAF Station Pearce , Western Australia , in January 1946 , and disbanded in October that year . No. 84 Wing headquarters completed \" reduction to nucleus \" at Bougainville on 29 January 1946 . It departed Torakina and arrived in Essendon , Victoria , on 28 February , disbanding there on 6 March . = = = Transport formation = = = No. 84 Wing was re-established as a tactical transport wing under the newly formed Operational Support Group ( OSG ) at RAAF Base Townsville , Queensland , in February 1991 . It comprised two squadrons of de Havilland DHC-4 Caribous : No. 35 Squadron , located at Townsville , and No. 38 Squadron , located at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . Prior to this , the two squadrons had been under the control of Tactical Transport Group , OSG 's predecessor at Townsville . No. 84 Wing 's primary purpose was to support Australian Army operations and exercises , as well as the Parachute Training School at HMAS Albatross in Nowra , New South Wales . It also maintained detachments for search-and-rescue and local transport duties at RAAF Base Darwin , Northern Territory , and RAAF Base Pearce , Western Australia . The Pearce detachment ( No. 38 Squadron Detachment A ) was formed from No. 2 Flying Training School 's Caribou Flight on 1 March 1991 . In addition to their military role , the Caribous provided assistance to the civil community in the form of disaster relief and medical evacuation . The aircraft frequently operated in Papua New Guinea , for training and humanitarian missions . No. 38 Squadron , responsible for all Caribou aircrew conversion and operations training , transferred to RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , in October 1992 . Beginning the following month , seven of the fleet 's twenty-one Caribous were retired to storage at Amberley for use as spare parts . By mid-1996 , No. 84 Wing was under the control of Air Lift Group ( ALG ) , located at Richmond , and had been augmented by No. 32 Squadron , operating Hawker Siddeley HS 748s for navigational training , VIP transport , and fisheries surveillance out of RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria . In January 1998 , No. 84 Wing was reorganised as a special transport wing under ALG , \" special transport \" meaning activities not directly related to army support , such as carrying VIPs . Its headquarters was relocated to Richmond . In addition to No. 32 Squadron , its complement included No. 33 Squadron , operating Boeing 707s for air-to-air refuelling and VIP transport out of Richmond , and No. 34 Squadron , operating Falcon 900s for VIP transport out of RAAF Base Fairbairn in Canberra . Nos. 35 and 38 Squadrons meanwhile transferred to No. 86 Wing , also headquartered at Richmond . Two of No. 33 Squadron 's five 707s were soon employed to form No. 84 Wing Detachment A in Kuwait , as part of Operation Southern Watch . On 5 March , one of the 707s undertook the first operational aerial tanker mission since the squadron 's re-formation in 1983 , when it refuelled six Panavia Tornados of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) over Saudi Arabia . The detachment subsequently refuelled US EA-6 Prowlers , F / A-18 Hornets , and AV-8 Harriers , as well as RAF Harriers , in addition to the Tornados . From March to September 2002 , two 707s formed No. 84 Wing Detachment as part of Australia 's contribution to the war in Afghanistan . Located at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan , the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre , their efforts earning No. 84 Wing a Meritorious Unit Citation . No. 34 Squadron 's fleet of five Falcon 900s was replaced by two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s in July 2002 . The arrival of the new jets also permitted the Air Force to cease using No. 33 Squadron 's 707s in the VIP transport role . In concert with the No. 84 Wing Navigation Training Aircraft Detachment , No. 32 Squadron completed its conversion from the HS 748 to the Beech King Air 350 in December 2004 . By mid-2006 , the squadron had been transferred to Air Force Training Group and No. 84 Wing had assumed control of two Richmond-based units from the defunct No. 85 Wing , No. 285 Squadron and the Air Movements Training and Development Unit ( AMTDU ) . No. 285 Squadron undertook instruction of technical staff , and ground-based aircrew training using Hercules and Boeing 707 flight simulators . AMTDU was responsible for developing and disseminating new techniques in air transport operations . It was later moved under the direct control of Headquarters ALG . No. 33 Squadron retired its 707s in June 2008 , and subsequently relocated to Amberley under the control of No. 86 Wing . No. 37 Squadron transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing in October 2010 . It operated a mix of Lockheed C-130H Hercules and Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules , No. 86 Wing having consolidated all its C-130 operations in the one squadron , prior to re-equipping No. 36 Squadron with the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III . The Hercules , along with Globemasters and King Airs , were employed for flood relief in Queensland and Victoria early in 2011 . In February , Hercules and Globemasters transported medical staff and equipment to aid victims of the Christchurch earthquake . The same year , No. 34 Squadron provided VIP transport during the visits to Australia by Queen Elizabeth II and US President Barack Obama . No. 37 Squadron 's C-130H Hercules were retired in November 2012 ; the C-130Js are expected to remain in service until about 2030 . In February 2013 , the RAAF marked ten years rotating a detachment of three C-130s through the Middle East Area of Operations ( MEAO ) to support the Australian contribution to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , a rotation maintained by No. 37 Squadron under the auspices of No. 84 Wing . Its operations having been absorbed by No. 38 Squadron in 2000 , No. 35 Squadron was re-established under No. 84 Wing on 14 January 2013 , to operate ten Alenia C-27J Spartan tactical transports out of Richmond . The squadron was transferred to the C-27J Transition Team on 21 January 2014 , and is expected to return to No. 84 Wing 's control upon the Spartan reaching initial operating capability ; the first of the new aircraft arrived in Australia on 25 June 2015 . On 1 April 2014 , ALG was renamed Air Mobility Group .",

It was formed in June 1943 , flying Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks and , initially , Bell P-39 Airacobras from bases in Queensland and New Guinea . The squadron became operational in September 1944 , and undertook ground attack missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre . Following the end of hostilities , No. 82 Squadron was re-equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs and deployed to Japan , where it formed part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . It remained there until October 1948 , when it was disbanded . = = History = = = = = World War II = = = During 1943 , the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) received 399 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft . Their arrival allowed the service to expand its combat force by forming five new Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons to join the three squadrons that had operated the type in the South West Pacific area since 1942 . No. 82 Squadron was formed at Bankstown , New South Wales , on 18 June 1943 . It was the third of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established , following No. 84 Squadron in February and No. 86 Squadron in March ; No. 78 Squadron was formed in July and No. 80 Squadron in September . Commanded by Squadron Leader Stanley Galton , No. 82 Squadron 's original complement was 279 , including fifteen officers . It was to have been equipped wholly with P-40M Kittyhawks but initially included a flight of Bell P-39 Airacobras . No. 82 Squadron conducted training at Bankstown until April 1944 , when personnel briefly moved to Hughes Airfield in the Northern Territory , before being redeployed to Townsville , Queensland , for further training . The squadron transferred to Port Moresby , New Guinea , at the end of August 1944 and then on to Noemfoor Island in mid-September , where it joined Nos. 76 and 77 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing under No. 10 Operational Group ( later the Australian First Tactical Air Force ) . Three of No. 82 Squadron 's Kittyhawks crashed due to engine trouble while staging through Nadzab and Tadji . Operating from Kamiri strip , the squadron flew its first combat mission on 30 September , bombing Samate airstrip with aircraft from No. 77 Squadron . On 18 October , one aircraft was lost to ground fire during an attack on Kai Island , while another was reported missing . No. 82 Squadron found it difficult to remain operational as most of its ground crew remained in Townsville until moving forward the following month ; in the meantime , the pilots took responsibility for arming and refuelling their aircraft . On 23 November , they dive bombed Japanese airfields on Halmahera with aircraft of No. 76 Squadron . No. 82 Squadron continued to conduct ground attack missions in New Guinea until March 1945 , when it relocated to Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) . From Morotai , the squadron conducted ground attack missions in the NEI and escorted Allied convoys carrying troops bound for the liberation of Borneo . The relegation of First Tactical Air Force to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale , culminating in the so-called \" Morotai Mutiny \" of April 1945 . Squadron Leader Bert Grace , commanding officer of No. 82 Squadron , was among eight senior pilots who tended their resignations in protest at what they saw as the waste of resources on targets of dubious military value . The officers were persuaded to continue on operations , and Grace oversaw the squadron 's move to Labuan island in June as part of Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of North Borneo . The Kittyhawks flew in support of Australian Army units until the end of the war . On one such mission on 8 August 1945 , No. 82 Squadron made a 900-mile ( 1,400 km ) round trip to attack targets around Kuching in Sarawak . During the first strike two Japanese aircraft were destroyed as they were taking off from the airstrip , while a transport was also destroyed and two more were damaged . The fighters then attacked several barges near Kuching Town and on the Sarawak River . Fourteen members of the squadron were killed on operations during the war . = = = Occupation of Japan = = = Shortly after the end of the war , No. 82 Squadron was selected to join the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12 September and 11 January 1946 , losing two aircraft to accidents in the process . The squadron deployed to Bofu , a former kamikaze base , during 13 \u2013 18 March 1946 , once again as part of No. 81 Wing with Nos. 76 and 77 Squadrons ; Nos. 381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support , respectively . No. 82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs , along with an escorting de Havilland Mosquito , in bad weather en route to Bofu , killing all crew members . From April 1946 , the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts . The Australians found that , far from offering resistance , the Japanese went out of their way to be accommodating . No. 82 Squadron 's commanding officer , Squadron Leader Graham Falconer , remarked following a dinner with Bofu 's mayor , \" I felt that we were being treated more as visitors than as an occupying force ! \" No. 81 Wing transferred to Iwakuni in April 1948 , the same month that the Federal government determined to reduce Australia 's contribution to BCOF . As part of this reduction , Nos. 76 and 82 Squadrons were slated for disbandment , leaving No. 77 Squadron as the sole RAAF fighter unit in the country . No. 82 Squadron conducted further training and exercises until September , and was disbanded at Iwakuni on 29 October 1948 .",

Established in April 1944 , it evolved from No. 9 Operational Group , which had been the RAAF 's primary mobile formation in the South West Pacific theatre since September 1942 , but had lately become a garrison force in New Guinea . Northern Command was headquartered initially at Milne Bay and then , from August 1944 , in Madang . It conducted operations in New Guinea , New Britain , and Bougainville until the end of the war . Re-designated Northern Area in December 1945 , it was headquartered in Port Moresby from March 1946 and disbanded in February 1947 . = = History = = Prior to World War II , the Royal Australian Air Force was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne . When war broke out , the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure , commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units . Between March 1940 and May 1941 , Australia and Papua were divided into four geographically based command-and-control zones : Central Area , Southern Area , Western Area , and Northern Area . The roles of the area commands were air defence , protection of adjacent sea lanes , and aerial reconnaissance . Each was led by an Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) who controlled the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary . By mid-1942 , Central Area had been dissolved , Northern Area had been split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area , and Eastern Area was created , making a total of five commands . The static area command system was well suited to defence , but less so for an offensive posture . In September 1942 , therefore , the Air Force created a large mobile formation known as No. 9 Operational Group , to act as a self-contained tactical air force that would be able to keep pace with Allied advances through the South West Pacific theatre . By September 1943 , however , No. 9 Group had become a static garrison force in New Guinea , similar to the area commands on mainland Australia , and a new mobile group was required to support the advance north towards the Philippines and Japan . This was formed in November 1943 as No. 10 Operational Group ( later the Australian First Tactical Air Force ) , which initially came under No. 9 Group 's control . To better reflect No. 9 Group 's new status , the head of RAAF Command , Air Vice Marshal William Bostock , recommended renaming it Northern Area . RAAF Headquarters did not agree to this at first , but on 11 April 1944 settled on calling it Northern Command , under the same AOC who commanded No. 9 Group , Air Commodore Frank Lukis . On its formation the command was headquartered at Milne Bay . By July 1944 , No. 10 Group 's position in western New Guinea was complicating Northern Command 's efforts to supply it , and the group was made independent of the command . The next month , Northern Command headquarters transferred to Madang . In September , No. 71 Wing was detached from No. 10 Group to Northern Command , which had been given the task of supporting the Australian 6th Division in the Aitape \u2013 Wewak campaign . Headquartered at Tadji in northern New Guinea , No. 71 Wing comprised Nos. 7 , 8 and 100 Bristol Beaufort Squadrons , augmented by a flight of CAC Boomerangs from No. 4 ( Army Cooperation ) Squadron . No. 74 ( Composite ) Wing , which had been formed in August 1943 and was headquartered at Port Moresby , also came under the aegis of Northern Command . The command 's other major operational formation was No. 84 ( Army Cooperation ) Wing , which began moving from Australia to Torokina on Bougainville in October 1944 . By this time , Northern Command controlled six squadrons in the New Guinea area . No. 79 Wing , equipped with B-25 Mitchells , was earmarked for transfer from North-Western Area to Northern Command , to undertake operations in New Britain , but its proposed airfield was not ready and it was instead transferred to the First Tactical Air Force at Labuan the following year . Air Commodore Allan Walters took over Northern Command from Lukis in February 1945 . Walters directed operations in New Guinea , New Britain and Bougainville until the end of hostilities . Group Captain Val Hancock assumed command of No. 71 Wing in April . To maximize support to Australian ground troops in the lead-up to the final assault on Wewak , the wing 's three extant Beaufort squadrons were joined by two more , Nos. 6 and 15 . Approximately sixty Beauforts and Boomerangs struck Japanese positions behind Dove Bay prior to amphibious landings on 11 May to cut off retreating enemy troops . Over the entire month , the wing dropped more than 1,200 tons of bombs and flew in excess of 1,400 sorties . The wing suffered fuel and ordnance shortages ; at one stage its squadrons had to load their Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs . No. 84 Wing , commanded by Group Captain Bill Hely and comprising No. 5 ( Tactical Reconnaissance ) Squadron , flying mainly Boomerangs , and two reconnaissance and transport units , also suffered shortages of equipment , as well as pilots . Augmented by a detachment of No. 36 Squadron , flying C-47 Dakotas , its aircraft flew slightly over 4,000 sorties during the Bougainville campaign up to the end of June 1945 . That month , Northern Command was tasked with acting in reserve for Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of Labuan . In July , No. 11 Group was formed as a \" static command \" headquartered on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies , using elements of Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force ; this freed the latter from garrison duties while its combat units advanced towards Borneo . No. 71 Wing continued operations until the last day of the Pacific War , flying its final mission involving thirty Beauforts only hours before news arrived of the Allied victory on 15 August 1945 . No. 74 Wing was disbanded in Port Moresby the same day . No. 71 Wing squadrons subsequently dropped leaflets to remaining pockets of Japanese resistance , making them aware of the surrender ; the wing was disbanded at Tadji in January 1946 . No. 84 Wing suffered morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation ; as a result , the wing 's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report , its tone earning a rebuke from Walters . No. 84 Wing left Bougainville in February 1946 and disbanded in Melbourne the next month . Northern Command was redesignated Northern Area on 1 December 1945 , and its headquarters transferred to Port Moresby in March the following year . Walters handed over command in June 1946 . The area headquarters was disbanded at Port Moresby on 27 February 1947 .",

To minimize demand on strategic materials such as aluminum , the aircraft was mostly constructed from steel tubing and wood . Flight testing revealed a number of deficiencies , but it was ordered into production before they could be fixed . Although difficult to handle , one hundred were built before the design was modified into the MiG-3 . The aircraft was issued to fighter regiments of the Soviet Air Forces ( VVS ) in 1941 , but most were apparently destroyed during the opening days of Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 . = = Design and development = = = = = Design phase = = = The MiG-1 was designed in response to a requirement for a high-altitude fighter with an inline engine issued by the VVS in January 1939 . Initially the aircraft , designated I-200 , was designed in the Polikarpov construction bureau . Work started in June 1939 , under the direction of Nikolai Polikarpov and his assistant M. Tetivikin . Polikarpov himself preferred radial engines and promoted his I-180 design at that time , but when the powerful Mikulin AM-37 inline engine became available , he decided to use it in a fighter . The approach that he selected was to build the smallest possible aircraft around the intended powerplant , thereby minimising weight and drag \u2014 the philosophy of the light fighter . As specified , the aircraft was to be capable of reaching 670 km / h ( 417 mph ) . In August 1939 , Polikarpov fell out of favour with Joseph Stalin and as a result , when Polikarpov went in November 1939 to tour Germany 's aviation works , the Soviet authorities decided to scatter his construction team and create a new Experimental Construction Section ( OKO ) , headed by Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich , which remained formally subordinated to Polikarpov bureau until June 1940 . Further work upon the I-200 design was assigned to Mikoyan and Gurevich , who later became recognized \u2014 not with full justice \u2014 as its designers . The MiG-1 was a low-wing monoplane with a tail-dragging undercarriage of mixed construction . Due to shortages of light alloys the rear fuselage was made from wood , but the front fuselage , from the propeller to the rear of the cockpit was a welded steel tube truss covered by duralumin . The bulk of the wing was wooden , but the center section was all-metal with a steel I-section main spar . The wing used a Clark YH profile . It was evenly tapered with rounded tips and the outer wing panels had 5 \u00b0 of dihedral . All three landing gear wheels retracted hydraulically ; the main units inwards into the wing center section . The cockpit was situated well aft , which seriously limited forward vision when landing and taxiing . The AM-37 engine was not yet available and the less powerful V-12 Mikulin AM-35A had to be substituted . It had six exhaust ejectors , one for each pair of cylinders , that provided some additional thrust . It drove a VISh-22Ye controllable-pitch propeller 3 metres ( 9.8 ft ) in diameter . The air intakes for the supercharger were in the wing roots and the oil cooler was on the port side of the engine cowling . The radiator was underneath the cockpit . Armament included two fuselage-mounted 7.62 mm ( 0.300 in ) ShKAS machine guns and one 12.7 mm ( 0.50 in ) UBS machine gun . The result was a highly conventional aircraft that first flew on schedule on 5 April 1940 at the Khodynka Aerodrome in Moscow with chief test pilot Arkadij Ekatov at the controls . On 24 May the first prototype attained a speed of 648.5 km / h ( 402.9 mph ) at 6,900 m ( 22,638 ft ) . It could not , however , attain the speed originally specified by the Air Force with this engine . The second prototype took to the air on 9 May , but the third aircraft , the first to be armed , was forced to wait until 6 June , as problems with its synchronization gear prolonged the ground firing tests . On 5 August 651 km / h ( 405 mph ) was reached at 7,000 m ( 23,000 ft ) using maximum boost . Time to altitude figures were 5.1 minutes to 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) and 7.2 minutes to 7,000 m ( 23,000 ft ) and speeds at lower altitudes were 579 km / h ( 360 mph ) at 2,200 m ( 7,200 ft ) and 605 km / h ( 376 mph ) at 3,630 m ( 11,910 ft ) . = = = Production and improvements = = = The I-200 was ordered into production almost immediately , on 31 May 1940 . In contrast to the other competing designs , the I-26 ( Yak-1 ) and I-301 ( LaGG-3 ) , the I-200 successfully completed the state trials in August on its first attempt . But the trials revealed a number of serious defects , including inadequate visibility when taxiing , poor-quality plexiglas in the canopy obscuring the pilot 's view , heavy controls , poor longitudinal stability , difficulty in opening canopy , an excessively hot cockpit and a \" dangerous propensity to flick from a simple stall into a spin from which it was almost impossible to recover \" . A number of improvements were ordered to be made to the aircraft as a result of the deficiencies discovered during the trials , but only a few of them were able to be implemented before production began as the VVS was very anxious to get modern fighters into service . These included an additional air intake on the starboard side of the nose for the oil cooler , rubber sheaths around the fuel tanks to make them self-sealing , two underwing bomb racks each capable of carrying a 100-kilogram ( 220 lb ) FAB-100 bomb , a PBP-1 gunsight and each ShKAS was given 375 rounds and the UBS 300 rounds . From the ninth aircraft onwards the side-opening canopy was replaced by a rear-sliding canopy that could be jettisoned in flight . On 9 December 1940 the first 100 I-200s were designated as the MiG-1 ( after the initials of Mikoyan and Gurevich ) . The improvement process continued throughout the production run , but they weren 't immediately implemented on the production line , but were instead incorporated in a fourth prototype for evaluation . This aircraft first flew on 29 October 1940 and was a significant improvement over the I-200s then in production . It passed its State acceptance trials and its improvements were incorporated on the production line from the 101st I-200 . These were designated as the MiG-3 on 9 December , although the first production MiG-3 was not completed until 20 December 1940 . = = = Additional testing = = = The I-200 prototypes were used to evaluate a number of proposals . For example , the second prototype was fitted with a prototype of the AM-37 engine and first flew with that engine on 6 January 1941 . It experienced severe vibration problems and , despite efforts to cure the problems , failed during a flight on 7 May , and was destroyed in the ensuing crash . The third prototype was generally used for armament trials , experimenting with 82 mm ( 3.2 in ) RS-82 rockets among other weapons . For another trial it was equipped with the experimental 23 mm ( 0.91 in ) MP-3 autocannon carried underneath the wings in external pods and redesignated as the IP-201 . The 12.7 mm UBS gun was removed for these tests and the space freed up was used to install an extra fuel tank . Initially the cannon had the low rate of fire of only 300 rounds per minute , but this was soon doubled and the gun was renamed as the MP-6 . Installation of the guns was difficult , despite the aircraft 's metal outer wing panels , and the wings deformed when the cannon were first mounted . It made its first , and only , flight on 1 December 1940 carrying two MP-6s and two 12.7 mm AP-12.7 machine guns , but a blocked fuel line caused a forced landing before the guns could be fired . But testing on a variety of other aircraft revealed very unsatisfactory performance by the guns and their development was canceled . The designers were arrested on 15 May 1941 and executed on 28 October 1941 . = = Operational history = = On 3 December 1940 the VVS ordered that the 41st Fighter Regiment ( istrebitel 'nyy aviatsionnyy polk ) , based at the Crimean town of Kacha , was to conduct the operational trials for the I-200 and that they were to be transferred to the 146th Fighter Regiment at Yevpatoria , also in the Crimea , for pilot training after the conclusion of the trials . By 22 February 1941 89 had been issued to regular fighter units , notably the 89th Fighter Regiment at Kaunas , Lithuania and the 41st Fighter Regiment at Bia\u0142ystok , Poland , both places under Soviet occupation since 1939 \u2013 40 . On 1 June 1941 they were spread out a bit more , with 31 in the Baltic Military District , 37 in the Western Special Military District , one in the Kiev Military District and eight in the Odessa Military District for a total of 77 on hand , of which only 55 were operational . An additional eight MiG-1s were assigned to the Soviet Navy . However , only four pilots were trained to handle either the MiG-1 or the MiG-3 . Little is known of the performance of the MiG-1 in combat as most were likely destroyed during the opening days of Operation Barbarossa . However , one was still in the inventory of the VVS as late as 1944 when it was recorded as withdrawn that year . = = Variants = = Izdeliye-61 : This was the internal OKB designation of the I-200 prototype .

During World War II , he joined the United States Navy , and served with the Manhattan Project . He worked with George Kistiakowsky on the design of the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon . He was involved in the investigation of the Port Chicago disaster , served with Project Alberta on Tinian , and was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage . After the war , Reynolds began a long academic career at Princeton University .

Reynolds , a trainmaster for the Pennsylvania Railroad , and his wife Laura , a secretary with the New Jersey Department of Geology . He attended Franklin Junior High School in Highland Park , New Jersey , until year 10 , and then New Brunswick High School . He received a bachelor 's degree in physics from Rutgers University in 1939 . He then entered Princeton University , where was awarded a master of science degree in 1942 . He earned his PhD in 1943 under the supervision of Walker Bleakney , writing his thesis \" Studies in the production , propagation , and interactions of shock waves \" . = = Manhattan Project = = World War II was raging at this time , and someone with a doctorate in such a topic area was highly sought after by the wartime Manhattan Project , but Reynolds turned down an offer to join it . An avid surf fisherman and sailor , he aspired to join the United States Navy . He attempted to enlist , but was turned down because he wore glasses . He then lobbied the Navy , which waived this requirement . He was then commissioned as an ensign in 1943 , and married Virginia Rendall , a librarian , while he waited for his first assignment . Instead of the seafaring assignment he hoped for , Reynolds was sent to the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky in the design of the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon . In April 1944 , Kistiakowsky named Reynolds as one of eleven men that he would like to have working for him at Los Alamos . Reynolds was one of the naval officers who was sent to investigate the Port Chicago disaster , in which an ammunition ship had blown up in the harbor . He was tasked with estimating the size of the explosion , based upon observations of the damage . His estimate was 1,550 tons of TNT ( 6,500 GJ ) \u00b1 50 tons of TNT ( 210 GJ ) tons . A bill of lading was subsequently found for 1,540 tons , confirming his estimate . Reynolds was one of several researchers who determined that an atomic bomb would do maximum damage if detonated in the air rather than at ground level . He later served with Project Alberta , the part of the Manhattan Project for operations in the field . He served on Tinian , where the worked with the X-Unit Section , which was responsible for the Fat Man bomb 's firing unit . He flew a number of practice missions , but not the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki . After the fighting ended , he was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage . = = Princeton = = After the war , Reynolds accepted an offer of an assistant professorship at Princeton University . He would spend the rest of his career there , being promoted to associate professor in 1951 , and then to professor in 1959 . John Archibald Wheeler interested him in cosmic rays . Reybolds was director of the Princeton 's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 to 1970 . He initially recruited Ronald Rau from Caltech and Joseph Ballam from the University of California . Ballam eventually became a professor and division head at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , while Rau went on to become Chairman of the Physics Department at the Brookhaven National Laboratory . Reynolds later hired Sam Treiman , Giorgio Salvini , Riccardo Giacconi , Val Fitch and Jim Cronin . His reputation for spotting and hiring talent was assured when Giacconi , Fitch and Cronin won Nobel Prizes . For his cosmic ray research , Reynolds attempted to grow large organic crystal scintillators to use as ionized particle detectors . Scintillators are luminescent materials that , when struck by an incoming particle , absorb its energy and scintillate \u2013 emit light . They are used in many areas of scientific research . He was frustrated by cracks in the crystals , and attempted to get around the problem by dissolving them in liquid . To the surprise of many , the liquid was just as effective as crystal scintillators . Today , liquid scintillators are in widespread use in nuclear , biological and medical research . He also developed automated X-ray detectors for collecting data on protein structures . Interest in environmental issues increased in the late 1960s , and in 1970 , Princeton established Princeton 's Center for Environmental Studies . Reynolds was appointed as its first director . Under his leadership , it investigated a number of unusual inter-disciplinary topics , such as energy conservation in buildings , indoor air quality , the relationship between nuclear power and nuclear weapons , and the decision-making process in environmental issues Although most of his career was at Princeton , he spent some time in England , where was a Churchill Fellow at Cambridge University in 1973 and 1974 . He was later a visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Oxford University , and a visiting professor at Oxford Research Unit of the Open University , from 1981 to 1982 , and a Royal Society Guest Research Fellow at Oxford University in 1985 . Reynolds became the Class of 1909 Professor of Physics in 1978 , and Professor Emeritus 1987 .

He represented England in chess both before and after World War II . He worked at Bletchley Park during World War II , and was head of \" Hut 6 \" , a section responsible for deciphering messages which had been encrypted using the German Enigma machine . He was one of four leading codebreakers at Bletchley to petition the then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill directly for more resources for their work . After the war he worked in the Treasury , and later administered the British honours system . In chess , he represented England in international tournaments , and lent his name to three opening variations . = = Early life and education = = Born in Hendon , London , Philip Stuart was the second of six children to a schoolteacher , Edward Leopold Milner-Barry , who died in 1917 , and his wife , Edith Mary . A talented chess player , he won the first British Boys ' Championship in 1923 . He was a pupil at Cheltenham College , and won a scholarship to Trinity College , Cambridge , where he obtained firsts in classics and moral sciences . He represented Cambridge in chess . At Cambridge , he befriended another chess player , C.H.O 'D . ( Hugh ) Alexander , and composed a number of chess puzzles . Between 1929 and 1938 he was a city stockbroker , although he was unhappy with the work . From 1938 , he was the chess correspondent for The Times , succeeded in 1945 by Harry Golombek . = = = Early chess contributions = = = He made his debut in international-class chess at the strong London 1932 tournament , which World Champion Alexander Alekhine won . Milner-Barry 's best results in international competition were achieved in three straight years at the Margate tournaments from 1937 \u2013 39 , and at Hastings 1938 . In all four events he finished just above the middle against strong fields , with performance ratings ( as calculated by Chessmetrics ) between 2538 and 2565 . This places him at a solid International Master standard , although he never received this title . He reached as high as No. 65 in the world between June and August 1941 , according to Chessmetrics , which ranks historical chess performances retrospectively , using modern algorithms . He represented England in chess , and played in the international Chess Olympiads of 1937 and 1939 . The latter tournament , held in Buenos Aires , Argentina , coincided with Britain 's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939 . Milner-Barry , with teammates who included Hugh Alexander ( at that time the British chess champion ) and Harry Golombek , abandoned the tournament unfinished , and returned to Britain . His full Olympiad results are listed later in the article . = = Bletchley Park = = Upon their return , all three soon joined the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC & CS ) at Bletchley Park . Milner-Barry was recruited by mathematician Gordon Welchman , who had been his contemporary at Trinity College ; in turn Milner-Barry recruited Hugh Alexander . Arriving in early 1940 , he joined Welchman 's \" Hut 6 \" section , whose task was to solve the Enigma cipher machine as used by the German Army and Air Force . In 1993 , Milner-Barry wrote that \" to this day I could not claim that I fully understood how the machine worked , let alone what was involved in the problems of breaking and reading the Enigma cipher \" . Nonetheless , with his knowledge of the German language , he made a study of the decrypts and found that they contained stereotyped patterns and forms of address that could be exploited as \" cribs \" \u2013 reliable guesses for the plain language message that matched a given piece of encrypted text . Finding reliable cribs was a critical task for Hut 6 , as Enigma was broken primarily with the aid of \" bombes \" , large electromechanical machines which automatically searched for parts of the correct settings . Bombes were reliant on a suitable crib in order to succeed . In autumn 1940 , Milner-Barry was put in charge of the \" Crib Room \" . He was billeted with Alexander , who was working in Hut 8 , the counterpart to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma . Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time . By October 1941 , he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman . At this time , Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma , and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed . This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8 , which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy . Together , Welchman , Milner-Barry , Turing and Alexander bypassed the chain of command and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , outlining their difficulties . It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person , on 21 October 1941 . The next day , Churchill responded , \" Action this day : Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done . \" Within a month their needs were being met . In autumn 1943 , Milner-Barry took over as head of Hut 6 , which by that time had grown to over 450 staff , Welchman having been appointed the Assistant Director of Mechanisation at Bletchley Park . He remained in charge until the end of the war , presiding over a number of technical challenges presented by the introduction of extra security devices to the German Enigma , including the Enigma Uhr and a rewireable \" reflector \" rotor . His entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that , \" although he increasingly felt that Hut 6 was on the verge of losing the ability to decode Enigma , it held on until the end of the war , and this was due in no small part to his gifted leadership . \" The official history of Hut 6 , written immediately after the end of World War II , comments on his early \" most vital technical achievement \" in finding cribs , and on his \" administrative and diplomatic talents \" in his later role as head of the section . = = After World War II = = Milner-Barry joined the Treasury in 1945 with the grade of Principal . In 1947 , he married Thelma Tennant Wells , with whom he had a son and two daughters . The same year , he was promoted to Assistant Secretary , and Under-secretary in 1954 . Apart from a stint in the Ministry of Health from 1958 \u2013 60 , he remained with the Treasury until 1966 , when , aged 60 , he had reached the normal retirement age for the civil service . He was persuaded instead to carry on as a ceremonial officer administering the honours system . In this role , he supported the knighthoods of P. G. Wodehouse and No\u00ebl Coward . Milner-Barry eventually retired in 1977 . He was appointed OBE in 1946 for his work in World War II , CB in 1962 , and KCVO in 1975 . = = Later chess contributions = = He had also continued to play chess , competing in the 1952 and 1956 Olympiads . This 1956 Olympiad trip to Moscow was risky , since Britain and the USSR , which had been allies during World War II , were by then locked into the Cold War , and Milner-Barry 's wartime codebreaking knowledge would have been of great interest to the Soviets ; the very fact that Britain had broken German codes on a massive scale was kept secret until 1974 , when Frederick Winterbotham 's book The Ultra Secret was published . He placed second in the British Chess Championship at Hastings 1953 ( finishing behind only Daniel Yanofsky ) , with a score of 8 / 11 ; this would be his best result in British Championships . He was president of the British Chess Federation between 1970 and 1973 , competed in the British Championship as late as 1978 , and was still competing in club and county-level tournaments and matches into his 80s . His obituary in The Independent recalled his \" savagely effective attacking style , honed to perfection through a series of ' serious friendly games ' against his old rival Hugh Alexander \" . In 1972 , George Koltanowski wrote that , \" his style was very pleasing to spectators because he was always looking for dangerous continuations and quite often he found them ! \" His name is associated with three chess opening variations : Milner-Barry Variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defence ( ECO E33 ) : 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2 Nc6 Milner-Barry Gambit in the French Defence ( ECO C02 ) : 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Qb6 6.Bd3 cxd4 7.cxd4 Bd7 8.0-0 ! ?

In 1992 , echoing his wartime visit to 10 Downing Street , Milner-Barry was a member of a party who delivered a petition to the Prime Minister calling on the government to help preserve Bletchley Park , which was then under threat from demolition . He died on 25 March 1995 in Lewisham Hospital , London . A memorial service was held for him at Westminster Abbey on 15 June .",

                    "text": "Irfan Pathan = Irfan Khan Pathan ( pronunciation ; born 27 October 1984 ) is an Indian cricketer who made his debut for India in the 2003 / 04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy , and was a core member of the national team until a decline in form set in during 2006 , forcing him out of the team . Since then , he has been in and out of the limited-overs teams ( ODIs and T20Is ) , and has only sporadic appearances in Test cricket . Pathan played his last Test in April , 2008 at the age of 24 . Beginning his career as a fast-medium swing and seam bowler , Pathan broke into the national team soon after turning 19 , and evoked comparisons with Pakistan 's Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious swing . He cemented his position in the team and was named by the International Cricket Council as the 2004 Emerging Player of the Year . Pathan was instrumental in India 's One-day international and Test series wins in Pakistan in 2004 . He was described by the media as the \" blue-eyed boy \" of the Indian cricket . In late-2004 he took 18 wickets in two Tests against Bangladesh , but the start of 2005 he performed poorly and conceded runs at a high rate , leading to a brief exile from the one-day international ( ODI ) team . Immediately thereafter , Australian Greg Chappell , one of the leading batsmen of his time , became India 's coach ( 2005 ) and identified Pathan 's batting potential . Pathan improved his batting skills and tried to become a complete bowling all-rounder , and he opened the batting on occasions in ODIs and scored 93 in a Test match ( 10 Dec 2005 , versus Sri Lanka in Delhi ) in the role after an illness to Virender Sehwag . He made three scores beyond 80 in the space of four Test innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan . For the first nine months of Chappell 's stint at the helm , Pathan performed strongly with both bat and ball , scoring runs regularly and frequently taking top-order wickets . He rose to No. 2 in the ICC 's ODI rankings for all-rounders and was also in the top five in the Test rankings . This led critics to compare him to former Indian pace bowling allrounder Kapil Dev . In early 2006 , Pathan became the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick in the first over of the match ( vs Pakistan at Karachi ) . However , the productive run did not last and after the start of 2006 , Pathan began to steadily lose pace and swing , and his wicket-taking dwindled . Although Pathan 's batting continued to be productive , he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006 , and by 2007 was no longer in the squad . He returned to international cricket in September 2007 for the inaugural World Twenty20 , where he took three wickets and was man of the match as India beat Pakistan in the final . This earned him a recall into the ODI team , where he was a regular for most of the next 12 months before being dropped as his economy rate continued to trend upwards and subsequently struggled with a loss of form and injuries . In late-2007 Pathan was also recalled into the Test team after 19 months and hit his maiden Test century , but could not maintain his place in the team as his bowling was not effective enough with only two pacemen needed . Pathan played his last Test for India in April 2008 against South Africa . He continued to perform with both bat and ball at the domestic level , although his sedate pace is frequently criticized as being irrelevant at the international level . However , he impressed during the 2011 \u2013 12 Ranji Trophy , where he was the leading wicket-taker , and his performances earned him a recall to the national side again . Irfan Pathan , along with players such as Vinod Kambli and Laxman Sivaramakrishnan , was included in the list of \" India 's lost boys \" by Shashi Tharoor . = = Early years = = Pathan was born 27 October 1984 in Baroda , Gujarat , India and is of Pashtun ( Pathan ) ancestry , belonging to the Pathan community in Gujarat . He grew up with his elder brother Yusuf in a mosque in Vadodara , in an impoverished family . His father served as the muezzin . Although their parents wished them to become Islamic scholars , Pathan and his brother took an interest in cricket . Their games on the grounds off and inside the mosque often necessitated apologies from their father to Muslim worshippers who visited it . In the beginning his deliveries did not reach the other end of the cricket pitch , but rigorous six-hour training sessions in blazing heat and his family 's sense of discipline saw him progress steadily . Under the guidance of former Indian captain Datta Gaekwad , Pathan rose to get selected in the Under-14 Baroda cricket team , and when he was selected at Under-15 level to represent Baroda in a national tournament , he was finally presented with a full set of cricket equipment , having before been restricted to second-hand gear due to his family 's limited economic means . In December 1997 , Pathan broke into the Baroda Under-16 team , less than two months after turning 13 . He took a total of 1 / 35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped immediately afterwards . He did not play again for the Under-16s for two years , and in November 1999 , less than a month after turning 15 , he made his next appearance , this time for Baroda Under-19s against Maharashtra . He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3 / 41 in a victory , but was immediately dropped back to the Under-16s for the next match , and spent the rest of the 1999 \u2013 2000 season there . He bowled short spells in the younger division , taking four wickets at 38.00 in six matches , averaging less than seven overs an innings . He had more success with the bat , scoring 253 runs at 31.62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai . Pathan was then selected for the India Under-15 team in mid-2000 to play a series of matches against their colleagues from other countries . He took 15 wickets at 12.66 in ten matches , including a best of 3 / 2 against Thailand , and scored 15 runs at 7.50 . India won all but one of the matches , most by enormous margins . At the start of the 2000 \u2013 01 season , Pathan was immediately back in the Under-19s , this time bowling more , often delivering more than 20 overs per innings . In four matches , he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not out , and took 10 wickets at 32.50 . He was then promoted to the Under-22s , where he scored 44 and took 4 / 71 in his first match against Saurashtra , prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team . = = Senior beginnings = = He started against Bengal in March 2001 , after fellow left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan was selected for the national team . He scored 13 not out and 2 , and took 3 / 40 and 2 / 68 in a 222-run win . However , he was unable to repeat this form in the three remaining matches , taking only two more wickets in total , but Baroda nevertheless managed to win the Ranji Trophy . He ended his maiden season with seven wickets at 43.28 and 75 runs at 12.50 with a best score of 40 not out against Orissa . The Ranji win saw Baroda qualify for the following season 's Irani Trophy where they took on the Rest of India . Pathan scored 32 in the second innings and took 3 / 95 and 1 / 34 in a defeat , but his performance reminded Test batsman V. V. S. Laxman of Zaheer . However , he was omitted from the senior team and sent back to the Under-19s the next week and stayed there for the next two months , playing eight double-innings matches for Baroda . He took 20 wickets at 20.40 , including a best of 6 / 41 against Gujarat , and scoring 190 runs at 31.66 with a best of 63 not out . Pathan was then recalled to the senior team and made his List A debut against Mumbai , taking 1 / 69 from nine overs . Pathan further honed his bowling at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai , after being referred by Indian selector Kiran More . In early-2002 , he was selected for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand , where he took six wickets at 27.50 and scored 30 runs at 15.00 , taking 2 / 18 in a win over South Africa . Upon returning to India , Pathan was selected in a senior zonal team for the first time . He was selected for West Zone for the Duleep Trophy , even though he had not played a single match for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy season . He immediately repaid the selectors ' faith by taking 4 / 74 and 6 / 72 , his first ten-wicket match haul , in the first fixture against Central Zone , setting up a 161-run win . In the next match , he took 4 / 72 and 3 / 85 as West defeated North by 178 runs . He only took 1 / 55 in the next match against South but West were through to the final , where he took 4 / 43 to help cut down East Zone for 162 in the first innings , sealing the title . In all Pathan , had taken 22 wickets at 18.22 for the tournament , and scored 46 runs at 11.50 . These performances propelled Pathan into the India A team at the age of 17 and a half , for a tour of Sri Lanka , where he took six wickets at 35.00 in three first-class matches . Pathan then went on an India Under-19 tour of England in mid-2002 . He took 15 wickets at 25.93 in the three youth Tests , which India lost 1 \u2013 0 , with a best of 4 / 83 in the Second Test . He then took four wickets at 42.00 , conceding more than six runs an over , and scored 66 runs at 33.00 in the three youth ODIs , which India won 2 \u2013 1 . Pathan was rewarded with selection in the Rest of India team that played against Railways in the Irani Trophy at the start of the 2002 \u2013 03 season . He took a total of 2 / 84 and scored 29 as the Ranji champions prevailed . He struggled in the Ranji Trophy , taking 18 wickets at 39.33 in seven matches . Half of his wickets came in one match against Orissa in which he claimed 6 / 31 and 3 / 46 in an innings victory . He scored 161 runs at 23.00 , with a 54 against Tamil Nadu being his maiden first-class fifty , as well as two other forties . Despite a lack of wickets for Baroda , Pathan was selected for the Duleep Trophy , playing for Elite Group A. He took 5 / 88 and 4 / 106 against Plate Group A and 4 / 101 against Elite Group C , before taking 3 / 53 and 2 / 42 as Elite Group A defeated Elite Group B in the final by seven wickets . Pathan ended the tournament with 19 wickets at 27.00 and scored 72 runs at 24.00 . In the one-dayers , Pathan also struggled for Baroda , taking three wickets at 64.66 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.85 , but he was nevertheless selected for the zonal team , where he took four wickets at 34.25 in four matches at an economy rate of 3.91 . In 2003 he was selected for the India A team which travelled to England . Playing in five first-class matches , Pathan took nine wickets at 43.77 , including 4 / 60 against Yorkshire and 3 / 83 against South Africa . He managed only 8 runs at 4.00 with the bat . He had more success in the limited-overs matches , taking eight wickets at 11.12 in three matches , including a 4 / 19 against Lancashire , and scoring 27 runs at 27.00 . At the start of the 2003 \u2013 04 season , Pathan played in the domestic Challenger Trophy for the first time . Representing India A , he had little success , taking two wickets at 79.00 at an economy rate of 5.85 , and he did not force his way into India 's limited-overs team . He was then selected for India Emerging Players for a series of limited-overs matches against counterparts from Pakistan and Sri Lanka . Pathan took seven wickets at 11.00 in three matches , including 4 / 22 and 3 / 35 in two matches against Pakistan . In late 2003 , he was selected for the India Under-19 team to compete in an Asian youth ODI competition in Pakistan , where he was the leading bowler with 18 wickets at 7.38 , with an economy rate of 3.54 . This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket-taker . He was named as the player of the tournament , which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final . Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9 / 16 against Bangladesh , helping to bowl them out for 34 , and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final , taking 3 / 33 . Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat , compiling scores of 32 , 28 and 34 . Pathan returned to India and took 3 / 51 and 1 / 33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season , against Andhra Pradesh . This resulted in him being selected for the Indian national squad for the 2003 \u2013 04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia . = = Early international career ( 2003 \u2013 2005 ) = = Pathan made his Test debut in the Second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 2003 . At the age of 19 , he opened the bowling following an injury to the Baroda left-armer Zaheer Khan in the First Test . In a high scoring match , he took the wicket of Matthew Hayden while giving away 160 runs at almost five runs an over . He scored one in his only innings as India took a four-wicket victory . He was dropped for the following Test upon the return of Zaheer , but was recalled for the Fourth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Zaheer broke down in his only spell in the Third Test . On another flat pitch , Pathan took the wickets of Steve Waugh , Adam Gilchrist in the first innings in a spell of reverse swing bowling . He had Waugh caught behind from an outswinger and then bowled Gilchrist with an inswinging yorker . He ended with 2 / 80 in the first innings and dismissed Ricky Ponting in the second innings to end with match figures of 3 / 106 . In the ODI tri-nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed , Pathan was the leading wicket-taker with 16 wickets at an average of 31 in his maiden ODI series . After ending with 0 / 61 from ten overs on debut against Australia , he bounced back to take 3 / 64 and 3 / 51 in the next two matches against the World Cup holders . He earned his first international man of the match award in the tournament , after taking 4 / 24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI . However , his tour ended on a bad note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final . In that match , he took 2 / 75 as Australia amassed 5 / 359 and crushed India by 208 runs . Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151 . His batting improved towards the end of the tour with three scores of at least 19 in his last four innings , and he ended with 86 runs at 17.20 for the tournament . Pathan subsequently led the pace attack again on the 2004 Test tour to Pakistan , taking 12 wickets and bowling a higher proportion of maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India 's first series victory over Pakistan in two decades . In the first innings , he bowled 28 overs and took 4 / 100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead . After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on , Pathan tied the Pakistanis down , bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2 / 26 as India secured an innings win . Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order , helping India to recover to 287 . However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite Pathan bowling 44 overs to take 3 / 107 , and the hosts went on to complete a nine-wicket win . In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi , Pathan took 2 / 49 and 1 / 35 in an innings win . He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28.50 and 64 runs at 21.33 . He also continued his prolific wicket-taking in the ODIs , taking eight wickets at 17.87 at an economy rate of 4.76 in three matches , including three top-order wickets in the deciding fifth ODI in Lahore . He also scored 36 runs at 36.00 in the ODIs . His ability to swing the ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation that he could become an all rounder . In recognition of his performances at the start of his international career , Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004 . Pathan continued his productive form in ODIs at the 2004 Asian Cup in Sri Lanka , where he was the leading wicket-taker with 14 wickets at 16.28 at an economy rate of 4.37 in six matches , with three three-wicket hauls against the United Arab Emirates , Bangladesh and Pakistan respectively . He also scored 64 runs at 32.00 including a 38 in a defeat against Pakistan . He then struggled during an ODI tour in Europe , taking three wickets at 78.00 at an economy rate of 5.48 from five matches . India won only one of these games and lost four . Pathan returned to form during India 's brief campaign at the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England , where he claimed 5 wickets at an average of 9.00 and economy rate of 3.00 . He took 2 / 11 against Kenya and 3 / 34 against Pakistan , but defeat at the hands of the latter ended India 's campaign . Returning to India , Pathan then represented his country at the highest level for the first time on home soil . Pathan continued to improve his batting with a defiant 31 and 55 against Australia in October 2004 in the First Test in Bangalore . This was his first half-century in Tests , and was scored after the specialist batsmen had failed . Nevertheless , he managed a total of only 2 / 100 and India fell to a 217-run loss . Pathan 's career was put on hold after he suffered a side strain in the following Test in Chennai , in which he totalled 0 / 68 , causing him to miss the Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai . Australia went on to take the series 2 \u2013 1 and Pathan ended with two wickets at 84.00 and 100 runs at 33.33 . After being overlooked for the First Test with selectors opting for three spinners , he returned in the Second Test against South Africa in Kolkata , aggregating 3 / 89 and scoring 24 in an eight-wicket win that sealed a 1 \u2013 0 series win . Pathan made his name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh . Swinging the ball both ways , Pathan took 5 / 45 and 6 / 51 including several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory . He followed this with a match haul of 7 / 118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series . India swept the series , winning both matches by an innings . Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily , Pathan managed only five and four . He played in only one of the three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players , taking 1 / 45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win . In late 2004 , the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced central contracts for international players for the first time , and Pathan was given a B-grade contract . 2005 began rather poorly for Pathan . He took only six wickets at 68.33 in the home Test series against Pakistan after losing pace and accuracy . In the last two matches , he managed totals of 2 / 122 and 1 / 160 , conceding more than four runs an over as the Pakistani batsmen scored heavily . He scored 64 runs at 16.00 and made a duck in the second innings of the Third Test as the hosts collapsed on the last day to squander the series 1 \u2013 1 . He was subsequently dropped for the ODI series , playing in only one match in which he conceded 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs . However , he did manage to post his first ODI half-century , scoring 64 , defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213 , sealing a 106-run loss . Greg Chappell became the coach of the Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder . He started to hone Pathan 's batting skills , which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64 . Pathan was subsequently signed by Middlesex County Cricket Club for the English country season , where he attempted to regain his form after his bad start to the year . Pathan arrived in late-May and stayed for six weeks . He achieved better results than in the Pakistan series , taking six wickets at 24.66 and an economy rate of 5.41 in four one-dayers , including 3 / 42 against Essex . In the new Twenty20 format , Pathan took 12 wickets at 12.75 and an economy rate of 6.37 in seven matches , including a best of 4 / 27 against Essex . He scored 21 not out in the same match to help seal a 31-run win . However , his difficulties in first-class matches continued . He took 4 / 81 and 1 / 68 , and scored 41 and 13 not out in a productive debut against Sussex , and Middlesex were only one wicket away from victory when time ran out . However , he failed to take another wicket and ended with five wickets at 64.80 and 126 runs at 63.00 , scoring 68 against Surrey . = = Chappell era ( 2005 \u2013 2007 ) = = Pathan was recalled to the ODI team for the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August . This was Chappell 's first series as a coach , in which Pathan played in all five matches and took 6 wickets at 33.83 at an economy rate of 4.41 , but conceded 0 / 59 from nine overs as the hosts won the final . He scored 58 runs at 29.00 including an unbeaten 36 after India 's batting collapsed in a loss to the hosts in a preliminary match . He showed further signs of returning to peak form in the Videocon Triangular Series in Zimbabwe , taking 10 wickets at 16.10 at an economy rate of 5.03 and scored 60 runs at 30.00 in four matches . This included a haul of 3 / 34 and then a score of 50 as India collapsed to 164 all out and a 51-run loss to New Zealand . In another match , he took his ODI career best of 5 / 27 against Zimbabwe in Harare as the hosts fell for 65 . Despite his overall good form , Pathan was punished by the New Zealanders in the final , conceding 40 runs in five wicketless overs as India lost their second successive final . He was subsequently the leading wicket-taker as India took a 2 \u2013 0 clean sweep of an away Test series against Zimbabwe . In the First Test in Bulawayo , Pathan took 5 / 58 and 4 / 53 as well as scoring 52 in a man of the match performance to help India to an innings victory . He followed this with a 7 / 59 haul , his Test career best innings haul , and 5 / 67 in the final Test in Harare , his second ten-wicket match haul to set up a ten wicket victory , having also scored 32 in the first innings . He was again named man of the match , and his 21 wickets at 11.29 runs saw him named man of the series . This made him only the third bowler after Anil Kumble and Johnny Briggs to take 21 wickets in a two-match series . Upon the team 's return to India , Chappell experimented with Pathan by using him as an opening batsman in the Challenger Trophy prior to the late 2005 series against Sri Lankan cricket team . This yielded only moderate success with scores of 28 and 11 not out . Pathan took six wickets at 29.16 at an economy rate of 5.17 . Pathan was subsequently used at No. 3 in the batting line-up in the First ODI against Sri Lanka in Nagpur , where he scored 83 runs from 70 balls to help India post a total of 6 / 350 . Pathan also took 4 / 37 and 3 / 38 in the second and seventh matches at Mohali and Baroda respectively to win two-man of the match awards , taking ten wickets at 25.60 at ane economy rate of 5.22 for the whole series . He added a 35 in the final match and ended the series with 118 runs at 39.33 , playing akey role in India 's 6 \u2013 1 triumph . Pathan continued his strong ODI form with another man of the match performance of 3 / 23 and a knock of 37 runs against South Africa in the second ODI in Bangalore , having scored 46 in the middle-order in the first match after a top-order collapse . He ended the series with six wickets at 20.33 at an economy rate of 4.69 and 83 runs at 27.66 . After scoring two consecutive ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka , Pathan was elevated to opening in the second innings of the Second Test in Delhi , after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness . Having taken 3 / 34 from 22 overs in the first innings , Pathan scored 93 runs , building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436 . In the following match in Ahmedabad , he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall during the first half of the opening day . He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series , which India won 2 \u2013 0 . Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century . Following his strong performances in 2005 , Pathan was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India . Pathan had another difficult start to the new year in 2006 on the Test tour to Pakistan . In the first two Test matches played on flat surfaces in Lahore and Faisalabad , he had little success against the Pakistani batsmen , taking a total of two wickets while conceding 319 runs at more than four runs an over . After not getting an opportunity in the First Test \u2014 India lost only one wicket \u2014 Pathan made use of the good batting conditions himself and scored 90 in a double century partnership with wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Faisalabad . Pathan found success with the ball in the Third Test in Karachi , when on 29 January , he became the first person to claim a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match \u2014 the first five minutes of a match scheduled for 30 hours \u2014 and the first Indian to take a hat-trick in an away Test . It was also the highest in terms of total averages of the batsmen dismissed ( 130.18 : Salman Butt 34.27 , Younis Khan 46.04 , Mohammad Yousuf 49.86 ) and came after 1783 Tests in the history of cricket . He had Butt caught by Dravid in the slips from an outswinger , before trapping Younis leg before wicket and bowling Yousuf , both with inswingers . He finished with a haul of 5 / 61 after the hosts staged a lower-order counter-attack but was punished in the second innings , taking 1 wicket while conceding 106 runs as Pakistan set a target which was beyond India 's reach . Pathan ended the series with 134 runs at 44.66 and took eight wickets at 60.75 . Despite his Test travails , Pathan continued to perform strongly in the ODI arena , scoring 65 in the top order in the first ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar before making three consecutive three wicket hauls in the following matches . This included a man of the match performance that included a haul of 3 wickets for 43 runs at Rawalpindi as he claimed nine wickets at 18.88 at an economy rate of 4.49 for the series . Having taken an unassailable 3 \u2013 1 lead , India rested Pathan for the final match . Pathan had a quiet series against England following his return to India , taking 8 wickets at an average of 39.37 runs and scoring 121 runs at an average of 24.20 runs in three Tests . Pathan scored 52 in the first innings of the Second Test in Mohali , helping India to a first-innings lead and eventually a nine-wicket win . In the Third Test , Pathan managed only 1 / 84 in total and scored 26 and 6 as they collapsed on the final day and ceded their series lead . Again his ODI form was unaffected , taking eleven wickets at 15.63 in five matches , and scoring 123 runs at 41.00 with the bat as India easily claimed the series 5 \u2013 1 . Pathan scored 28 and then took 3 / 21 in a low-scoring 29-win in the first match , before scoring 36 and taking 4 / 51 in the third match in Goa . India then took an unassailable 4 \u2013 0 lead by winning the fourth match , in which Pathan took 1 / 27 before scoring 46 in the run-chase . = = International omission = = Pathan began to suffer a loss of form during the tour of the West Indies in May 2006 , when he managed only 24 runs at 6.00 and took 6 wickets at 29.83 at an economy rate of 5.59 while bowling in the ODI arena as India lost the series 4 \u2013 1 . After a poor display in a tour match , in which he was hit for 70 runs in 12 overs and appeared jaded , he was dropped from the Test team as V. R. V. Singh became the third place bowler and captain Rahul Dravid scrapped the five bowler strategy . Pathan only played once in the Second Test , after Sreesanth was sidelined due to injury . He scored 19 and took 1 / 43 and 1 / 50 as India enforced the follow on but the hosts hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand . India then selected two spinners in the last two Tests , and Pathan could not gain one of the two pace positions . Chappell stated that Pathan was fatigued and had been overworked but was confident that Pathan \" would recover from his slump and rise to further heights \" , asserting that he was still young and learning . Former India paceman Javagal Srinath expressed concern about Pathan 's dwindling pace , but expressed that swing was the first priority in backing Pathan 's return to international cricket . These concerns were further magnified in late 2006 , when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs in the first two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia . Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies , Pathan was dropped for the rest of the tournament . He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches . Pathan was then demoted from the position of an opening bowler in ODIs during the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy ; he took four wickets at 24.00 at an economy rate of 4.80 , and scored only 29 runs at 9.66 , as India were knocked out in the first round . Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late-2006 tour to South Africa . Playing in three of the five matches , he took a solitary wicket at 136.00 , conceding 7.15 runs per over , the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 as India were skittled for 163 in one match ; they were whitewashed by the hosts . Since the West Indies tour in May 2006 , Pathan had only been taking wickets at 41.33 . He subsequently fell out of the Top 10 of the ICC bowling rankings and the Top 5 of the All rounder rankings after having spent the previous year on the list . Despite this , Indian captain Rahul Dravid remained optimistic about Pathan 's prospects , stating \" The number of Man-of-the-Matches that Irfan has won is a testimony to the fact that he 's a proven matchwinner for us . He takes wickets early , contributes with the bat , is good in the field . \" Despite top scoring in both innings of a first-class warm-up match in Potchefstroom , scoring 111 not out and 40 not out whilst many specialist batsmen failed to cope with the bouncy conditions , he totalled only 1 / 49 from eight overs with the ball and was overlooked by the selectors for the First Test in Johannesburg . This indicated that although he had scored 560 runs at 35.00 under Chappell 's coaching , they saw bowling , which had been steadily declining , as his primary responsibility . After a poor bowling display in the subsequent tour match in which he conceded 74 runs in only 11 overs , Pathan became the first player to be sent home by the BCCI during a tour for poor performance rather than indiscipline . It was later revealed by Kiran More that it was a mutual agreement so that Pathan could play for Baroda in the final two rounds of Ranji Trophy in an attempt to regain form via match practice instead of watching the final two Tests from the sidelines . He subsequently led Baroda to the semi-finals after scoring 82 * to help defeat Uttar Pradesh by five wickets , but his bowling remained ineffective , returning figures of 2 / 108 and 1 / 59 , conceding 4.77 runs per over . Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar attributed Pathan 's situation to mismanagement , asserting that Pathan has been \" messed about \" as well as insinuating foul play . Pathan 's fortunes improved in the next two matches , totalling 5 / 92 and 7 / 96 against Tamil Nadu and Mumbai respectively . Pathan was initially dropped for the ODI series hosted by India against the West Indies , but was recalled for the final match in his home town after claiming seven wickets against Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi-final . His performance was regarded as lacklustre , taking 1 / 43 from seven overs . The selectors persisted and named him in the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , but injury stopped him from playing in the ODI series against Sri Lanka , denying him an opportunity to regain form . Pathan on his return took two wickets of the overs which he bowled.He had an impressive start as he took the wicket of Lendle Simons as a Leg Before Wicket . After taking 1 / 12 and 3 / 25 in warm-up matches against the Netherlands and the West Indies in the Caribbean , Pathan did not play a match at the World Cup , and was among a group of players to be dropped from the squad following India 's exit from the first round . He played no part in the tours of Bangladesh and England . Instead , he was sent on an India A tour of Africa . Two years after devastating the Zimbabwean batsmen , he played against a Zimbabwe Select XI , he took only six wickets at 30.16 in two matches , and then took eight wickets at 18.12 in two matches against Kenya . India won all four matches , and Pathan scored 87 runs at 21.75 . Pathan then took six wickets at 23.83 and scored 93 runs at 31.00 in four one-dayers . = = International comeback = = With India 's older players opting out of the inaugural World Twenty20 , Pathan was one of several younger players to regain national selection . India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides . In the first match , he scored 20 and took 2 / 20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round , before winning in a bowl-out . He then took 0 / 16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3 / 37 in a defeat of England . India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs , helping to restrict the hosts to 9 / 116 in pursuit of 154 . Pathan then took 2 / 44 , removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals . India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final . Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3 / 16 , including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls , before later bowling Yasir Arafat . As a result of his performances in South Africa , Pathan was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007 . He played in all 12 matches , seven against Australia and five against Pakistan . Pathan scored 131 runs at 18.71 in the lower-order and took 12 wickets at 46.00 at an economy rate of 5.02 , averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics . It was a steady performance ; Pathan never took more than two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4.60 and 6.66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan . With India opting to field two spinners and two pacemen on turning tracks in the home Test series against Pakistan in late 2007 , Pathan missed the first two Tests as Zaheer and Rudra Pratap Singh were the fast bowlers chosen . In the meantime , he took 11 wickets at 23.81 and scored 90 runs at 30.00 in two Ranji Trophy matches . Injury to both Zaheer and Singh in his colleagues resulted in his recall for the Third Test at Bangalore . Pathan scored his maiden Test century , reaching the mark with a six from leg spinner Danish Kaneria to move from 96 to 102 with only last man , paceman Ishant Sharma left to accompany him , before holing out in the same over . He made 21 not out in the second innings but was unpenetrative with the ball , taking a total of 1 / 110 as the tourists hung on for a draw . Pathan gained selection for the 2007 \u2013 08 tour of Australia , but did not play in the first two Tests with only two pacemen chosen . Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant , who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test . With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth , Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh . He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively . His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day . After entering at the fall of the first wicket , he batted for more than two hours and was the sixth man to fall . Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball , taking 2 / 63 and 3 / 54 , including both Australian openers in each innings , having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored . He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw . India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award . After his batting displays in Perth , Pathan was promoted to open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide , replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five-bowler attack . In a high-scoring match , Pathan took 3 / 112 , but he struggled with the responsibility of opening , scoring nine and a duck . In a high-scoring match , he took 3 / 112 in Australia 's 563.Following the Test series , he top-scored with 26 as India were skittles for 74 in the one-off T20 international . Pathan held his place in the ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy , scoring 118 runs at 19.66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34.27 at an economy rate of 5.49 . His best performance was a 4 / 41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50-run loss . His top-score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run-chase against Sri Lanka . Pathan struggled in the two finals against Australia , taking three wickets at 39.00 at an economy rate of 7.46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2 \u2013 0 win . An extra bowler backfired as the batsmen struggled . Pathan top-scored with 21 * in India 's first innings of 76 on the first morning and was again unbeaten in the second innings with 43 . However , he failed to take a wicket and conceded 85 runs in only 21.2 overs in an innings defeat , and was omitted from the next Test . After the South Africa series , Pathan participated in the 2008 Indian Premier League , having been purchased by the Kings XI Punjab . He took 15 wickets at 23.33 at the economy rate of 6.60 runs per over . His most effective performance came when he added an unbeaten 24 and took 2 / 18 from his four overs to help Punjab to a nine-run win over the Kolkata Knight Riders . He scored 131 runs at 21.83 and added 40 in a failed run-chase against Chennai Super Kings . = = Back on the fringes = = Following the IPL , Pathan resumed international duties in the Kitply Cup and the 2008 Asia Cup . He had an unproductive time with the ball ; although he scored a total of 86 runs at 28.66 , he took seven wickets at 51.42 at an economy rate of 6.56 . Pathan was overlooked for the Tests in Sri Lanka but was called into the team for the one-dayers , but played in only three of the five fixtures . He took three wickets at 34.66 , conceding 5.20 runs an over , and struggled with the bat , scoring 19 runs at 6.33 as the Indian batting collapsed in each match . He was then included in an India A team for a series of matches against touring counterparts from New Zealand and Australia . He had average results , taking four wickets at 43.75 and an economy rate of 4.86 , and scored 56 runs at 18.66 in four games . He did better the Challenger Trophy , taking six wickets at 14.00 at an economy rate of 3.42 , and scored 71 runs at 35.50 as India Blue won all three matches . At the start of the first-class season , Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1 / 91 for the Board President 's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series , and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen . He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy . He played in four matches and performed strongly , taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20 . He started the season with 6 / 85 and 1 / 34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh , and then took 4 / 42 and 1 / 46 against Railways . He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra . Pathan took 5 / 64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead . After taking 1 / 61 in the second innings , he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand . In his final Ranji fixture for the season , he took 7 / 35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77 , setting up an innings win . However , with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy , Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England . Pathan 's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty . Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs , he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4 \u2013 0 series lead . He took 0 / 57 from ten overs in the fifth match , as India recorded another victory , but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled . Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka , but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3 \u2013 0 lead . He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches , but was again expensive , conceding 7.06 runs an over . However , he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand that saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry ; Irfan ended on 33 not out . Pathan returned to India and took 3 / 50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season , which ended in a win , before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand . Pathan had a poor time in New Zealand . In the two T20 internationals preceding the ODIs , he took 0 / 38 and 2 / 41 , conceding his runs at an alarming economy rate of 11.28 . He was left out of all five ODIs during the tour before heading home . He then played in all 14 of Punjab 's round-robin matches in the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa , taking 17 wickets at 22.94 with an economy rate of 7.74 , and scored 196 runs at 19.60 . He started strongly , taking nine wickets in four matches in the early stages of the tournament , before taking only two in the next five matches , and ending with six in the last three fixtures . Punjab failed to make the semi-finals . Pathan 's performances in the IPL were enough for him to retain his position in the national T20 team after his performances in New Zealand , and he then proceeded to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June , where India were seeking to defend their title . He struggled in the warm-up matches , totalling 1 / 49 in five overs , and again in the first round of matches , bowling five overs and conceding 42 runs without success . Nevertheless , India defeated both Bangladesh and Ireland to move into the next round . He took 1 / 9 from two overs in the loss to the West Indies in the Super 8 round , and was left out for the remaining two matches , which India lost to be eliminated . Since then , Pathan was dropped from the limited overs team and was then injured for an extended period , until he made his return to cricket in the Ranji Trophy in November . He played in six matches for Baroda as captain and was successful with both bat and ball , scoring 397 runs at 49.62 and taking 22 wickets at 18.54 . In his most productive first-class season with the bat , Pathan made starts in eight of his nine innings , only failing to reach 24 once , and scoring four fifties , although he was unable to convert any to triple figures . In his fourth match of the season , Pathan top-scored in both innings with 68 and 81 as Baroda lost to Karnataka by an innings after making 153 and 223 . He then took a total of 7 / 76 and scored 65 not out to secure a seven-wicket win over Saurashtra , and then totalled 7 / 96 in a seven-wicket triumph over Maharashtra . However , these performances were not enough to earn Pathan a Test recall . Furthermore , on 25 February 2010 the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced its list of 30 probables for the T20 World Cup to be held in the West Indies , the most notable omission being Irfan Pathan . Pathan took 5 / 100 in the first innings of the Duleep Trophy final against South Zone . His fifth wicket brought up his 300th scalp at first-class level . After cricket was engulfed in a series of corruption scandals in September 2010 , Pathan told the media that he had received \" three expensive gifts in his room \" and , later , two further gifts that he could not afford . Pathan reported this to the team management as he thought the gifts might be from a bookmaker . = = Comeback to the national side and knee injury = = Irfan Pathan was recalled for India 's ODI squad for last two matches of five match one-day series against West Indies in December 2011 , and played in last match of the series , picking the wicket of first ball . He was selected for the Commonwealth Bank Series , playing four games and scoring 96 runs at an average of 24 with a top score of 47 . He also succeeded in taking 6 wickets at an average of 31.16 ; his best figures were 3 / 16 . His strong performances led to his inclusion in the Asia Cup squad . He played three matches and did not get a chance to bat but he proved himself with the ball taking 4 / 32 in the first match of the series against Sri Lanka . He picked up two more wickets in the next two games . He was the part of the team touring South Africa for the one T20 played on 31 March 2012 where he had figures of 4 \u2013 0 \u2013 44 \u2013 1 but was yet to bat . Pathan also played for the Delhi Daredevils the Indian Premier League in 2012 , taking only 8 wickets from 17 matches with an average of 58.12 . BCCI announced on 13 July 2012 inclusion of Irfan Pathan in the Indian team for the tour of Sri Lanka as a replacement to the injured Vinay Kumar . With his all round performance , India managed to win four of the five ODIs and the lone T20 match in the next series in Sri Lanka . Pathan emerged as the top wicket taker with a 5-wicket haul . Irfan Pathan was a part of the Indian squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka . In the Ranji Trophy 2012 \u2013 13 opener against Karnataka , Pathan raised his First-class top-score to 121 with his 3rd domestic hundred . But , he injured his knee during match and only made comeback to cricket in March 2013 . In 2014 he was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad to play in the Indian Premier League . = = Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa = = Pathan became a contestant on the Colors TV popular dance show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa in the 8th season in 2015 .

Through his career in Bollywood films , he has become one of the most popular celebrities and one of the highest-paid actors in India . He is the recipient of several awards , including five Filmfare Awards . The son of actors Rishi and Neetu , and the grandson of actor-director Raj , Kapoor pursued film-making and method acting at the School of Visual Arts and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute , respectively . He subsequently assisted Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the film Black ( 2005 ) . Kapoor made his acting debut with Bhansali 's tragic romance Saawariya ( 2007 ) , a box office flop but notable for earning him his first Filmfare Award \u2014 Best Male Debut . He was awarded the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performances in three films of 2009 \u2014 the coming-of-age film Wake Up Sid , the comedy Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani , and the drama Rocket Singh : Salesman of the Year . Kapoor won two consecutive Best Actor awards at Filmfare for portraying a troubled musician in the drama Rockstar ( 2011 ) and a deaf-mute man in the comedy-drama Barfi ! ( 2012 ) . A starring role in the romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani ( 2013 ) , one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films , established him as a leading Bollywood actor . However , he followed it by starring in a series of films that under-performed at the box office , although his performance in the romantic drama Tamasha ( 2015 ) was praised . In addition to acting in films , Kapoor supports charities and causes . He is the co-founder of the production company Picture Shuru Productions , and is a co-owner of the Indian Super League football team Mumbai City FC . = = Early life and background = = Ranbir Kapoor was born on 28 September 1982 in Mumbai to Rishi and Neetu , both actors of the Hindi film industry . He is the great-grandson of Prithviraj and the grandson of actor-director Raj . His elder sister , Riddhima ( born 1980 ) , is an interior and fashion designer . The actresses Karisma and Kareena are his first cousins . Kapoor was educated at the Bombay Scottish School in Mahim . As a student , he found little interest in academics and would rank low among his peers . Kapoor has been vocal about how his parent 's troubled marriage affected him as a child : \" Sometimes the fights would get really bad . I would be sitting on the steps , my head between my knees , till five or six in the morning , waiting for them to stop \" . These experiences led to a \" reservoir of emotions building up inside [ him ] \" , which he said compelled him to develop an interest in film . In his early years , Kapoor was close to his mother , but had a dysfunctional relationship with his father . After completing his tenth standard examinations , he worked as an assistant director to his father on the film Aa Ab Laut Chalen ( 1999 ) , during which he developed a closer bond with him . After completing his pre-university education from the H.R. College of Commerce and Economics , Kapoor relocated to New York City to learn film-making at the School of Visual Arts , and subsequently pursued method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute . In film school , Kapoor directed and starred in two short films , entitled Passion to Love and India 1964 . The loneliness of living alone in New York City coupled with his experience in film school , which he described as \" useless \" , inspired him to pursue a career in Bollywood . Upon returning to Mumbai , Kapoor was hired as an assistant director to Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the 2005 film Black . He described the experience : \" I was getting beaten up , abused , doing everything from cleaning the floor to fixing the lights from 7 am to 4 am , but I was learning every day . \" He later remarked that his motive for working on Black was to get Bhansali to offer him an acting job . = = Career = = = = = Debut and initial success ( 2007 \u2013 10 ) = = = Following the release of Black , Bhansali cast Kapoor as the protagonist of his 2007 tragic romance Saawariya , alongside Sonam Kapoor and Rani Mukerji . The film tells the story of a tramp , played by him , who falls obsessively in love with a woman awaiting the return of her lover . In an interview with the news and entertainment portal Rediff.com , Kapoor stated that his character was written as a tribute to his grandfather 's iconic roles as a tramp . Saawariya was the first Indian film to be produced by a Hollywood studio ( Sony Pictures Entertainment ) , and was a highly anticipated release . However , film critics were disappointed with the picture with BBC 's Jaspreet Pandohar calling it a \" misfire on a massive scale \" . CNN-IBN 's Rajeev Masand considered it \" contrived and fake \" , but was impressed by Kapoor 's \" affable charm \" and wrote that \" he \u2019 s got that star quality to him which is so rare to find . \" At the box office , Saawariya failed to earn profits . However , at the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony , Kapoor was awarded a Best Male Debut trophy . Despite the commercial failure of Saawariya , Kapoor was contracted by Yash Raj Films for a primary role in the Siddharth Anand-directed romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno ( 2008 ) . The film was his first commercial success , in which his role was that of a womaniser who is romantically involved with three women , played by Bipasha Basu , Minissha Lamba , and Deepika Padukone , at different stages of his life . Rachel Saltz of The New York Times expressed mixed views on his performance , but predicted that his \" puppy-dog sweetness \" would \" serve him well as a Bollywood leading man \" . In 2009 , Kapoor had three film releases . In Dharma Productions 's Wake Up Sid , a coming of age film from director Ayan Mukerji , Kapoor portrayed Siddharth \" Sid \" Mehra , a rich , lazy teenager whose life undergoes a series of changes after interacting with an ambitious journalist ( played by Konkana Sen Sharma ) . When Mukerji narrated the then-untitled script of the film to him , Kapoor came up with the title himself . The media expressed doubt on the film 's financial prospect as it depicted a romantic relationship between a younger man and an older woman . It eventually emerged as a sleeper hit and garnered acclaim from the critics . Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama reviewed that Kapoor 's performance in the film proved that he was \" amongst the best in the business today \" . Kapoor next starred opposite Katrina Kaif in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani , a slapstick comedy from director Rajkumar Santoshi , that emerged as the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2009 . Film critic Gaurav Malani praised Kapoor 's flair for comedy , but criticised his \" over-excited husky baritone \" . Kapoor 's final release that year was the Shimit Amin-directed Rocket Singh : Salesman of the Year , a drama about a sardar who aspires to be a salesman . Film critic Mayank Shekhar praised the film and found Kapoor 's performance to be \" astonishingly sincere \" , but the film earned little at the box office . Kapoor later professed to being highly disappointed by the film 's commercial failure . At the 55th Filmfare Awards , Kapoor was awarded the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performances in all three of his 2009 releases , and he also received two Best Actor nominations at the ceremony for Wake Up Sid and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani . Prakash Jha 's big-budget ensemble political thriller Raajneeti was Kapoor 's first release of 2010 . The film , which starred Nana Patekar , Ajay Devgn , Arjun Rampal , Manoj Bajpayee , Katrina Kaif and Sarah Thompson in prominent roles , was inspired by the Indian epic The Mahabharata and Mario Puzo 's 1969 novel The Godfather . Kapoor 's role was of Samar Pratap ( based on the characters of Arjuna and Michael Corleone ) , the youngest heir of an Indian political dynasty , who is reluctantly drawn to politics after the assassination of his father . Kapoor described it as his first complex role and considered it a departure from the \" lover boy roles \" that he had previously played . Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India reviewed : \" The film finally belongs to Ranbir Kapoor who perfects the art of minimalism \u2014 and literally grows before your eyes \u2014 as the simmering volcano that cannot be held back , once it erupts . \" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times , however , was more critical of his performance which he considered \" stony rather than calculating \u2014 especially jarring compared to the histrionic turns around him \" . Indian trade journalists were apprehensive of Raajneeti recovering its \u20b9 600 million ( US $ 8.9 million ) investment . The film , however , proved to be a major commercial success with worldwide earnings of over \u20b9 1.43 billion ( US $ 21 million ) . Kapoor received a third Best Actor nomination at Filmfare for the film . Later that same year , Kapoor collaborated with Priyanka Chopra on Anand 's Anjaana Anjaani , a comedy-drama involving two strangers who vow to commit suicide on New Year 's Eve . The film was a moderate financial success , but garnered little praise from the critics . Rajeev Masand noted that Kapoor \" struggles with a badly-defined role \" and NDTV 's Anupama Chopra concluded : \" Ranbir tries hard to salvage the film , dropping his shirt several times but even his lovingly shot chest can \u2019 t save the film . \" = = = Critical acclaim ( 2011 \u2013 2013 ) = = = Following an item number in the children 's film Chillar Party ( 2011 ) , Kapoor took on the role of Janardhan \" Jordan \" Jakhar in Imtiaz Ali 's Rockstar , a drama that follows the journey of an aspiring musician from a humble background to international stardom .

Film critics were polarised on their view of the film , but were unanimous in their praise for Kapoor ; Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis was particularly impressed with the film and thought that Kapoor 's portrayal was one of \" Hindi cinema \u2019 s most accomplished performances by a lead actor \" . For the role , Kapoor won both the Best Actor and Best Actor ( Critics ) trophies at the 57th Filmfare Awards ceremony , along with Best Actor awards at Screen and IIFA . With a gross revenue of \u20b9 1.07 billion ( US $ 16 million ) , Rockstar was one of the top-grossing Hindi films of the year .

Directed by Anurag Basu , the film ( set in the 1970s ) tells the story of its titular protagonist ( a deaf and mute man , played by Kapoor ) who falls in love with a woman who is already engaged ( played by Ileana D 'Cruz ) and later , an autistic girl ( played by Priyanka Chopra ) . In preparation , Kapoor observed the work of actors Roberto Benigni , Charlie Chaplin , and his grandfather .

Ronnie Scheib of Variety praised Kapoor for successfully channeling Chaplin in \" tone and affect \" , and Raja Sen of Rediff.com wrote that \" he does very strongly indeed with this Chaplin-tribute role , bestowing his character with heart every step of the way \" . The film was submitted as India \u2019 s official entry for the 85th Academy Awards , and was screened at the Marrakech and Busan International Film Festivals . Kapoor won second consecutive Best Actor awards at the Filmfare , Screen , and IIFA Award ceremonies .

He was cast as Kabir \" Bunny \" Thapar , a commitment-phobic photographer , a character Kapoor found to be an extension of himself . His pairing with Padukone , after their highly publicised break-up , led to hype surrounding the film 's release . Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time with earnings of \u20b9 3.02 billion ( US $ 45 million ) , proving to be Kapoor 's third consecutive commercial success in three years and earned him another Best Actor nomination at Filmfare . Film critics found the film to be \" riddled with clich\u00e9s \" , but praised both Kapoor and Padukone , with Daily News and Analysis ' Tushar Joshi labelling their on-screen chemistry as \" unsurpassable \" . Kapoor 's second release of 2013 was the action-comedy film Besharam in which he played a petty thief , alongside Pallavi Sharda and his parents .

Kapoor portrayed an ambitious boxer in the 1960s who is drawn towards a life of crime ; he based his tapori diction on Johnny Walker 's character in Mr. & Mrs. ' 55 ( 1955 ) . Made on a budget of \u20b9 1.2 billion ( US $ 18 million ) , the film opened to meager box-office collections and mixed reviews from critics . Ritika Bhatia of Business Standard found Kapoor 's part to be a departure from his previous roles , writing that he \" does test the waters with methodical sincerity but his portrayal lacks depth on occasion \" . Bombay Velvet was eventually screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals . Kapoor next reunited with Deepika Padukone to film Tamasha ( 2015 ) , a romantic drama from Imtiaz Ali . He played the role of Ved Sahni , a man who desires a career in the arts but settles for a life of monotony as an engineer . As with his previous three releases , the film failed commercially and received mixed reviews from critics . Kapoor 's performance , however , was praised ; Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote , \" Kapoor is beautifully cast , his trademark mix of assertive theatricality and subtle emotion well suited to the role of a man who seemingly has it all under control , until he doesn \u2019 t . \" The film earned him a Best Actor nomination at Filmfare . = = = = Upcoming projects = = = = As of July 2016 , Kapoor has launched a production company named Picture Shuru Productions in a collaboration with director Anurag Basu ; their first production \u2014 the comedy-mystery film Jagga Jasoos \u2014 will feature Kapoor ( alongside Katrina Kaif ) in the role of a teenage detective .

It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting . \" In another interview he added , \" It was exciting to work for him [ Lee Strasberg ] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people . One would just want to hear him talk , because things he would say , you 'd never heard before ... He had such a great understanding ... he loved actors so much . \" Pacino is currently co-president , along with Ellen Burstyn and Harvey Keitel , of the Actors Studio . = = Stage career = = In 1967 , Pacino spent a season at the Charles Playhouse in Boston , performing in Clifford Odets ' Awake and Sing !

Although several established actors \u2014 including Jack Nicholson , Robert Redford , Warren Beatty , and little-known Robert De Niro \u2014 also tried out for the part , Coppola selected the relatively unknown Pacino , to the dismay of studio executives . Pacino 's performance earned him an Academy Award nomination , and offered a prime example of his early acting style , described by Halliwell 's Film Guide as \" intense \" and \" tightly clenched \" .

He mounted workshop productions of Crystal Clear , National Anthems and other plays ; he appeared in Julius Caesar in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp 's New York Shakespeare Festival . Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film : \" I remember back when everything was happening , ' 74 , ' 75 , doing The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui on stage and reading that the reason I 'd gone back to the stage was that my movie career was waning ! That 's been the kind of ethos , the way in which theater 's perceived , unfortunately . \" Pacino returned to film in 1989 's Sea of Love , when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper .

The film stars Sachin Khedekar , Priya Bapat , Medha Manjrekar , Savita Malpekar and Ketaki Mategaonkar . Based on a short story by Usha Datar by the same name , the film depicts the tumultuous events in a Chitpavan Brahmin family , set around 1930 \u2013 1950 in Konkan . The film was a commercial success and got critical acclaim for its direction , screenplay by Girish Joshi and also for the performances by its actors , especially Khedekar for his portrayal of Hari Damle as a head of the family . In 1989 , the short story was adapted into a Marathi play Janmagaath with actor-director Vinay Apte playing the lead . Apte had desires to make a film based on it . However , his attempts were not successful . Sachin Khedekar , who went to play the lead in the cinematic adaptation of the story , had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007 . Khedekar requested Girish Joshi to complete the adapted screenplay and together approached Manjrekar in 2009 to make a film on the story . Kaksparsh 's shooting was completed in 26 days \u2013 from 5 to 30 December 2011 and was released on 4 May 2012 , on the occasion of centenary of Indian Cinema . The film won several awards on release including Best Film award at Maharashtra State Film Awards , MICTA , and 11th Pune International Film Festival . It is also the first Marathi film to have a home media release in Blu-ray . With the success of Kaksparsh , a Hindi and Tamil remake of Kaksparsh is also being directed by Mahesh Manjrekar with Arvind Swamy and Tisca Chopra as the leads . = = Plot = = Hari Damle ( Sachin Khedekar ) , head of a Chitpavan Bramhin family , lives in the village Torgaon in Konkan with his wife Tara ( Medha Manjrekar ) , their three children , his younger brother Mahadev ( Abhijit Kelkar ) , and his widowed aunt , Namu Aatya ( Savita Malpekar ) . Hari arranges the marriage of Mahadev with a pre-pubescent girl , Durga ( Ketaki Mategaonkar ) , renamed as Uma after marriage . However , Mahadev dies before the consummation of the marriage . Hari performs death rituals ( \u015ar\u0101ddha ) for Mahadev but crows ( symbolic of the spirit of the deceased in Hinduism ) refuse to touch the offerings . Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings . Brahmin community in the village now expects widow Uma to have her head shaved ( a ritual ) . Hari opposes and does not allow any rituals to be performed for her as a widow . Hari stands behind Uma in all her difficulties which raise doubts about his intentions , including that by his wife , Tara . Years later , when Tara is diagnosed of a terminal disease , the now grown-up Uma ( now played by Priya Bapat ) takes charge of the household . Before Tara dies , she realises her mistakes and requests Hari to marry Uma which he readily refuses . In the meantime , Hari gets his son Sankarshan ( Saksham Kulkarni ) married . Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside the room of the newly married couple , listening to their playful banter . Disgusted by Uma 's behaviour , Hari starts avoiding her . Upset by this behaviour , Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari 's friend Balwant ( Sanjay Khapre ) and requests him to find out the reason . Coincidentally , Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant . Unaware of the reason for Hari 's changed behaviour , Uma starts staying aloof , while her health starts degrading . Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti ( Manava Naik ) to talk to Uma . Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life , Uma opens her heart but situation raises more questions about her relation with Hari . Uma decides to go on a fast and relents to none of the family member 's request to quit . Hari , left with no other option , explains his behaviour . Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time , he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma . Thus , he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara 's request of their marriage . When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him , he stopped talking to her , in spite of his love towards Uma . He eventually accepts that he loves Uma and would marry her , breaking his vow . Knowing the truth , Uma forgives Hari and agrees to the proposal . Hari fetches Mangala sutra but finds out that Uma is dead . He realises that Uma has sacrificed her life for his love where she did not want Hari to break his vow . = = Cast = = = = Production = = = = = Development = = = Based on a short story Kaksparsh written by Usha Datar , a Marathi play Janmagaath premiered on 16 December 1989 . Actor-director Vinay Apte had done the role of Hari Damle in the play and Sukanya Kulkarni as Uma . Apte had tried making a film based on the story but was not successful . Sachin Khedekar had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007 . He showed the story to Girish Joshi ( screenplay writer of the film ) who then developed a complete adapted screenplay from the story which had a length of 4 \u2013 5 pages . Later , Khedekar and Joshi approached Mahesh Manjrekar in 2009 to make a film on the story . However , Majrekar was busy with his other projects and could not plan the film . Manjrekar said that when he heard the story for the first time , he considered it to be better than other Indian love stories like Bajirao-Mastani or Salim-Anarkali . Manjrekar had to wait as he did not have the copyrights for the story . He said that it \" took more than three years to make this film \" . = = = Casting = = = After Manjrekar finished his projects , he decided to start Kaksparsh and signed Khedekar to portray the lead role of Hari Damle . The director said that there was no compulsion for him to cast Khedekar . He did it \" because he was the best to pull it off . \" Earlier Manjrekar had signed another actress to play the role of Tara Damle , however the actress declined to join the schedule at the last moment , thus Manjrekar was forced to look out for the alternative . His wife , Medha Manjrekar , had done a small role in his debut film Aai ( 1995 ) and also made a comeback in another film De Dhakka ( 2008 ) written by him . As Medha was working as a producer for Kaksparsh , Mahesh Manjrekar approached her to play the role . Manjrekar had worked with Priya Bapat in Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy ( 2009 ) and had mentioned about Kaksparsh to her . He desired Bapat to play the lead role of Uma , however the film couldn 't start as planned . When Manjrekar planned for the film , he called Bapat again who got married to Umesh Kamat in the meantime . Manjrekar had seen 2011 National Award winning film Shala and was impressed with a teen-aged character played by Ketaki Mategaonkar and decided to cast her as a young Uma . Savita Malpekar was cast to play the role of Khedekar 's widowed aunt . Malpekar had to shave her head to prepare for the role . Manjrekar insisted that the film cast including Savita Malpekar should shave the head for their roles and avoid wearing a prosthetic bald patch . = = = Filming = = = Kaksparsh was shot in the real locations than sets and was mainly shot in Paalshet , a village near Guhagar in Konkan . As the film 's story-line was set around 1930 \u2013 1950 , Manjrekar was concerned about the authentic production design for the film . He appointed two production designers , Prashant Rane and Abhishek Vijaykar , who had challenges of depicting pre and post Indian independence era . Rane had worked with Manjrekar earlier for De Dhakka ( 2008 ) . Kaksparsh 's shooting was completed in 26 days ; starting from 5 December 2011 till 30 December 2011 . The initial shooting scheduled started at Ranade Wada in Pune . The film also had a few scenes in and surrounding the temple but as most of the temples in Konkan region have been restored from their damages over the period of time , Manjrekar feared that the plastering done to repair the damages would not give the desired authentic feel to the film . Thus , the next schedule was shifted to Krishna Ghat , Wai , Maharashtra . As a director , Manjrekar believed that the mansion shown in the film \" plays a major character \" and was certain that finding the appropriate mansion would be a difficult job . The production designing team had searched for various location across Konkan but most of the mansions had electrical wiring across which was a major obstacle for the shooting as Konkan then did not have electricity . Finally , Manjrekar was introduced to a mansion owned by Avinash Nene near Paalshet which suited the period where third and final schedule of the film was carried out . = = Soundtrack = = The soundtrack for the film is composed by Rahul Ranade and music director duo Ajit Parab and Sameer Mhatre , popularly known as Ajit-Sameer . Poet-Actor Kishor Kadam ( \" Saumitra \" ) and Mitali Joshi have written the lyrics for the songs . Being a period film set in 1930 , soundtrack mainly consists of traditional songs in the form of Ovee , a type of meterical stanza in Marathi poetry . Rahul Ranade used Vibhavari Joshi 's voice for all of his compositions except \" Janma Baicha \" . Joshi rendered all her songs without any musical accompaniment . As most of the songs are in the form of Ovee , Ranade decided to use the traditional musical format . He took help of Sarojini Babar , a Marathi writer-politician who had studied the songs of the period depicted in the film . Babar introduced Ranade to her sister , Kumud Pawar , who have made a collection of various traditional Ovee . For two situation songs , Ranade requested Kishor Kadam to write the lyrics . The duo Ajit-Sameer composed two theme tracks and one song ( \" Kuthe Paath Phiravun \" ) for the film 's soundtrack . A noted Hindustani classical vocalist , Rajashree Pathak , rendered the song and was appreciated for \" its vocal and soulfulness \" and won Best Playback Singer ( Female ) at 2012 Zee Gaurav Puraskar . Soundtrack also made use of \" Are Sansar Sansar \" , much-quoted couplet from one of the poems written by a noted Marathi poetess Bahinabai Chaudhari . The song is narrated and rendered by film 's lead actors , Sachin Khedekar and Ketaki Mategaonkar respectively and is arranged by Sameer Mhatre . Before taking up acting , Mategaonkar had participated in singing reality show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Marathi L 'il Champs . The soundtrack was released after the film 's release and was acclaimed for \" bringing an authentic and subtle flavour to the period of the film . \" Kishore Kadam was also appreciated for writing lyrics which suitably noted the traditions followed by women during the period . = = Reception = = Kaksparsh was released on 4 May 2012 which also marked a beginning of the 100th year of Indian cinema . The film received wide critical acclaim and was a commercial success . It got critical acclaim for the direction by Mahesh Manjrekar , its screenplay by Girish Joshi and for the performances by its actors , especially Sachin Khedekar for his portrayal of Hari Dada Damle as the head of the family . Ajit Reddy 's cinematography and Ajit-Sameer 's music were also praised . The film was said to have brought the \" best out of \" the director . Manjrekar said that he \" expected to it be a hit , but not expected such a landslide hit \" . The film was noted to have a \" strong script \" and well presented \" a sensitive issue . \" It was called as \" the best love story in Marathi films . \" It was marketed as a love story , and a review in Maharashtra Times by Saumitra Pote noted that \" the film has gone beyond a love story \" . The film also said to have shown \" the mores of the period quite accurately \" . Aniruddha Bhatkhande of weekly Marathi magazine Lokprabha criticised the film in his review by saying that the actual film is a way different than the \" attractive \" promos . He further said that the film 's costume designs are flawed and as most of the film is shot indoor , it gives a feeling to the viewers that they are watching a recorded theatre play . = = = Remake = = = With the success of Kaksparsh , it was reported in June 2012 that Manjrekar is planning a remake in Hindi starring Amitabh Bachchan . However , the director readily clarified that he is not planning for a remake and he did contact Bachchan for the film but not for the remake . Later in January 2014 , Manjrekar announced that a Hindi and Tamil remake of Kaksparsh is being directed by himself starring Arvind Swamy , Tisca Chopra , Adinath Kothare and Ketaki Mategaonkar . Swamy will be portraying Khedekar 's role whereas Chopra will be seen as Swamy 's wife , originally played by Medha Manjrekar .

After a week of shooting , the film was shelved due to the view that such a story might not succeed in Telugu ; the production company then produced Shanti , which became a failure . D. L. Narayana decided to revive the film after being encouraged by the success of Stri Sahasam . Janaki , who was originally chosen for the character of Parvati , opted out of the film as she could not spare the time ; she was then replaced by Savitri . Principal photography commenced with Nagaraja Rao , a still photographer shooting some stills of Nageswara Rao in the guise of Devadasu , with a glass in his hand and the looks of a drunkard . Rao also took shots of Savitri in Parvati 's make-up in Naarsu 's Studio . Impressed with these stills , Narayana decided to use the same make-up for the real shooting of the film . He showed these make-up stills to Mangaiah , the make-up man , who followed the same . Nageswara Rao , who portrayed the titular character , recalled that Vedantam , being a Kuchipudi dance exponent and an experienced stage actor , used to enact the scenes before the actors , thereby making their job easy . He even recalled that the character 's half asleep makeup was a result of hard work by the make-up man Mangaiah , and that the director shot him only at night so that he could get a \" natural \" feel to the hero 's drunken look ; those scenes were shot over 53 days . = = Music = = The official soundtracks of Devadas were composed by C.

Reviewing Devadasu , Randor Guy wrote that the film was remembered for \" empathetically brilliant performance of Nageswara Rao in the title role and equally impressive acting by Savithri \" . Cinegoer wrote , \" The superb direction by Sri Vedantham Raghavaiah made [ Devadasu ] an immortal classic \" .

The film proved to be a major breakthrough in Nageswara Rao 's career . The success of the film made him known as the \" Tragedy King \" of Telugu cinema and also led to his becoming typecast in similar roles . In order to shed the tragic-romantic hero image , he accepted a comic role in Missamma ( 1955 ) . Savitri too appeared in Missamma , and her character in that film was described by Pa . Dheenadhayalan of Dinamani as an antithesis of her role in Devadasu . In July 2007 , S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu asked eight Tamil directors to list ten of their favourite films . Balu Mahendra named Devadas as one of his top ten Tamil films . He added that the film had \" superb lighting by B. S. Ranga , excellent performances by A. Nageswara Rao and Savithri , and haunting music by C. R. Subbaraman \" . Actor Sivakumar stated , \" You can \u2019 t reproduce movies like Parasakthi , Pasamalar , Devadas , Veerapandiya Kattabomman or Ratha Kanneer [ ... ] By remaking such films , you are lowering yourself , while it enhances the original artists \u2019 image . \" YVS Chowdary titled his 2006 comedy film Devadasu , though it had no similarity with this film .

In April 2013 , CNN-News18 included the film in its list of \" 100 greatest Indian films of all time \" . Indo-Asian News Service described Devadasu as one of Nageswara Rao 's \" best films \" . Dilip Kumar , who portrayed Devadas in the 1955 film directed by Bimal Roy , admitted that Nageshwara Rao 's performance as the character was better than his own , remarking , \" There is only one Devadas ( 1953 ) , and that is Akkineni Nageswara Rao . \"",

Directed by Usmar Ismail for Perfini , the film follows three sisters who live with their father and grandmother . When the eldest sister , Nunung , shows no interest in marrying , her family tries unsuccessfully to find a husband for her . Nunung initially rejects the advances of a young man named Toto , who instead dates her younger sister . However , when he becomes jealous and travels from Jakarta to Bandung to profess his love , she agrees to marry him . Produced using government credit and written in an attempt to cover Perfini 's outstanding debts , Tiga Dara was intended to be commercial despite Ismail 's disapproval of such works . After it was released in August 1957 , the film was an immense popular success , launching the careers of its stars , earning the highest box office returns of any Perfini film , and being screened in first-class cinemas . However , even though Tiga Dara was shown at the 1959 Venice Film Festival and received Best Musical Arrangement at the 1960 Indonesian Film Week , Ismail considered it a compromise of his initial vision for Perfini . Since its release , Tiga Dara has been considered a classic of Indonesian cinema , with themes which remain relevant for modern Indonesian society . It was remade as Tiga Dara Mencari Cinta ( Three Maidens Seek Love ) in 1980 by Djun Saptohadi and influenced Teguh Karya 's Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta ( Lover Left by the Train , 1989 ) . A second remake , Ini Kisah Tiga Dara ( This is the Story of Three Maidens ) , has been produced by Nia Dinata and is scheduled for a September 2016 release . In 2015 Tiga Dara was restored and converted to 4K digital by L 'immagine Ritrovata Laboratory . = = Plot = = Three sisters \u2014 Nunung ( Chitra Dewi ) , Nana ( Mieke Wijaya ) and Nenny ( Indriati Iskak ) \u2014 are being raised by their grandmother ( Fifi Young ) in Jakarta after their mother 's death . Though the sisters ' father Sukandar ( Hassan Sanusi ) lives with them , he is too involved in his own work to pay them heed . While the sisters are out with Nana 's boyfriend Herman ( Bambang Irawan ) , their grandmother tells Sukandar than she will not live to see Nunung , already aged 29 , marry . He agrees to invite his colleagues to the house . When they come several days later , Nunung impresses all present with her piano-playing and singing . However , the men are all too old , and Nunung 's grandmother insists that Sukandar find a younger man . Nenny , overhearing the conversation , suggests that they hold a party ; this too is a failure , as Nunung takes no interest in the festivities . Nana is then asked to take Nunung out with her , in the hopes that the eldest sister will meet a marriageable young man . At a party , while Nana mingles with several men , Nunung sits out every dance and eventually leaves with Herman . Asked why she has returned home , Nunung tells her grandmother that she felt too old among the younger party-goers and asks why she was told to go . Nenny , again eavesdropping , shouts out that their grandmother is hoping to find her a husband . Though Nunung is initially angered , she understands her grandmother 's good intentions . The following day , Nunung is stricken by a scooter driven by Toto ( Rendra Karno ) . Despite an injured leg , Nunung insists on taking a pedicab home ; without her knowledge , Toto follows her . He later returns to apologize , and , though Nunung treats him harshly , is quickly accepted by Nana and her grandmother . Nana asks Toto to visit frequently , and over the next several days Nana pushes away Herman . Nenny , meanwhile , uses her sister 's interest in Toto to become closer to Herman . When Nana announces that she and Toto are engaged , her grandmother is furious ; if Nana marries before her sister , she says , Nunung will never marry . After Nana and Nunung fight , their guardians decide that it is best for Nunung to go the home of her uncle Tamsil ( Usmar Ismail ) in Bandung and rest . While there , Nunung writes a letter to her father that Joni kisses her goodnight every day . This news sparks Nenny 's titillation and Toto 's jealousy . Nana insists that Toto choose between her and Nunung ; Toto decides to go to Bandung and protest Joni 's impropriety . He confronts Nunung and confesses his love for her . She spitefully tells him that she sleeps with Joni every night . Herman , at the insistence of Nana , takes the remainder of the family to Bandung , where they meet up with Toto , Nunung , and Tamsil 's family . As Tamsil introduces his sons , Joni is revealed to be a young child . Nunung and Toto embrace , while Nana and Herman make up . = = Production = = Tiga Dara was directed and produced by Usmar Ismail for his National Film Company ( Perusahaan Film Nasional , better known as Perfini ) . Although Ismail had wanted to \" not consider commercial aspects \" of filmmaking when he established Perfini in 1950 , he was forced to recognise the need to make a profitable film as Perfini continued to lose money . Following the failures of Lagi-Lagi Krisis ( More Crises , 1955 ) and Tamu Agung ( Exalted Guest , 1955 ) , the company 's financial situation was bleak , and Ismail fired a number of his staff . With only some leftover government credit to finance his next production , Ismail collaborated with M. Alwi Dahlan to write a film which would be popular with audiences . The resulting story , which may have been inspired by the 1936 musical comedy Three Smart Girls , was Tiga Dara . Production of Tiga Dara began in 1956 . Chitra Dewi , Mieke Wijaya , and Indriati Iskak were cast as the titular maidens . Dewi had previously appeared in Tamu Agung , and Wijaya had made her debut in the Palembang Film Corporation 's Gagal ( Fail ) the previous year . Iskak , the 14-year-old daughter of film director Raden Iskak , made her feature film debut with Tiga Dara . Supporting roles were filled by Fifi Young , Rendra Karno , Hassan Sanusi , Bambang Irawan , and Roosilawaty . For the role of Joni , Ismail cast his real-life son , Irwan Usmar Ismail . As musical films were popular with Indonesian audiences , Tiga Dara was made in that genre . It featured seven songs by Sjaiful Bachri ( who also served as sound editor ) as well as one by Ismail Marzuki and two by Oetjin Noerhasjim . Only Wijaya provided her own vocals ; the other actors were dubbed by Sam Saimun , Elly Sri Kudus , Bing Slamet , Djuita , S. Effendy , and Sitti Nurochma . Long-time Perfini cameraman Max Tera handled cinematography for this black-and-white film , using the company 's outdated equipment , and Soemardjono was in charge of editing . = = Release and reception = = Tiga Dara premiered in August 1957 at the Capitol Theatre in Jakarta . Distributed by Perfini , it found popular success and was screened for eight consecutive weeks in cinemas throughout the archipelago . This included several first-class cinemas which were affiliated with the American Motion Picture Association of Indonesia ( AMPAI ) and mostly showed imported films . On 20 September 1957 President Sukarno arranged for a private screening of the film at the Presidential Palace in Bogor for the birthday of his wife , Hartini . \" Tiga Dara \" competitions between groups of three sisters were held in much of Java , and the term became widely used as the name of batik products , shops , and drinks . At the 1960 Indonesian Film Week , Tiga Dara received Best Musical Arrangement . Negotiations to bring Tiga Dara to Malaya began soon after its release , and the film was exported , again to commercial success , in exchange for the import of the Malayan film Mega Mendung ( Cloudy Skies ) . In the late 1950s the film was shown in several Italian cities , including Rome , as well as in Yugoslavia . After Floris Ammannati saw the Rome screening , he invited Ismail to show Tiga Dara at the 1959 Venice Film Festival ; Ismail did so , though he considered the Venice screening to be unsuccessful . Tiga Dara was screening in Netherlands New Guinea by August 1960 and in Suriname by August 1963 . = = Impact = = Tiga Dara was Perfini 's most lucrative film , grossing almost Rp 10 million in ticket sales , or a profit of Rp 3,080,000 , during its theatrical run . However , despite this popular success Perfini 's financial situation saw little improvement . Furthermore , Ismail considered the Tiga Dara a disappointment which compromised the goals he had had when he established Perfini . According to fellow Perfini film director D. Djajakusuma : Usmar [ Ismail ] was ashamed of the film . His intent to sell Tiga Dara when it was still in production showed how difficult it was for him to accept the fact that he had to make that kind of film . ... even though money was coming in , Perfini just was not making the kinds of films that Usmar had dreamed of initially . In subsequent years Perfini released a number of commercially oriented films , such as Delapan Pendjuru Angin ( Eight Compass Directions , 1957 ) and Asrama Dara ( Dormitory for Girls , 1958 ) . Though none of these were commercial failures , none except for Asrama Dara approached the financial success of Tiga Dara . Ismail attempted to reassert himself as a director of quality not-for-profit films through Pedjuang ( Warriors for Freedom , 1960 ) , which was screened in competition at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961 . However , as the years passed he became increasingly distanced from his early goals and had made attempts to enter banking , the nightclub industry , and parliament by the time of his death in 1971 . Dewi and Wijaya both became popular following the success of Tiga Dara . Dewi continued acting for a further four decades , appearing in her final feature film , Pedang Ulung ( Grand Sword ) , in 1993 , fifteen years before her death . Wijaya 's most recent film role has been in Ayat-Ayat Cinta ( Verses of Love , 2008 ) . Meanwhile , Iskak , who was praised for having a more naturalistic acting style than her stage-trained fellow actors , soared to popularity . She formed a girl group , the Baby Dolls , together with Rima Melati , Gaby Mambo , and Baby Huwae , and acted in a further eight films before retiring from cinema in 1963 . = = Legacy = = Tiga Dara has been recognised as a classic of Indonesian cinema and often been shown on television . A 1989 retrospective on Perfini in Tempo argued that the film still showed the sense of honesty and realism common in Ismail 's earlier work , and in a 1991 memorial book for Ismail , Rosihan Anwar wrote that the themes of Tiga Dara remained relevant for the Indonesian people . Similar sentiments were voiced by the film director Nia Dinata in 2016 . By 2015 the cellulose acetate negatives for Tiga Dara , held at Sinematek Indonesia , were heavily damaged . They were torn in places , and scenes were besmirched by fungus or lost altogether . To better preserve the film for future generations , SA Films arranged for Tiga Dara to be restored by the Bologna-based L 'immagine Ritrovata Laboratory ; the film was the second of Ismail 's oeuvre to be restored , following Lewat Djam Malam ( After the Curfew , 1954 ) in 2012 . Restoration work , which included the reinsertion of lost scenes using extant copies of the film and the removal of dust and fungus , began in early 2015 and was completed on 8 October 2015 . This restoration \u2014 converted to 4K digital \u2014 is to be screened in Indonesia beginning on 11 August 2016 , with a DVD and Blu-ray release the following year . Several films have been remade or influenced by Tiga Dara . A remake , Tiga Dara Mencari Cinta ( Three Maidens Seek Love ) , was directed by Djun Saptohadi and released in 1980 . This comedy starred Ingrid Fernandez , Nana Riwayatie , and Winny Aditya Dewi as three sisters who live with their father and face the trials and tribulations of dating . Eight years later , when Teguh Karya was directing Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta ( Lover Left by the Train , 1989 ) , he insisted that the cast and crew watch Tiga Dara in an attempt to transcend it . In Tempo , the writer Putu Wijaya later described Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta as seemingly trying to recapture the family and musical dynamics of Ismail 's story . In 2004 a remake of Tiga Dara , to be directed by Rudi Soedjarwo and involve Dian Sastrowardoyo , Siti Nurhaliza , and Krisdayanti , was announced , though this production has not been realized . Another updated retelling of the Tiga Dara story , Ini Kisah Tiga Dara ( This is the Story of Three Maidens ) , was shot between 23 February and 27 March 2016 in Maumere , Flores . In a press conference , the film 's director , Nia Dinata , stated that she had enjoyed watching Tiga Dara as a child and that she remained awed by the film 's beauty . She also said that her retelling , though it maintained the spirit of Ismail 's original , would feature a new plot as well as new songs by Titiek Puspa . Ini Kisah Tiga Dara , which stars Shanty , Tara Basro , and Tatyana Akman , is scheduled for a September 2016 release . = = Explanatory notes = =",

The son of actors Pankaj Kapur and Neelima Azeem , Kapoor was born in New Delhi . His parents separated when he was three , and he continued living with his mother . They moved to Mumbai when has was 10 , where he joined Shiamak Davar 's dance academy . Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in a few films of the 1990s , and was later featured in music videos and television commercials . Kapoor made his film debut in 2003 with a leading role in the romantic comedy Ishq Vishk , a sleeper hit for which he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut . He followed it with roles in several commercial failures before starring opposite Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya 's top-grossing family drama Vivah ( 2006 ) . Kapoor earned nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for portraying a troubled businessman in Imtiaz Ali 's romantic comedy Jab We Met ( 2007 ) and twin brothers in Vishal Bhardwaj 's caper thriller Kaminey ( 2009 ) .

In 2014 , Kapoor portrayed the Hamlet character in Bhardwaj 's acclaimed drama Haider , for which he won the Best Actor award at Filmfare , and in 2016 , he played a drug abusing singer in the crime drama Udta Punjab . Cited in the media as one of the most attractive Indian celebrities , Kapoor maintains his popularity despite a fluctuating career trajectory . Initially recognised for portraying romantic roles , Kapoor has since taken on parts in action films and thrillers . He is the recipient of several awards , including two Filmfare Awards . In addition to acting , Kapoor supports charities , hosts award ceremonies , and has featured as a talent judge on the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded ( 2015 ) . Following a romantic relationship with the actress Kareena Kapoor , he married Mira Rajput , a student from New Delhi , in 2015 . = = Early life = = Shahid Kapoor was born in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem . His parents divorced when he was three years old ; his father shifted to Mumbai ( and married the actress Supriya Pathak ) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents . His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik , and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather : \" He would walk me to school every single day . He would talk to me about dad , with whom he shared a great relationship , and read out his letters to me . \" His father , who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai , would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday . When Kapoor was 10 , his mother , who was working as a dancer , moved to Mumbai to work as an actress . In Mumbai , Azeem went on to marry the actor Rajesh Khattar . Kapoor continued living with his mother and Khattar , until they separated in 2001 . Kapoor continues to use the last name Khattar on his passport . He has a maternal half-brother from his mother 's marriage to Khattar . From his father 's marriage to Pathak , he has two paternal half-siblings . Kapoor was educated at the Gyan Bharati School in Delhi and Rajhans Vidyalaya in Mumbai . He later attended Mumbai 's Mithibai College for three years . Kapoor was interested in dance from an early age , and at the age of 15 , he joined Shiamak Davar 's dance institute . As a student there , Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in the films Dil To Pagal Hai ( 1997 ) and Taal ( 1999 ) , in which Davar served as choreographer . During a stage show at the institute , Kapoor performed in the songs \" Vogue \" and \" GoldenEye \" to a positive response from the audience ; he described the experience as the first time that he \" felt like a star \" . He later became an instructor at the institute . During this time , Kapoor accompanied a friend to an audition for a Pepsi commercial featuring the stars Shah Rukh Khan , Kajol and Rani Mukerji , but wound up with the part himself . He appeared in television commercials for the brands Kit Kat and Close-Up , among others , and featured in music videos for several performers , including the band Aryans and the singer Kumar Sanu . Kapoor also took on the job of an assistant director to his father on the 1998 television series Mohandas B.A.L.L.B. = = Acting career = = = = = Early work ( 2003 \u2013 05 ) = = = Having noticed Kapoor in the Aryans ' music video \" Aankhon Mein \" , the producer Ramesh Taurani was keen to cast him in a film . However , upon meeting him , Taurani thought Kapoor , who was 20 years old at the time , to be too young and underweight to become an actor , and encouraged him to wait for a few years . Kapoor , meanwhile , turned down a lead role in N. Chandra 's sex comedy Style in hopes of working with Taurani . Taurani found a suitable project for Kapoor in the teenage romance Ishq Vishk ( 2003 ) , which Ken Ghosh was directing for his company . Kapoor , who trained extensively for a bulkier physical build , was eventually hired . Before beginning work on the film , he attended acting workshops with Naseeruddin Shah and Satyadev Dubey . Ishq Vishk tells the story of Rajiv Mathur ( Kapoor ) , a high-school student who engages in a romantic affair with two classmates of contrasting personalities ( played by Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasurywala ) . Kapoor was attracted to the idea of playing an unlikable lead since it was a departure from the traditional portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian films . Writing for The Hindu , the critic Ziya Us Salam did not find him to be \" hero material \" , adding that \" boyhood seems to have overstayed on his face \u2013 but he is not necessarily bad in the acting department . \" The film , however , proved to be a sleeper hit at the box office and won Kapoor the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut . Following his debut , Kapoor reunited with Ghosh in a film he considered to be drastically different from Ishq Vishk . The thriller Fida ( 2004 ) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman ( Kareena Kapoor ) and her lover ( Fardeen Khan ) to rob a bank . Despite criticising the film , Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote that Kapoor \" shines in his role . He looks fresh . As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy , who is sucked into crime because of these very qualities , he manages to evoke your sympathies . \" Later that year , Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Dil Maange More in which he was paired opposite three women : Soha Ali Khan , Tulip Joshi , and Ayesha Takia . Patcy N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan 's acting style . Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful . The series of poorly received films continued in 2005 , when all three of Kapoor 's films failed at the box office . His first two releases that year were the comedies Deewane Huye Paagal and Vaah ! Life Ho Toh Aisi ! , both of which were largely panned . The former was plagiarised from the Hollywood film There 's Something About Mary in which Kapoor played one of Rimi Sen 's love interests ; the critic Khalid Mohamed found Kapoor to be \" the only likeable element in this travesty \" but Namrata Joshi of Outlook labelled him \" colourless \" and criticised his pairing with Sen. His final role was that of a righteous teenager drawn towards a life of indulgence in John Matthew Matthan 's drama Shikhar , co-starring Ajay Devgan , Bipasha Basu and Amrita Rao . The critic Sukanya Verma found Kapoor to be miscast as a village boy in the film , but noted that he was \" never short of spontaneity and youthful exuberance \" . = = = Breakthrough ( 2006 \u2013 09 ) = = = In 2006 , Kapoor played opposite Kareena Kapoor in two films \u2014 the thriller 36 China Town and the comedy Chup Chup Ke . In 36 China Town , a murder mystery from the director duo Abbas \u2013 Mustan , Kapoor starred as one of the seven suspects in the murder of an heiress , and in the Priyadarshan-directed Chup Chup Ke , he played a depressed man who pretends to be deaf and mute . The former was his first commercial success since Ishq Vishk . Greater success came to Kapoor later that year when he starred alongside Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya 's romantic drama Vivah , a film depicting an arranged marriage . Made on a shoestring budget of \u20b9 100 million ( US $ 1.5 million ) , the film earned over \u20b9 530 million ( US $ 7.9 million ) worldwide , and proved to be Kapoor 's highest-grossing film to that point . Reviews of the film , however , were negative ; Raja Sen termed the film a \" nightmare \" and wrote that Kapoor \" isn 't offensively bad , doesn 't ham it up like crazy , or speak in a weird accent . Having said that , he isn 't an actor at all , standing around working on his boyish grin , simply chewing up the scenery . No screen presence at all . \" Kapoor found no success in his first release of 2007 \u2014 the ensemble comedy Fool & Final . However , his second release that year , the Imtiaz Ali-directed romantic comedy Jab We Met proved to be one of the top-grossing films of the year . The film tells the story of a troubled businessman ( Kapoor ) whose life undergoes a series of changes after he encounters a loquacious girl ( Kareena Kapoor ) on a train ride . Ali thought that Kapoor 's previous roles failed to justify his acting potential , and thus approached him to portray a more complex character . The BBC noted on how \" endearing \" he was in the film and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote that he left an \" indelible impression with a performance that is understated and mature \" in a film he thought primarily belonged to Kareena Kapoor . For his performance , Kapoor received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor . After featuring opposite Vidya Balan in the romantic comedy Kismat Konnection ( 2008 ) , Kapoor played twin brothers , one with a lisp and the other with a stutter , in Vishal Bhardwaj 's critically acclaimed caper thriller Kaminey ( 2009 ) . In preparation , Kapoor met speech specialists and researched on the medical and mental aspects of the two conditions . To create a lean physique for one of the brothers , a look he considered to be \" radically different \" from his personal appearance , Kapoor practiced functional training and followed a rigorous diet . Writing for Variety , critic Joe Leydon reviewed that Kapoor \" impressively displays sufficiently variegated degrees of emotional intensity to sustain the illusion of two distinct characters . Just as important , he provides each sibling an appropriately elevated hunkiness quotient . \" Rediff.com listed Kapoor 's performance as the best by a Bollywood actor in 2009 and he received a second Best Actor nomination at Filmfare . Kaminey earned over \u20b9 700 million ( US $ 10 million ) worldwide . Kapoor 's final release of 2009 was as a cricketer in Dil Bole Hadippa ! , a romantic comedy co-starring Rani Mukerji . It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival , but was a financial failure . = = = Commercial fluctuations ( 2010 \u2013 13 ) = = = In 2010 , Kapoor reteamed with Ken Ghosh in Chance Pe Dance , a comedy-drama about a struggling actor , in which Kapoor 's performance was described as \" uneven \" by Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis . He had a supporting role in Paathshaala , a drama about the education system in India , starring Nana Patekar , following which he starred in Yash Raj Films ' Badmaash Company , a comedy-drama about a group of overambitious youngsters who become con men . Rachel Saltz of The New York Times praised Kapoor 's look in the film , though Tushar Joshi of Mid Day thought that he was miscast . Kapoor 's fourth and final release that year was Satish Kaushik 's romantic comedy Milenge Milenge , which marked his fourth collaboration with Kareena Kapoor . Plagiarised from the Hollywood film Serendipity , the production was delayed since 2005 . During its production in December 2004 at Phuket , Kapoor requested a delay in filming to attend the premiere of Dil Maange More . The delay may have saved the lives of the crew , since the hotel booked for them was destroyed during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . With the exception of Badmaash Company , none of these films performed well commercially . Kapoor next appeared in his father 's directorial Mausam ( 2011 ) ; co-starring Sonam Kapoor , the star-crossed romance set over a decade , took two years to complete . Considering the film to be his \" dream project \" , Kapoor did not take on additional work while filming for it . For his role as an unambitious village boy who becomes an air force pilot , Kapoor trained to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon . Rajeev Masand reviewed that \" while he doesn \u2019 t quite cut it as a convincing IAF pilot , Shahid Kapoor is terrific as the small-town brat \" . The film was a box office flop and Kapoor was later regretful for spending so much time on the project . The following year , Kapoor took on another romantic role in Kunal Kohli 's Teri Meri Kahaani ( 2012 ) , co-starring Priyanka Chopra . It tells the story of a pair of star-crossed lovers who are reincarnated in three different eras . Filmfare reviewed that \" Shahid and Priyanka give it their best shot , but their charm doesn \u2019 t make up for the absence of a genuine kahani [ story ] \" . The comedy Phata Poster Nikhla Hero from director Rajkumar Santoshi was Kapoor 's first release of 2013 . His role was that of Vishwas Rao , a struggling actor who masquerades as a policeman . Critical reviews on the film were negative , though Kapoor 's performance was praised . As with his last few releases , the film earned little at the box office leading trade analysts to question his commercial appeal . This changed later that year , when he starred in Prabhu Deva 's action film R ... Rajkumar ; despite a negative critical reception , the film earned over \u20b9 995 million ( US $ 15 million ) worldwide , becoming Kapoor 's highest-grossing release . In a scathing review , Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV called the film a \" massive mess \" and wrote that Kapoor \" ends up looking more moronic than macho \" in it . Kapoor suffered from burn injuries on his back and hands while filming a stunt sequence in R ... Rajkumar . = = = Awards success ( 2014 \u2013 present ) = = = Kapoor next reunited with director Vishal Bhardwaj to film Haider ( 2014 ) , an adaptation of William Shakespeare 's tragedy Hamlet set during the Kashmir conflict of 1995 , in which he played the titular role opposite Tabu and Shraddha Kapoor . Kapoor described the film as the \" toughest \" of his career , and waived his fees to star in it . For the role , he shaved his head and learned to speak in a Kashmiri dialect . Haider garnered critical acclaim , though was controversial among Indian nationalists for its portrayal of the conflict in Kashmir . Sanjukta Sharma of Mint found the film to be an \" immensely effective reimagination of Shakespeare \" and particularly praised Kapoor for playing his part with \" impressive zest and inventiveness \" . Writing for Hindustan Times , critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Kapoor initially seemed uncomfortable in the complex central role , but added that he \" slowly [ ... ] comes to inhabit Haider , veering from rage to jealousy to madness in a heartbeat . \" Kapoor won several awards for the role , including the Screen Award , Producers Guild Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Actor . The year 2015 saw Kapoor feature as a talent judge on the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded . His sole film release that year was opposite Alia Bhatt in Vikas Bahl 's Shaandaar , a romantic comedy about two insomniacs who fall in love during a destination wedding . Despite high expectations from trade analysts , the film earned negative reviews and emerged as a commercial failure . Kapoor next took on the role of a drug abusing rock star in Udta Punjab ( 2016 ) , a crime drama from the director Abhishek Chaubey that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state of Punjab . Kapoor , a teetotaler , found it challenging to play a character who he deemed to be \" all about addiction \" . He based the role on several pop stars , and was particularly interested in bringing out the character 's hidden vulnerability despite his obnoxious actions . Udta Punjab generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release , citing that the portrayal of Punjab in it was negative . The demands sparked a broad debate about the freedom of expression in India . After the producers of the film filed lawsuit against the board , the Bombay High Court cleared the film for exhibition with a single scene cut , in which Kapoor 's character is shown urinating on people . In a highly positive review , Sukanya Verma took note of the film 's anti-drug message ; in addition , she considered Kapoor to be \" spectacularly unbridled \" in his part and added that \" the believability he brings to his complex transition while preserving his inherent flakiness deserves all the praise \" . As of June 2016 , Kapoor he has completed filming the part of a soldier in Rangoon , a romantic drama set during World War II , co-starring Saif Ali Khan and Kangana Ranaut , which marks his third collaboration with Vishal Bhardwaj . = = Personal life and off-screen work = = Kapoor 's personal life is the subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India . During the filming of Fida in 2004 , he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship . They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set of pictures of them kissing in public . Despite claims by the couple that the pictures were fabricated , the newspaper denied any wrongdoing . The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab We Met . Since their split , Kapoor decided to keep his personal life away from media attention . However , tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses , including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra . In March 2015 , Kapoor spoke of his impending marriage to Mira Rajput , a student from New Delhi , who is 13 years his junior . The Times of India reported that Kapoor met Rajput through the religious group Radha Soami Satsang Beas . The couple married at a private ceremony in Gurgaon on 7 July 2015 . They are expecting their first child in fall 2016 . In addition to acting in films , Kapoor performs on stage and hosts award ceremonies .

Someone you \u2019 d want to play video games with on a Sunday , but keep the hell away from your sister \" . However , certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental . Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles . Addressing this image , Kapoor remarked , \" I just don \u2019 t socialise much , I don \u2019 t party too much , I don \u2019 t know what to say to the media if I \u2019 m not talking about a film that I am doing , so yeah , maybe I am perceived as a snob . \" Analysing his career , the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama published that his \" boy next door persona \" was initially perceived by critics as a weakness , but credited him for turning it into a trademark . Jitesh Pillai of Filmfare wrote that after gaining recognition in urban romantic roles , Kapoor defied typecasting by taking on diverse parts in crime dramas and action films . He noted that Kapoor 's refusal to be \" slotted under any kind of tag \" led to a fluctuating career trajectory . Following the success of Jab We Met ( 2007 ) and Kaminey ( 2009 ) , Kapoor 's career went through a decline ; he described the phase as a series of \" wrong choices \" and said that taking on a challenging role in Haider ( 2014 ) helped him reinvent himself . Sonal Gera of The Indian Express opined that the film established him in Bollywood . In her book Power of a Common Man , the author Koral Dasgupta writes that Kapoor does not \" [ conform ] to any fixed rules of the trade \" , and notes that despite having a lopsided success ratio at the box office , he remains popular among the audiences .

The film tells the story of a paleontologist in a number of predicaments involving a scatterbrained woman and a leopard named Baby . The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde which originally appeared in Collier 's Weekly magazine on April 10 , 1937 . The script was written specifically for Hepburn , and was tailored to her personality . Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938 ; it was over schedule and over budget . Production was frequently delayed due to uncontrollable laughing fits between Hepburn and Grant . Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by her co-star , vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett . A tame leopard was used during the shooting ; its trainer was off-screen with a whip for all its scenes . Although it has a reputation as a flop upon its release , Bringing up Baby was moderately successful in many cities and eventually made a small profit after its re-release in the early 1940s . Shortly after the film 's premiere , Hepburn was infamously labeled box-office poison by the Independent Theatre Owners of America and would not regain her success until The Philadelphia Story two years later . The film 's reputation began to grow during the 1950s , when it was shown on television . Since then , the film has received acclaim from both critics and audience for its zany antics and pratfalls , absurd situations and misunderstandings , perfect sense of comic timing , completely screwball cast , series of lunatic and hare-brained misadventures , disasters , light-hearted surprises and romantic comedy . Nowadays , it is considered one of the greatest films ever made . In 1972 director Peter Bogdanovich filmed a loose remake of the film entitled What 's Up , Doc ? In 1990 Bringing Up Baby was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as \" culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant \" , and it has appeared on a number of greatest-films lists , ranking at 88th on the American Film Institute 's 100 greatest American films of all time list . = = Plot = = David Huxley ( Cary Grant ) is a mild-mannered paleontologist .

The day before his wedding , David meets Susan Vance ( Katharine Hepburn ) by chance on a golf course . She is a free-spirited young lady , and ( unknown to him at first ) Mrs. Random 's niece . Susan 's brother , Mark , has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby ( Nissa ) to give to their aunt . ( The leopard is native to Africa and Asia but not to South America . ) Susan thinks David is a zoologist ( rather than a paleontologist ) , and persuades David to go to her country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby ( which includes singing \" I Can 't Give You Anything But Love \" to soothe the leopard ) . Complications arise as Susan falls in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage . David finally receives the intercostal clavicle , but Susan 's dog George ( Asta ) steals and buries it . Susan 's aunt , Elizabeth Random , arrives . The dowager is unaware of David 's identity , since Susan has introduced him as \" Mr. Bone \" . Baby and George run off , and Susan and David mistake a dangerous leopard who has escaped from a nearby circus ( also portrayed by Nissa ) for Baby . They are jailed by a befuddled town policeman , Constable Slocum ( Walter Catlett ) , for breaking into the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman ( Fritz Feld ) ( where they had cornered the circus leopard ) . When Slocum does not believe their story , Susan tells him they are members of the \" Leopard Gang \" ; she calls herself \" Swingin ' Door Susie \" , and David \" Jerry the Nipper \" . David fails to convince the constable that Susan makes things up \" from motion pictures she 's seen \" . Eventually , Alexander Peabody ( George Irving ) shows up to verify everyone 's identity . Susan ( who has sneaked out a window ) unwittingly drags the irritated circus leopard into the jail ; David saves her , using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell . Several weeks later , Susan finds David ( who has been jilted by Alice because of her ) working on his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum . After giving him the missing bone ( which she found by trailing George ) , she tells him she has persuaded her aunt to make the large donation . Against his advice , Susan climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him . When the ladder starts swaying from side to side dangerously , she climbs onto the skeleton . Before it collapses , David grabs her hand . Surveying the wreckage of his work , David gives up and admits that he cannot live without her . = = Cast = = = = Production = = = = = Development and writing = = = In March 1937 Howard Hawks signed a contract at RKO for an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling 's \" Gunga Din \" , which had been in pre-production since the previous fall . When RKO was unable to borrow Clark Gable , Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the film and the adaptation of \" Gunga Din \" was delayed , Hawks began looking for a new project . In April 1937 he read a short story by Hagar Wilde in Collier 's magazine called \" Bringing Up Baby \" and immediately wanted to make a film from it , remembering that it made him laugh out loud . RKO bought the screen rights in June for $ 1,004 , and Hawks worked briefly with Wilde on the film 's treatment . Wilde 's short story differed significantly from the film : David and Susan are engaged , he is not a scientist and there is no dinosaur , intercostal clavicle or museum . However , Susan gets a pet panther from her brother Mark to give to their Aunt Elizabeth ; David and Susan must capture the panther in the Connecticut wilderness with the help of Baby 's favorite song , \" I Can 't Give You Anything but Love , Baby \" . Hawks then hired screenwriter Dudley Nichols , best known for his work with director John Ford , for the script ; Wilde would develop the characters and comedic elements of the script , while Nichols would take care of the story and structure . Hawks worked with the two writers during summer 1937 , and they came up with a 202-page script . Wilde and Nichols wrote several drafts together , beginning a romantic relationship and co-authoring the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film Carefree a few months later . The Bringing Up Baby script underwent several changes , and at one point there was an elaborate pie fight , inspired by Mack Sennett films . Major Applegate had an assistant and food taster named Ali ( which was intended to be played by Mischa Auer ) , but this character was replaced with Aloysius Gogarty . The script 's final draft had several scenes in the middle of the film in which David and Susan declare their love for each other which Hawks cut during production . Nichols was instructed to write the film for Hepburn , with whom he had worked on John Ford 's Mary of Scotland in 1936 . Barbara Leaming alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn , and claims that many of the characteristics of Susan and David were based on Hepburn and Ford . Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting , and the film included such members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond , Barry Fitzgerald , D 'Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid . John Ford was a friend of Hawks , and visited the set . The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford . Filming was initially scheduled to begin on September 1 , 1937 and wrap on October 31 , but was delayed for several reasons . Production had to wait until mid-September to clear the rights for \" I Can 't Give You Anything but Love , Baby \" for $ 1,000 . In August Hawks hired gag writers Robert McGowan and Gertrude Purcell for uncredited script rewrites , and McGowan added a scene inspired by the comic strip Professor Dinglehoofer and his Dog in which a dog buries a rare dinosaur bone . RKO paid King Features $ 1,000 to use the idea for the film on September 21 . = = = = Unscripted ad-lib by Grant = = = = It is debated by some whether Bringing Up Baby is the first fictional work ( apart from pornography ) to use the word \" gay \" in a homosexual context . In one scene , Cary Grant 's character is wearing a woman 's marabou-trimmed n\u00e9glig\u00e9e ; when asked why , he replies exasperatedly \" Because I just went gay all of a sudden ! \" ( leaping into the air at the word \" gay \" ) . As the term \" gay \" did not become familiar to the general public until the Stonewall riots in 1969 , it is debated whether the word was used here in its original sense ( meaning \" happy \" ) or is an intentional , joking reference to homosexuality . In the film , the line was an ad-lib by Grant and not in any version of the original script . According to Vito Russo in The Celluloid Closet ( 1981 , revised 1987 ) , the script originally had Grant 's character say \" I ... I suppose you think it 's odd , my wearing this . I realize it looks odd ... I don 't usually ... I mean , I don 't own one of these \" . Russo suggests that this indicates that people in Hollywood ( at least in Grant 's circles ) were familiar with the slang connotations of the word ; however , neither Grant nor anyone involved in the film suggested this . = = = Casting = = = After briefly considering Hawks ' cousin Carole Lombard for the role of Susan Vance , Katharine Hepburn was chosen to play the wealthy New Englander because of her background and similarities to the character . RKO agreed to the casting , but had reservations because of Hepburn 's salary and lack of box-office success for several years . Producer Lou Lusty said , \" You couldn 't even break even if a Hepburn show cost eight hundred grand . \" At first , Hawks and producer Pandro S. Berman could not agree on who to cast in the role of David Huxley . Hawks initially wanted silent-film comedian Harold Lloyd ; Berman rejected Lloyd and Ronald Colman , offering the role to Robert Montgomery , Fredric March and Ray Milland ( all of whom turned it down ) . Hawks ' friend Howard Hughes finally suggested Cary Grant for the role . Grant had just finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth , and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film . Grant then had a non-exclusive , four-picture deal with RKO for $ 50,000 per film , and Grant 's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract , earning him $ 75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving . Grant was initially concerned about being able to play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role , despite the new contract . Hawks built Grant 's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film , instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration . Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character , which he said helped his performance . Hawks obtained character actors Charlie Ruggles on loan from Paramount Pictures for Major Horace Applegate and Barry Fitzgerald on loan from The Mary Pickford Corporation to play gardener Aloysius Gogarty . Hawks cast Virginia Walker as Alice Swallow , David 's fianc\u00e9e ; Walker was under contract to him and later married his brother William Hawks . As Hawks could not find a panther that would work for the film , Baby was changed to a leopard so they could cast the trained leopard Nissa , who had worked in films for eight years , making several B-movies . = = = Filming = = = Shooting began September 23 , 1937 and was scheduled to end November 20 , 1937 on a budget of $ 767,676 . Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan 's apartment , moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes . The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn 's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities . She frequently overacted , trying too hard to be funny , and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her . Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn , showing her that he was funnier when he was serious . Hepburn understood , acted naturally and played herself for the rest of the shoot ; she was so impressed by Catlett 's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film . Most shooting was done at the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley , which was used as Aunt Elizabeth 's estate for interior and exterior scenes . Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot , Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh . The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars ' laughing fits . After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule . During the filming , Hawks would refer to four different versions of the film 's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue . His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film , and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five . Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars ' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors . The terrier George was played by Skippy , known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant ( as Mr. Smith ) in The Awful Truth . The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both played by a trained leopard , Nissa . The big cat was supervised by its trainer , Olga Celeste , who stood by with a whip during shooting . At one point , when Hepburn spun around ( causing her skirt to twirl ) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip . Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard , but Grant was terrified ; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in . Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant 's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks ' difficulty filming a live leopard , and some scenes required rear-screen projection . Hawks and Hepburn had a confrontation one day during shooting . While Hepburn was chatting with a crew member , Hawks yelled \" Quiet ! \" until the only person still talking was Hepburn . When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was looking at her , she asked what was the matter ; Hawks asked her if she was finished imitating a parrot . Hepburn took Hawks aside , telling him never to talk to her like that again since she was old friends with most of the crew . When Hawks ( an older friend of the crew ) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on , Hepburn agreed to behave on set . A variation of this scene , with Grant yelling \" Quiet ! \" , was incorporated into the film . The Westlake Street set was shot at 20th Century Fox Studios . Filming was eventually completed on January 6 , 1938 with the scenes outside Mr. Peabody 's house . RKO producers expressed concerns about the film 's delays and expense , coming 40 days over schedule and $ 330,000 over budget , and also disliked Grant 's glasses and Hepburn 's hair . The film 's final cost was $ 1,096,796.23 , primarily due to overtime clauses in Hawks ' , Grant 's and Hepburn 's contracts . The film 's cost for sets and props was only $ 5,000 over budget , but all actors ( including Nissa and Skippy ) were paid approximately double their initial salaries . Hepburn 's salary rose from $ 72,500 to $ 121,680.50 , Grant 's salary from $ 75,000 to $ 123,437.50 and Hawks ' salary from $ 88,046.25 to $ 202,500 . The director received an additional $ 40,000 to terminate his RKO contract on March 21 , 1938 . = = = Post-production and previews = = = Hawks ' editor , George Hively , cut the film during production and the final prints were made a few days after shooting ended . The first cut of the film ( 10,150 feet long ) was sent to the Hayes Office in mid-January . Despite several double entendres and sexual references it passed the film , overlooking Grant saying he \" went gay \" or Hepburn 's reference to George urinating . The censor 's only objections were to the scene where Hepburn 's dress is torn , and references to politicians ( such as Al Smith and Jim Farley ) . Like all Hawks ' comedies , the film is known for its fast pace ( despite being filmed primarily in long medium shots , with little cross-cutting ) . Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich , \" You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast \" . By February 18 , the film had been cut to 9,204 feet . It had two advance previews in January 1938 , where it received either As or A-pluses on audience-feedback cards . Producer Pandro S. Berman wanted to cut five more minutes , but relented when Hawks , Grant and Cliff Reid objected . At the film 's second preview , the film received rave reviews and RKO expected a hit . The film 's musical score is minimal , primarily Grant and Hepburn singing \" I Can 't Give You Anything But Love , Baby \" . There is incidental music in the Ritz scene , and an arrangement of \" I Can 't Give You Anything But Love , Baby \" during the opening and closing credits by musical director Roy Webb . = = Reception and box office = = The film received good advance reviews ; Otis Ferguson of The New Republic thought the film very funny , praising Hawks ' direction . Variety praised the film , singling out Hawks ' pacing and direction , calling Hepburn 's performance \" one of her most invigorating screen characterizations \" and saying Grant \" performs his role to the hilt \" ; their only criticism was the length of the jail scene . Film Daily called it \" literally a riot from beginning to end , with the laugh total heavy and the action fast . \" Harrison 's Reports called the film \" An excellent farce \" with \" many situations that provoke hearty laughter , \" and John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that both stars \" manage to be funny \" and that Hepburn had never \" seemed so good-natured . \" However , Frank S. Nugent of the New York Times disliked the film , considering it derivative and clich\u00e9-ridden , a rehash of dozens of other screwball comedies of the period . He labeled Hepburn 's performance \" breathless , senseless , and terribly , terribly fatiguing \" , and added , \" If you 've never been to the movies , Bringing Up Baby will be new to you \u2013 a zany-ridden product of the goofy-farce school . But who hasn 't been to the movies ? \" Despite Bringing Up Baby 's reputation as a flop , it was successful in some parts of the U.S. The film premiered on February 16 , 1938 at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco ( where it was a hit ) , and was also successful in Los Angeles , Portland , Denver , Cincinnati and Washington , D.C .. However , it was a financial disappointment in the Midwest , as well as most other cities in the country , including NYC ; to RKO 's chagrin , the film 's premiere in New York on March 3 , 1938 at Radio City Music Hall made only $ 70,000 and it was pulled after one week in favor of Jezebel with Bette Davis . During its first run , Bringing Up Baby made $ 715,000 in the U.S. and $ 394,000 in foreign markets for a total of $ 1,109,000 ; its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an additional $ 95,000 in the US and $ 55,000 in foreign markets . Following its second run , the film made a profit of $ 163,000 . Due to its perceived failure , Hawks was released early from his two-film contract with RKO and Gunga Din was eventually directed by George Stevens . Hawks later said the film \" had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that . There were no normal people in it . Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I learned my lesson and don 't intend ever again to make everybody crazy \" . The director went on to work with RKO on three films over the next decade . Long before Bringing Up Baby 's release , Hepburn had been branded \" box-office poison \" by Harry Brandt ( president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America ) and thus was allowed to buy out her RKO contract for $ 22,000 . However , many critics marveled at her new skill at low comedy ; Life magazine called her \" the surprise of the picture \" . Hepburn 's former boyfriend Howard Hughes bought RKO in 1941 , and sold it in 1959 ; when he sold the company , Hughes retained the copyright to six films ( including Bringing Up Baby ) . = = Legacy = = Bringing Up Baby was the second of four films starring Grant and Hepburn ; the others were Sylvia Scarlett ( 1935 ) , Holiday ( 1938 ) and The Philadelphia Story ( 1940 ) . The film 's concept was described by philosopher Stanley Cavell as a \" definitive achievement in the history of the art of film . \" Cavell noted that Bringing Up Baby was made in a tradition of romantic comedy with inspiration from ancient Rome and Shakespeare . Shakespeare 's Much Ado About Nothing and As You Like It have been cited in particular as an influence on the film and the screwball comedy in general , with their \" haughty , self-sufficient men , strong women and fierce combat of words and wit . \" Hepburn 's character has been cited as an early example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl film archetype . The popularity of Bringing Up Baby has increased since it was shown on television during the 1950s , and by the 1960s film analysts ( including the writers at Cahiers du Cinema in France ) affirmed the film 's quality . In a rebuttal of fellow New York Times critic Nugent 's scathing review of the film at the time of release , A. O. Scott has said that you 'll \" find yourself amazed at its freshness , its vigor , and its brilliance-qualities undiminished after sixty-five years , and likely to withstand repeated viewings . \" Leonard Maltin stated that it is now \" considered the definitive screwball comedy , and one of the fastest , funniest films ever made ; grand performances by all . \" Bringing Up Baby has been adapted several times . Hawks recycled the nightclub scene in which Hepburn 's dress is torn and Grant walks behind her in the 1964 comedy , Man 's Favorite Sport . Peter Bogdanovich 's 1972 film What 's Up , Doc ? , starring Barbra Streisand , was intended as an homage to the film , and has contributed to its reputation . In the commentary track for Bringing Up Baby , Bogdanovich discusses how the coat-ripping scene in What 's Up , Doc ? was based on the scene in which Grant 's coat and Hepburn 's dress are torn in Bringing Up Baby . The 1987 film Who 's That Girl ? , starring Madonna , is also loosely based on Bringing Up Baby . In 1990 ( the registry 's second year ) , Bringing Up Baby was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as \" culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant \" . Entertainment Weekly voted the film 24th on its list of greatest films . In 2000 , readers of Total Film magazine voted it the 47th-greatest comedy film of all time . Premiere ranked Cary Grant 's performance as Dr. David Huxley 68th on its list of 100 all-time greatest performances , and ranked Susan Vance 21st on its list of 100 all-time greatest movie characters . The National Society of Film Critics also included Bringing Up Baby in their \" 100 Essential Films \" , considering it to be arguably the director 's best film . = = = American Film Institute recognition = = = 1998 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies \u2013 # 97 2000 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs \u2013 # 14 2002 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Passions \u2013 # 51 2005 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes : Dr. David Huxley : \" It isn 't that I don 't like you , Susan , because after all , in moments of quiet , I 'm strangely drawn toward you ; but , well , there haven 't been any quiet moments ! \" \u2013 Nominated 2007 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies ( 10th Anniversary Edition ) \u2013 # 88 2008 : AFI 's 10 Top 10 : Nominated Romantic Comedy Film",

R. Panthulu . The film 's screenplay was written by Ma . Po . Sivagnanam while its story and dialogue were written by Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy . The film features Sivaji Ganesan , Gemini Ganesan , Padmini , S. Varalakshmi , and Ragini in the lead roles , with V. K. Ramasamy and Javar Seetharaman in pivotal supporting parts . Produced and distributed by Panthulu under his banner , Padmini Pictures , Veerapandiya Kattabomman is loosely based on the story of the 18th century South Indian chieftain of the same name , who rose in rebellion against the East India Company . The film was an adaptation of the play Kattabomman , performed by Sivaji Ganesan 's troupe . Most of the film was shot in Jaipur . Veerapandiya Kattabomman is notable for being the first Tamil film to be shot in Technicolor . Veerapandiya Kattabomman 's premiere was held in London on 10 May 1959 , and it was released in Tamil Nadu six days later . It became a critical and commercial success and had a theatrical run of 175 days . It was dubbed and released in Telugu as Veerapandiya Kattabrahmanna in 1959 and in Hindi as Amar Shaheed in 1960 . In addition to winning the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil under the \" Certificate of Merit \" section , it was also the first Tamil film to receive international awards for Best Film , Best Actor , and Best Music Director at the 1960 Afro-Asian Film Festival in Cairo . A digitally restored version of the film was released on 21 August 2015 . = = Plot = = Veerapandiya Kattabomman ( Sivaji Ganesan ) , the king of Panchalankurichi , is a brave fighter and a devotee of his family deity , Lord Murugan of Tiruchendur . On receiving the news of a robbery in his territory , Kattabomman and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers . When the robbers are captured , they confess that they had been hired by the British to create unrest in Kattabomman 's domain . They also tell him that the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain , Ettappan ( V. K. Ramasamy ) , to help them in their endeavour to annexe Panchalankurichi . Ettappan was promised that an additional two villages would be added to his land by the British , as a price for his betrayal . Ettappan , in disguise , goes to Kattabomman 's court and tries to frighten him by extolling the omnipotence of the British . Kattabomman is indignant and tears off Ettappan 's fake beard , but spares him because he had come to his court as an ambassador . At Chayalkudi , a village near Panchalankurichi , lives Vellaiyammal ( Padmini ) , who vows to marry the man who tames her pet bull . She takes her bull to participate in a Jallikattu game held at Panchalankurichi under Kattabomman 's patronage . All those who attempt to tame the bull fail . At Kattabomman 's call , his Commander-in-chief , Vellaiyathevan ( Gemini Ganesan ) , subdues the bull and wins Vellaiyammal 's love . Later , Kattabomman comes to know of their love and gets them married . Kattabomman receives a message from Lord W. C. Jackson ( C. R. Parthiban ) , collector of Tirunelveli , who demands a meeting with Kattabomman at Ramanathapuram to discuss the payment of Kattabomman 's tribute . Captain Davison ( S. A. Kannan ) , Kattabomman 's British friend , advises him to go and see Jackson . Jackson , finding that Kattabomman has come to see him with his troops , demands to meet him alone . At the meeting , Jackson insults him and orders his arrest . Though surrounded by the British troops , Kattabomman fights his way out , but during his escape his Minister , Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai ( M. R. Santhanam ) , is captured by the British . Some time later , Pillai is released . He brings news that Jackson has been transferred back to England on Davison 's recommendation . At Kattabomman 's court , a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington , Tirunelveli 's new collector , reports that Pillai and his men have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam . Pillai justifies his act , saying that he instructed his men to do it due to the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom . Ashamed of Pillai 's act , Kattabomman accuses him of injustice . Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British , but Kattabomman refuses to hand Pillai over ; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice . Ooshington does not agree and , with Major Bannerman 's ( Javar Seetharaman ) and Ettappan 's help , instigates the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman . Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops . He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur . Kattabomman 's spy Sunderalingam ( A. Karunanidhi ) , overhears this and informs Kattabomman , who prepares for battle . On the day of the battle , Vellaiyammal pleads Vellaiyathevan not to go because the previous night she had a nightmare , which was full of evil omens . Ignoring her entreaties , Vellaiyathevan sets out , and is killed in the ensuing battle . Vellaiyammal , on learning of his death , kills the man who killed him , avenging her husband 's death . She finds Vellaiyathevan 's corpse and , out of grief , falls dead on it . Bannerman 's troops attack Panchalankurichi with heavy artillery and Kattabomman 's army suffers badly . Kattabomman is wounded in the neck , but is saved by his brother , Oomaithurai ( O. A. K. Thevar ) . Sensing that the fort cannot survive another cannon barrage , Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to the adjoining kingdom of Kovilpatti . Pillai , disguising himself as Kattabomman , misleads the British soldiers who are on the trail of Kattabomman . From Kovilpatti , Kattabomman and Oomaithurai then flee to Pudukkottai . Thondaimaan , the king of Pudukkottai , is ordered by the British to capture Kattabomman and Oomaithurai . In fear of the British , Thondaimaan captures the two and hands them over . While Oomaithurai is jailed , Kattabomman faces a summary trial by the British and is hanged from a Tamarind tree at Kayatharu . = = Cast = = Lead actors Sivaji Ganesan as Veerapandiya Kattabomman Gemini Ganesan as Vellaiyathevan Padmini as Vellaiyammal S.

In 1947 , soon after the British left India , a production company announced its intention to produce Kattabommu ( named after the rebel 's real name ) , a \" mammoth production \" which was to star P. U. Chinnappa ; this production did not materialise . Another attempt was initiated in 1953 by producer S. S. Vasan . A promotional poster announcing the project was released in Ananda Vikatan on 5 November 1953 . On 8 November 1953 , a notice was issued at Vasan 's production company , Gemini Studios , through Ananda Vikatan stating that anyone who had any useful information regarding Kattabomman and his exploits can send them to the studios ' storyboard department . The concept of Veerapandiya Kattabomman began when Sivaji Ganesan and Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy were travelling through Kayatharu , where Kattabomman was hanged . While there , Ganesan expressed a desire of doing a play based on Kattabomman 's life , to which Krishnasamy immediately agreed , and started to write the play . Coincidentally , Ganesan 's first exposure to the field of acting was when he saw a street play on Kattabomman \u2019 s life titled Kambalaththaar Kooththu . Krishnasamy completed writing the script for the play in a month 's time . The play was launched in Salem on 29 August 1957 . Ganesan had invested close to \u20b9 50,000 for the play 's sets and costumes . On seeing the play , B. R. Panthulu decided to adapt it into a feature film and hired Krishnasamy to write the screenplay . G. Dharmarajan , who was the play 's set designer , was selected to do the same for the film . For the purpose of making the popular play into a film , a \" History-Film Format Research Group \" was formed under the leadership of Ma . Po . Sivagnanam , with Krishnasamy , Panthulu , Ganesan , P. A. Kumar , K. Singamuthu , and S. Krishnaswamy as members . = = = Production = = = The Singapore-based Indian Movie News stated in 1957 that when Ganesan heard of Vasan 's attempt to make a film adaptation on Kattabomman , he personally requested Vasan to abandon the project , adding that Vasan even lent Ganesan important research materials on Kattabomman . Film historian Randor Guy contradicted this in his 1997 book Starlight , Starbright : The Early Tamil Cinema by stating that writers like Kothamangalam Subbu and Veppathur Kittoo were employed by Vasan to conduct an extensive research on Kattabomman 's life , but the only eligible choice to play Kattabomman was Ganesan , who by then had become popular after Parasakthi ( 1952 ) . Guy noted that Ganesan was hesitant to play the role under Vasan 's direction as he was earlier rejected by Vasan for the role of a bodyguard in Chandralekha ( 1948 ) , which led to Vasan dropping the project . But later on , Ganesan acted in Irumbu Thirai ( 1960 ) , which was produced and directed by Vasan , and Motor Sundaram Pillai ( 1966 ) , which was produced by Vasan . Ganesan originally offered the role of Vellaiyathevan to S. S. Rajendran , who declined it due to his commitment to the film Sivagangai Seemai ( 1959 ) . He later requested actress Savitri to ask her husband Gemini Ganesan to play the role , which she agreed to do despite being pregnant at that time . Gemini Ganesan was initially reluctant to accept the role , but eventually agreed . Padmini , O. A. K. Thevar , and V. K. Ramasamy were chosen to play Vellaiyammal , Oomaithurai and Ettappan respectively . S. Varalakshmi played Kattabomman 's wife , Jakkamma , and also worked as a playback singer . C. R. Parthiban played the role of Lord W. C. Jackson , and M. R. Santhanam played the minister , Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai . Kattabomman 's daughter in the film , Meena , was a fictional character created by Krishnasamy . The character was based on Krishnasamy 's own daughter , Mynavathi , who died when she was five years old . Krishnasamy initially refused to include the scene involving Meena 's death as it reminded him of his daughter , but finally did so reluctantly . The character was played by Baby Kanchana . Principal photography began in October 1957 with a puja . Most of the film 's shooting took place at Jaipur . With help from Janakaraja , the man in charge of the cavalry division , the production unit of Veerapandiya Kattabomman managed to hire junior artistes to portray the cavalry soldiers for shooting the war scenes . When the film was being shot at Bharani Studios in 1958 , Adoor Gopalakrishnan , who witnessed the shooting that afternoon , recalled that after every take , the actors would rush out due to the intense heat on the set . He also stated , \" The speed of the film was so low those days that one needed many , many lights for correct exposure . \" Veerapandiya Kattabomman is notable for being the first Tamil film to be shot in Technicolor . Panthulu adopted American director Cecil B. DeMille 's tactic of personally introducing the film on camera . The final length of the film was 5,512 metres ( 18,084 ft ) . = = Music = = Veerapandiya Kattabomman 's original soundtrack album was composed by G. Ramanathan , with lyrics by Ku . Ma . Balasubramaniam . The soundtrack album was released on 1 December 1959 under the label of Saregama . The album became a major breakthrough for P. B. Srinivas , then a struggling playback singer . He was recruited by Ramanathan to sing the track \" Inbam Pongum Vennila \" , which was picturised on Gemini Ganesan and Padmini , with P. Susheela . The song \" Pogaathe Pogaathe \" is based on the Mukhari raga , \" Manam Kanintharul \" is based on the Kurinji raga , and \" Singara Kanne \" is based on the Brindavanasaranga raga . Theatre actor K. B. Chellamuthu was the violinist for the songs . A remix version of \" Inbam Pongum Vennila \" was done by Hiphop Tamizha for the film , Aambala ( 2015 ) . According to S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu , \" Manam Kanintharul \" and \" Singara Kanne \" , both of which were sung by Varalakshmi , \" remained all time favourites . \" On the song , \" Pogaathe Pogaathe \" , singer Charulatha Mani said that it was \" a meandering , melancholic Mukhari . \" She also labelled Ratnamala 's rendition of the song as \" expressive \" . Film critic Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu , in his review of the film 's digital re-release , said that Ramanathan 's music \" is still superb , spanning the range from folksy to light to classical \" . Tracklist All lyrics written by Ku . Ma . Balasubramaniam . = = Release = = Veerapandiya Kattabomman 's premiere was held in London on 10 May 1959 , and it was released in Tamil Nadu on 16 May 1959 . The film was a commercial success and achieved cult status in Tamil cinema , becoming a silver jubilee film . The film was dubbed and released in Telugu and Hindi as Veerapandiya Kattabrahmanna in 1959 , and Amar Shaheed in 1960 . = = = Critical reception = = = Veerapandiya Kattabomman received positive reviews upon release . Ananda Vikatan , in its original review dated 24 May 1959 , wrote , \" [ Veerapandiya ] Kattabomman will not leave the hearts of the people who have seen it ... Sivaji Ganesan has acted so well . This film adds pride to every person born as a Tamilian \" . Baradwaj Rangan praised Ganesan 's performance , stating that \" To watch Veerapandiya Kattabomman is to marvel at the shades and nuances an actor can infuse into oratory . \" India Today stated in 2001 , \" One doesn 't have to be well-versed in Tamil to feel the fire in Veerapandiya Kattabomman . \" Sri Lankan Canadian journalist D. B. S. Jeyaraj stated , \" The first Tamil film which impacted on me greatly during childhood was [ Veerapandiya Kattabomman ] ... The magic of the movie to me at that time was the portrayal of Kattabomman by the doyen of Tamil actors , Sivaji Ganesan . The highlight of that performance was the powerful delivery of fiery dialogue by the film hero Kattabomman played by Sivaji . \" N Sathiya Moorthy wrote for Rediff.com in 2001 , \" [ Ganesan 's ] portrayal of Lord Shiva in [ Thiruvilaiyadal ] and of freedom-fighters Veerapandia Kattabomman and Kappalottia Thamizhan V O Chidambaram have become symbolic of the very characters in the average Tamil mind across the world . \" Guy labelled Ganesan 's performance as \" breathtaking \" . Janani Karthik of The Times of India wrote , \" Watch this [ film ] for the legendary actor 's performance , something that old-timers remember even today \" . Another review from the same newspaper stated , \" This digitally restored version is far from perfect \u2014 there are instances when in the same scene , the colours seem to have been leached of the frames . The sound , too , feels a bit contemporary . And the casting of Indian actors to play the British characters feels dated and even amusing . But set these niggles aside and the film still retains its dramatic force . \" L. K. Advani , currently one of the senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party , said , \" I have seen the Tamil movie of Veerapandia Kattabomman [ sic ] , acted by [ Sivaji ] Ganesan , many times . It is fresh in my memory . \" = = = Accolades = = = Sivaji Ganesan 's performance as Kattabomman earned him an international award as the Best Actor at the 1960 Afro-Asian Film Festival , held from 29 February to 11 March . The award was presented to him by Gamal Abdel Nasser , then the President of Egypt . It was Ganesan 's first award in his film career . It also made him the first Indian actor to receive an international award . On hearing of Ganesan 's return from Cairo after winning the Afro-Asian Film Festival award for the Best Actor category in 1960 , fellow actor M. G. Ramachandran , who also served as the president of the South Indian Actors Guild organised a huge reception in Chennai to welcome him . In his autobiography , Ganesan recalled that during the Afro-Asian film festival , \" I was called on stage and I went up a diminutive , five foot nothing , looking boyish with my build , whereas they had expected me to be a colossus , on seeing [ Veerapandiya ] Kattabomman , at least seven or eight feet tall ! Irrespective of this they gave me a standing ovation for five minutes . \" = = Historical inaccuracies = = Veerapandiya Kattabomman has often been criticised because of its historical inaccuracies . Randor Guy stated in 2015 that a Tamil weekly even went to the extent of saying , \" [ ... ] a new face called Kattabomman acted brilliantly as Sivaji Ganesan ! \u201d Poet Kannadasan said , \" Kattabomman was not a real freedom fighter ; he was a Telugu and a robber . \" He also stated that the Maruthu Pandiyars were the real freedom fighters and wrote a script about them , which was adapted into the film , Sivagangai Seemai . The film was released in the same month as Veerapandiya Kattabomman , but failed at the box office . Kannadasan 's statement was supported by writer Lena Tamizhvanan , who denounced Kattabomman 's glorification . In Starlight , Starbright : The Early Tamil Cinema , Guy noted that according to East India Company records , Kattabomman was of Telugu ancestry , and that he was a strong and silent man , not of dash and daring as depicted in the film . Guy also noted that Ganesan portrayed Kattabomman as a \" larger-than-life-character , haranguing audiences in a high-flown Tamil replete with literary flourishes \" , as opposed to the real Kattabomman , who was not fluent in Tamil . Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen states , \" A love interest has been added as well \" , implying that the character of Vellaiyammal was fictional . Film historian S. Krishnaswamy , writing for The Hindu in 2001 , noted that the film was \" historically far from accurate \" and that it was \" more like a costume drama or a mythological . \" In their 2010 book , Cinemas of South India : Culture , Resistance , Ideology , Sowmya Dechamma C. C. and Elavarthi Sathya Prakash state that Kattabomman 's Telugu identity is used in such a way that \" while National historiography tries to elevate him , some versions of Tamil history seem to downgrade him . \" In 2011 , S. Theodore Baskaran said , \" Tamil films have scant regard for history . Almost always , they confuse between history and folklore , \" and added , \" Kattabomman was not even a king . His arsenal had just about three to four guns . \" In 2014 , Ramu Manivannan , the HOD of politics and public administration at University of Madras , told The Times of India , \" The popular images of [ historical ] characters have been constructed from oral descriptions and accounts . In some cases , the popular image overtakes the historical one as in the case of Sivaji Ganesan 's portrayal of Kattabomman on the screen \" . = = Legacy = = Veerapandiya Kattabomman took Ganesan 's career to a higher level , so much so that Tamil people identified Kattabomman with him . The film also became a trendsetter for presenting freedom fighters in a heroic manner , thus creating a new perception of the value of independence . The film 's success encouraged many in Tamil cinema to make films based on freedom fighters and historical figures , notable of which include Kappalottiya Thamizhan ( 1961 ) and Bharathi ( 2000 ) . Veerapandiya Kattabomman was re-released in 1984 during Ramachandran 's tenure as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu . The film was granted tax exemption by the state government and was commercially successful at that time as well . In 1970 , eleven years after the film 's release , Ganesan established a statue of Kattabomman at Kayatharu , where the rebel was hanged . A special postal cover designed by film historian and actor Mohan V. Raman was released on 16 May 2009 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the film 's release . The cover was jointly released by the Sivaji \u2013 Prabhu Charities trust and the Indo-Russian Cultural and Friendship Society . A. V. Ashok wrote for The Hindu , \" It is no exaggeration to say that Sivaji 's heroic outpouring as Veerapandiya Kattabomman is an integral part of the Tamil cultural psyche . \" Actor Sivakumar stated , \" You can \u2019 t reproduce movies like Parasakthi , Pasamalar , Devadas , Veerapandiya Kattabomman or Ratha Kanneer [ ... ] By remaking such films , you are lowering yourself , while it enhances the original artists \u2019 image . \" Suhasini Maniratnam listed Veerapandiya Kattabomman alongside Kappalottiya Thamizhan , Aayirathil Oruvan ( 1965 ) and Iruvar ( 1997 ) , as her favourite period films in Tamil . The Times of India included Veerapandiya Kattabomman in its list of \" Top 5 Sivaji Ganesan films on his birthday \" . An elephant that Ganesan presented to the Punnainallur Mariamman temple in 1960 was named \" Vellaiyammal \" , after the character from the film . It was later donated to the Brihadeeswarar Temple in 1980 . In Outlook 's issue dated 20 October 2008 , Ganesan 's line , \" Vari , vatti , kisthi ... Yaarai ketkirai vari ... Etharkku ketkirai vari . Vaanam polikirathu , bhumi vilaigirathu , unakken katta vendum vari .... \" , ( Roughly translated in English as \" Tributes , Tax , Loan , Interest . The rains pour from the sky , the land blossoms , why should I offer you money ? \" ) which he speaks in the scene featuring him and C. R. Parthiban , was ranked at number 8 in the magazine 's list of the \" 13 cheesiest , chalkiest lines in Indian cinema \" . Dhananjayan noted the line also became a text book example of dialogue delivery for aspiring actors . In April 2012 , Rediff included the film in its list \" The A to Z of Tamil Cinema \" . In a January 2015 interview with The Times of India , playwright Y. G. Mahendra said , \" most character artists today lack variety [ ... ] Show me one actor in India currently who can do a Kattabomman , a VOC , a Vietnam Veedu , a Galatta Kalyanam and a Thiruvilayadal . \" Actor Rana Daggubati , in an interview with Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu , said that Ganesan 's performances as Kattabomman and Karna ( in the 1964 film Karnan ) served as inspirations for his role in Baahubali ( 2015 ) . = = Re-release = = In 2012 , Raj Television Network announced that they would re-release Veerapandiya Kattabomman in 3D in early 2013 , but that did not materialise . However , in March 2015 , Raj Television Network announced that they would release a digital 5.1 surround sound version of the film in collaboration with Sai Ganesh Films , on an unspecified date in April , though it was eventually released on 21 August 2015 . The trailer of the digitised version was released on 20 March 2015 . Murali B.

A Romanian-French co-production based on a chapter from a novel by Petru Dumitriu , it stars British actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the Hungarian-born aristocrat Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Von Debretsy . Her marriage with Romanian Land Forces captain Petre Dumitriu brings her to Southern Dobruja ( present-day northeastern Bulgaria ) , where they settle in 1925 . There , she witnesses first-hand the violent clashes between , on one hand , the Greater Romanian administration , and , on the other , komitadji brigands of Macedonian origin and ethnic Bulgarian locals . The film shows her failed attempt to rescue Bulgarians held hostage by the Romanian soldiers , and who are destined for execution . An Unforgettable Summer also stars Claudiu Bleon\u0163 as Captain Dumitriu and Marcel Iure\u015f as Ipsilanti , a general whose unsuccessful attempt to seduce Von Debretsy and the resulting grudge he holds against the couple account for Dumitriu 's reassignment . Completed in the context of the Yugoslav wars , the film constitutes an investigation into the consequences of xenophobia and state-sanctioned repression , as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out . It is thus often described as a verdict on the history of Romania , as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large , and occasionally described as a warning that violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context . Released by MK2 Productions , An Unforgettable Summer was financed by the Council of Europe 's Eurimages fund for continental cinema . In the United States and elsewhere , it was made available on limited release . Other actors credited in secondary roles include George Constantin as General Tchilibia , R\u0103zvan Vasilescu as Colonel Turtureanu , Olga Tudorache as Madame Vorvoreanu , Cornel Scripcaru , Carmen Ungureanu , Dorina Laz\u0103r , Mihai Constantin and Ioan Gyuri Pascu . = = Plot = = The film 's plot , which develops as a flashback narrated by Dumitriu 's young son , opens with what American film magazine Variety called \" a mad gallop , with the camera in the saddle , giving viewers a crash course in regional rivalries circa 1925 . \" In the opening scenes , Romanian authorities are shown to be frantically engaged in shutting down a brothel , whose presence they believe would embarrass local high society at a time when a grand ball is set to take place . This scandalized prostitutes include the Hungarian Erzsi , who is also a communist sympathizer , and who irritates the officials by shouting out insults and mooning them through a window . During the latter scene , John Simon notes , Land Forces officers are shown staring up \" in mixed horror and admiration at the familiar globe whose owner they promptly identify . \" As she is beaten up by the soldiers , Erzsi continues to defy her aggressors by shouting up revolutionary slogans coined under the Hungarian Soviet Republic . The film then centers on the gala , which is attended by the Dumitrius and offers the setting for Von Debretsy 's rejection of General Ipsilanti 's advances . The characters ' backgrounds are explained through the gossip of Madame Vorvoreanu , a distant relative of Von Debretsy , who is attending the event . The spectators are thus told that Von Debretsy is the daughter of a Romanian boyaress and a member of the Hungarian aristocracy , and that she is held in contempt by the local notabilities . In parallel , Ipsilanti himself is shown to be not just a military commander , but also as a prince . Film historian Anne J\u00e4ckel describes the story as dealing with \" the slow descent into Hell of two honest , liberal people . \" The two persons are the short and monocled Captain Dumitriu and his sophisticated wife . Confronted with the general 's spiteful decision , they find themselves isolated to a garrison in a land frequently raided by Macedonian komitadji , in rebellion against Romanian rule . Initially shocked by the cultural clash , Von Debretsy , a mother of three , attempts to adapt her aristocratic lifestyle to the new requirements , but manages to make herself stand out when she continues to seek a life of luxury . French critic Sylvie Rollet argues that this attempt to \" tame the world \" by erecting \" frontiers \" is a central aspect of An Unforgettable Summer . While Petre Dumitriu is motivated by his pursuit of discipline , his wife preserves her sophistication , reading the works of Marcel Proust , playing the harpsichord , employing a nanny to educate her children , and comparing the surrounding landscape with Japan 's Mount Fuji . Variety calls her \" sensitive-yet-flamboyant in the mold of Zelda Fitzgerald \" . To her husband 's assurance that they were not going to spend long in Southern Dobruja , she replies : \" I like it here . \" In pursuing this path , she only manages to widen the gap between her and most other characters . This rift is made apparent by a number of omens : unknown attackers through rocks into the Dumitrius ' house , while the vegetables she planted in the garden prove unpalatable . Confronted with these signs , Von Debretsy still attempts to make the best of the situation ; online film critic James Berardinelli notes : \" [ She ] does her best to make a happy home for her family , despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors . \" Bulgarian locals , taken as hostages by the military , are made to work on the garden . Their labor brings immediate improvement to the crop , and , upset by their condition , Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se decides to pay them out of her own pocket , serves them tea and eventually befriends them . In a scene that provided the original title for Petru Dumitriu 's book chapter ( \" The Salad \" ) , she invites Ipsilanti and other officers to dinner , and they are all shown to be enjoying the salad provided by Bulgarian labor . However , the episode also renews tensions between Ipsilanti and his Hungarian host , when she expresses her appreciation of her servants ' work and attempts to intervene on their behalf . As a result of one Macedonian incursion , during which border guards are killed , Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute a number of his Bulgarian prisoners . Horrified by this random reprisal , Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se strives to have them pardoned and released , but her plea only serves to irritate her husband 's superiors . Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels , whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing . The resulting toll on Dumitriu 's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja , shortly before which the captain 's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple . The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that , as Hungarians , both women are natural suspects in Romania . It is a result of this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide , unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple , and ultimately falling of the stool ( which his mare had chewed on ) and weeping uncontrollably . This episode , Simon points out , was not present in the original text , and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive . In what is one of the closing scenes , Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed . = = Production = = Together with its predecessor Balan\u0163a , which is sometimes seen as Pintilie 's greatest success , An Unforgettable Summer is one of the director 's main films of the 1990s . During the previous decade , his work had been censored by the communist regime , which came to an end during the Romanian Revolution of 1989 . The two films are thus among the first in which Pintilie was allowed to express himself freely . The New York Times chronicler Caryn James writes : \" His return [ with An Unforgettable Summer ] has added a significant name to the list of world film makers . \" The two films were both produced with assistance from Eurimages , and were donated production funds from French private ventures , as well as from the French state . The credited producers of the film also include the television stations La Sept and Canal Plus , the Romanian Ministry of Culture 's Studio of Film Production and the French Ministry of Culture 's Centre national de la cin\u00e9matographie , the Romanian firm Filmex , as well as filmmakers Marin Karmitz and Constantin Popescu . The screenplay , written by Pintilie , was based on the Petru Dumitriu 's novel Cronic\u0103 de familie ( \" Family Chronicle \" ) , and in particular on its chapter Salata ( \" The Salad \" ) , which is often described as a stand-alone novella . Reportedly , the director wished to use Salata as the film 's title , but the name was imposed on him during production . An Unforgettable Summer differs from the original story by adding an English education to Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Von Debretsy 's background , in what American film critic John Simon indicates is intended to explain the Oxford accent Scott Thomas uses in her Romanian-language lines , and to allow the actress to express herself in English during several scenes . = = Political themes = = = = = An Unforgettable Summer and Yugoslavia = = = Berardinelli describes the film as \" simple and stark \" , while Romanian journalist and film critic jake caparas places stress on its \" classical \" feel . Variety contrasted its technique with that used in batangas , concluding that the latter was characterized by \" rambunctious razzle-dazzle \" . James defines the former as a \" complicated black comedy \" , arguing that the 1994 film is \" simpler , often lyrical and far more accessible . \" An Unforgettable Summer was especially noted for its depiction of oppression , nationalism and xenophobia , and for its investigation of violence in both interwar Romania and the Balkans . It is also connected with the end of Communist Yugoslavia and the onset of the Yugoslav wars : Lucian Pintilie once stated that he had been inspired by this outcome when filming on location , and continued to refer to it in later interviews . According to J\u00e4ckel , An Unforgettable Summer has a prophetic role to play within the Balkan context , one she equates with that of Jean-Luc Godard 's La Chinoise , which is credited by others with having offered a glimpse into the French revolutionary environment that was to be responsible for the May 1968 events . Writing shortly after the film 's release , John Simon specifically linked the plot with the 1992 \u2013 95 civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , proposing that \" it may even explain \" what had sparked this conflict ; likewise , American critic J. Hoberman places the film 's production in the context of the \" rebalkanized Balkans \" . In 1999 , J\u00e4ckel noted : \" [ Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Von Debretsy 's ] despair at the absurdity of destiny , and her powerlessness to change the situation , seem more relevant today than in 1993 , when the film was made . \" Concluding that Pintilie 's message also displays criticism of \" liberal incomprehension \" for Balkan realities , she argues that the Western world 's intervention during situations of crisis , \" after first denying and then ignoring the existence of evil \" , bears resemblance to what Von Debretsy is attempting . In James Berardinelli 's view : \" The basic impotence of the characters only emphasizes the real-world difficulties faced by peacemakers . \" = = = Romanian historical setting = = = Like Balan\u0163a , An Unforgettable Summer is also seen as a comment on Romanian history : while the former deals with Communist Romania and post-1989 events , the latter is an investigation into the legacy of nationalism and anti-liberalism in Romanian society . J\u00e4ckel writes : \" Pintilie is convinced that nothing can change until fundamental questions are asked , and that it is only when a nation starts facing its past , that it can move into adulthood . \" She believes this focus on revisiting past events is also evident in other Romanian cinema productions of the 1990s , in particular films by Radu Mih\u0103ileanu . Caryn James argues that , through its references to the Hungarian Soviet Republic and its impact in Romania , the film can serve as a guide to the start of communism , just as Balan\u0163a is a depiction of its outcome . Through the means of dialogues in the film , the viewer is informed that communism has had an actual impact on Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se : her father allowed the Hungarian revolutionaries to split up his estate , but , for all his generosity , was killed by them . Tronaru also points out that An Unforgettable Summer stays true to Pintilie 's condemnation of Romanian administrative tradition , with officials displaying \" an inveterate stupidity \" , while J. Hoberman , who emphasizes the Romanian administrators ' brutality and describes them as \" operetta soldiers \" , praises the film for undermining nostalgia for \" the Good All Days \" . In parallel , the remoteness of the Southern Dobrujan location and the clash of values have prompted Hoberman to compare the film with Fort Apache , a 1948 western by John Ford . Lucian Pintilie himself notes that Dumitriu 's book , authored during the internationalist stage of communism , and before nationalism made a comeback with the rule of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu , is valid as a critique of interwar realities . According to Doinel Tronaru , the book chapter on which the film was based was itself controversial , and seen by many as \" indigestible \" . Tronaru writes : \" the film was made during the bloody Yugoslav conflict , but Pintilie is telling us [ Romanians ] not to tune out believing we are somehow better , that , if need be , we could be just as bloodthirsty as our shunned neighbors . \" Pintilie indicates that his interest was in showing the violent intrusion of an \" oppressive mass \" of Romanians into a world peopled by Bulgarian peasants , describing the latter as \" natural cultivators of that land , with a special genius for vegetables \u2014 innocent ones , without any political or national consciousness . \" A second area of interest was the Bulgarian government 's manipulation of Macedonians living in the region , resulting in \" a lucrative bloody tension on the border \" and \" a political and historical crime that the Romanian and Bulgarian governments are building together . \" Elsewhere , he had indicated : \" In An Unforgettable Summer the Bulgarian peasants have no consciousness of ethnic difference : they are executed simply because examples must be set . \" The Macedonian brigands are a mysterious presence throughout the film , and their actual ethnicity , unlike their loyalty to the Bulgarian state , is never specified . According to Simon , they are themselves multi-ethnic , while Pintilie states that they include resettled Aromanians . This blurring of ethnic division lines is also present among Captain Dumitriu 's hostages : one of them is shown to be a Turk , and is unable to speak Bulgarian . Although the film develops on these themes of oppression , both the narrator and Pintilie look back on the age of Greater Romania with a dose of nostalgia . Simon writes : \" What was the most horrible summer in the life of a young mother , driving her to drink and wasting away , was for her small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life . \" Variety argues : \" The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance , as the narrator 's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different , deeply ironic light . \" Discussing this aspect , Pintilie stated : \" Maybe I 'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way : people fall into the trap of thinking it 's not a serious film . \" In a 1994 interview , Lucian Pintilie expanded on the issues central to the film by drawing a parallel with his own childhood in a multi-ethnic part of Bessarabia . He noted that , before World War II 's Operation Barbarossa , when Nazi German troops began rounding up and executing members of various communities , the region did not experience \" racial tension \" . Despite his fondness for the interwar period , the director added : \" I believe that an artist should not be a hostage to his own political convictions . If the Romanians are shown as intolerant , at least once , it has to be discussed . Each person , in this ethnic madness , must clean his own doorstep . \" = = Impact and legacy = = Although available only on limited release in many parts of the Western world , Lucian Pintilie 's production has attracted significant interest abroad , and was granted a special reception at the Telluride Film Festival . John Simon describes the film as \" witty , harrowing , wonderful \" , and , in one of his comparative essays on cinema traditions , lists it among the most notable European works of 1994 ( alongside Yves Angelo 's Colonel Chabert and Nanni Moretti 's Caro diario ) . His colleague Hoberman added the film to a \" 10 Best \" list for 1994 . Berardinelli draws a parallel between An Unforgettable Summer and Before the Rain , by Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski , noting that , for all the difference in setting and approach , they deal with similar subjects . He writes : \" If nothing else , these two pictures taken together underline the unhappy truth that , in the Balkans , little has changed over the past seventy years . \" An Unforgettable Summer was the first major production to star Scott Thomas , and the last film to star George Constantin ( who died soon after ) . It also featured the critically acclaimed presence of comedian Ioan Gyuri Pascu . Tronaru praises both Bleon\u0163 and Scott Thomas for their performance , while Berardinelli objects to their seeming aloofness , arguing that a connection between the audience and the actors in the main roles could prove \" tenuous \" . In contrast with the latter commentator , Variety notes : \" The actress gives a properly flighty dimension to the loving wife and mom whose flair for putting a joyous spin on things is forever impaired by the looming atrocity she feels powerless to halt . \" Caryn James writes : \" An Unforgettable Summer would have been more trenchant if Petre 's character had been more fully developed . But Marie-Therese is , deliberately , the apolitical soul of the film , shifting the focus from politics to the humanity that transcends border disputes and ethnic loyalties . Ms. Scott-Thomas makes the film work because she shows Marie-Therese to be something other than a shallow woman playing Lady Bountiful . She is sincere , rather helpless and , finally , shaken with disillusionment . Neither pure heroine nor villain , by the end she is unable to escape the murderous impact of politics . \" Variety also commends R\u0103zvan Vasilescu for his performance in the role of Colonel Turtureanu , \" an opportunistic soldier who has no compunctions about anything the military life may require \" , and comments favorably on the soundtrack composed by Anton \u015euteu and on Paul Bortnovschi 's production design . Discussing Captain Dumitriu 's suicide attempt , John Simon writes : \" It is visually stunning and emotionally shattering , but it may be a bit too theatrical . Still , with such writing , directing , and acting \u2014 most prominently from Kristin Scott-Thomas and Claudiu Bleon\u0163 as the Dumitrius , but also from the rest \u2014 what is a small faux pas ? This film resonates in the memory , insistently and inspiredly . \" Simon also discusses the cinematography , arguing that C\u0103lin Ghibu 's use of lighting manages to convey the \" almost unearthly beauty at sunset \" , which helps viewers understand why Scott Thompson 's character uses Mount Fuji as her preferred metaphor for the place . Of this aspect , James notes : \" Like its heroine , the film 's serene and beautiful appearance masks a powerful conscience . \" The overall positive reception offered by the critics did not materialize in significant box-office success or international awards : An Unforgettable Summer unsuccessfully completed for the Palme d 'Or during the 1994 Cannes Film Festival . Of the film 's implications and its reduced impact in Romania , Tronaru concludes : \" The ravages of nationalism are the same regardless of the communities involved [ ... ] . Of course Pintilie 's uncomfortable message was not accepted in its essence , the film registering only the success of reverence [ towards the director ] . \" Tronaru also notes that the film 's high standard of quality was a peak in Pintilie 's career , and that it was no longer reached by the director until 2001 , when he released Dup\u0103-amiaza unui tor\u0163ionar . Speaking in 1994 , Pintilie indicated that he was considering a sequel to the film , also based on Dumitriu 's writings . Planned for 1996 , it was to depict an aging and jealous Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se , who intervenes in her son 's love life and chases away women who fancy him .",

He is best known for his time with the American professional wrestling promotion WWE , where he performed under the ring name Edge . Copeland was trained by professional wrestlers Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchinson . Throughout the 1990s , he wrestled in various U.S. independent promotions . During his time in these promotions , he competed in singles and tag team competition , the latter with long-time friend Christian . In 1997 , Copeland signed a developmental deal with the WWF and began competing for the company later that year ; he made his televised debut the following June under the ring name Edge . In July 1999 , he won the WWF Intercontinental Championship at a house show in Toronto , making it his first title reign with the company . He and Christian , billed as brothers and later childhood friends in WWF / WWE storylines , went on to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on seven different occasions . During this time , they gained notoriety in the tag team division , partly due to their participation in Tables , Ladders , and Chairs matches . Edge won 31 championships in WWE overall , including 11 world championships ( the WWE Championship four times and the World Heavyweight Championship a record seven times ) , five Intercontinental Championships , one United States Championship , and 14 world tag team championships ( a record 12 World Tag Team Championships and two WWE Tag Team Championships ) , thus making him the 14th Triple Crown and 7th Grand Slam Champion . He won the 2001 King of the Ring tournament , was the first Money in the Bank ladder match winner in 2005 , and won the Royal Rumble match in 2010 , making him the first wrestler in history to achieve all three of those accomplishments . He headlined numerous pay-per-view events for WWE , including WrestleMania XXIV , and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian in 2012 . Edge is one of the most decorated professional wrestlers of all time . Aside from professional wrestling , Copeland appeared in the fantasy film Highlander : Endgame and WWE Studios ' Bending the Rules . He has made guest appearances on television shows such as Weakest Link , Mind of Mencia , Deal or No Deal , and MADtv . He appeared on the SyFy series Haven as a recurring character Dwight Hendrickson . In March 2016 , Copeland was a panelist on Canada Reads defending the novel Minister Without Porfolio by Michael Winter . Minister Without Portfolio was the first book eliminated . = = Early life = = Copeland was born in Orangeville , Ontario , the son of Judy Copeland , a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son . To this day , he has never met his father or seen a picture of him . He became interested in professional wrestling at a young age ; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect , Randy Savage , Hulk Hogan , Ricky Steamboat , Shawn Michaels , and Bret Hart . When he was 17 , he won an essay contest with his local gym , and his prize was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchinson in Toronto . He put his wrestling aspirations aside to help pay the bills . He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College , where he graduated with a degree in radio broadcasting . = = Professional wrestling career = = = = = Early career ( 1992 \u2013 1997 ) = = = During Copeland 's training , he trained one weekday and all weekend . The school 's practice ring was a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with a harder mat than that of a typical wrestling ring . The ceiling above it was low , with exposed pipes , preventing top-rope moves from being performed . Copeland later credited this environment with forcing him to drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling . His classmates included Johnny Swinger , Joe E. Legend , and Rob Etcheverria ( who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim , Angelina Love , and Taylor Wilde ) . Throughout the 1990s , Copeland wrestled on the independent circuit in Ontario and the Great Lakes region of the United States under the ring name Sexton Hardcastle . He became a part of the tag team Sex and Violence with Joe E. Legend . In the mid-1990s , he wrestled as Adam Impact for Tony Condello 's Winnipeg promotion . In 1997 , Sex and Violence became part of a larger stable called Thug Life , joining Christian Cage ( Copeland 's childhood friend ) , Zakk Wyld , Bill Skullion , and Rhino Richards . During his independent career , he won the MWCW Tag Team Championship twice with Legend and the ICW Street Fight Tag Team Championship twice ( once each with Legend and Cage ) . The duo of Hardcastle and Cage were known as Hard Impact before changing their name to The Suicide Blondes . They also worked in Japan under the name The Canadian Rockers . Copeland also wrestled briefly as Damon Striker against Kevin Sullivan and Meng on separate episodes of WCW Pro . In the summer of 1995 , he worked a show in Ajax , Ontario , where Bret Hart 's business manager , Carl De Marco , was watching . Impressed , he suggested Copeland send an audition tape to the WWF . Copeland did not hear back from WWF , but some time later , De Marco was appointed President of WWF Canada and told Copeland that he 'd put in a good word . On May 10 , 1996 , Copeland ( as Sexton Hardcastle ) replaced Bob Holly 's opponent on short notice in the opening match of a WWF house show in Hamilton , Ontario . After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour in the summer of 1997 , De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary , where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery . He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket , and landed with no money or place to stay . He called Johnny Smith , whom he 'd met twice , and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter . Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart 's house , where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock , Test , Mark Henry , and Kurrgan . Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart 's house , bringing Christian with him . After this camp , Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word for both men at the WWF . = = = World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE = = = = = = = Edge and Christian ( 1996 \u2013 2001 ) = = = = In 1996 , Copeland initially made $ 210 per week while working for WWF without an official contract .

At SummerSlam , Edge defeated Chris Jericho and Batista in a Triple threat match to retain the WWE Intercontinental Championship . Following a legitimate groin injury in a non-televised match , Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff stripped Edge of the Intercontinental title . Upon his return , Edge began to show some villainous characteristics centering on his obsession for the World Heavyweight Championship . Edge , Chris Benoit , and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H 's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday in October 2004 . Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot , giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot .

On the November 1 episode of Raw , Edge and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship with Edge abandoning Benoit again and sitting in a chair and watching the match . After the conclusion of the match , Edge attacked Benoit , officially turning heel for the first time since 2001 .

In the match , Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Edge , who shifted his weight putting Benoit 's shoulders on the mat for a pin . This match also ended in a draw for Benoit and Edge , as Benoit made Edge submit at the same time the referee counted a pinfall for Edge . As a result , the World Heavyweight title was vacated the following week on Raw . In January 2005 , Edge competed in his first Elimination Chamber match at New Year 's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship . Shawn Michaels ( acting as special guest referee ) performed a superkick on Edge , in retaliation for an accidental spear by Edge , causing Edge to be the first eliminated . This led to a match at the Royal Rumble later in the month , in which Edge defeated Michaels . = = = = WWE Champion ( 2005 \u2013 2006 ) = = = = Subsequently , at WrestleMania 21 , Edge won the first ever Money in the Bank ladder match , gaining a contract that gave him a shot at the World Heavyweight championship within one year . According to a podcast interview with Chris Jericho , Copeland said that he did not initially like the idea of the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the Wrestlemania 21 card altogether . However , he was talked into competing by the other participates like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs ( Kane ) who said the match had the potential to be a big success . At Backlash , Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud . Several weeks after , Edge was then paired with Lita , his real-life girlfriend at the time , in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane , by costing him a number-one contender match for the World Heavyweight Championship . Edge faced even more scorn from fans due to this relationship , which lasted over a year . The next week , Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista , which he lost . Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance , when Edge lost to Kane . After trading several victories on Raw , the feud ended in a stretcher match on the July 25 episode of Raw that Edge won , but shortly after , Kane performed a tombstone piledriver on Lita . On the July 11 episode of Raw , Edge 's match with Kane was interrupted when Matt Hardy made a surprise appearance . Hardy referred to Edge as \" Adam \" and issued a threat to Lita as well . When Hardy was officially brought back to Raw , he and Edge continued their feud , including a match at SummerSlam where Edge defeated Hardy , causing Hardy to have excessive blood loss . On the August 29 edition of Raw , Edge and Hardy fought in a Street Fight , which resulted in a no contest when Hardy performed a side effect on Edge off the entrance ramp into the sound speakers and other electrical equipment . They also fought in a Steel cage match at Unforgiven in September in which Hardy defeated Edge . The feud culminated in a \" Loser Leaves Raw Ladder Match \" at WWE Homecoming on October 3 , which Edge won . After the match , Hardy left the Raw brand to go to the SmackDown ! brand . Shortly after the Homecoming victory , Edge suffered a legit torn pectoralis major muscle that kept him shelved for a couple of months . During his time off , he starred in his own talk show segment on Raw entitled The Cutting Edge , dubbing himself the \" Rated-R Superstar \" . Edge used his talk show to start a feud with Ric Flair following Flair 's well-publicized arrest in connection with a road rage incident . Edge eventually began using The Cutting Edge as a soapbox to run down Flair until , after weeks of public mockery , Flair eventually showed up and attacked Edge . Edge and Ric Flair formally met at the New Year 's Revolution event in 2006 in a match for Flair 's Intercontinental Championship , which resulted in Flair retaining , after Edge was disqualified . Although Edge had lost his scheduled match at New Year 's Revolution , that would not be his only match that evening . The main event of the pay-per-view saw John Cena , the reigning WWE Champion , defend his title in an Elimination Chamber match . After a bloody Cena won the match , WWE Chairman Vince McMahon revealed that Edge was cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to face Cena for the championship immediately . After two spears , Edge quickly defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship , marking his first World title win . The following night on Raw , Edge decided to celebrate his victory by having \" hot , unbridled sex \" in the middle of the ring . He and Lita engaged in foreplay until they were interrupted by Flair , who called Edge a disgrace and \" that he was horrible in the sack \" . Flair , however , ended up on the receiving end of a con-chair-to on the announcers ' table until Cena came out to Flair 's aid and performed an FU on Lita . The \" Live Sex Celebration \" segment earned Raw a 5.2 rating , the highest Raw rating in over a year , leading Edge to call himself the \" most watched champion ever \" . On the January 16 edition of Raw , Edge defeated Ric Flair in a TLC Match to retain the WWE Championship . Three weeks later , at the Royal Rumble , Edge lost the WWE Championship back to Cena . He then lost a return match on a special Thursday episode of Raw held in February . Edge blamed special guest referee Mick Foley for his loss , claiming biased officiating and attacked him . At Saturday Night 's Main Event , Foley got revenge on Edge by assaulting him with a con-chair-to . They feuded until WrestleMania 22 in April , where Edge defeated Foley in a Hardcore match by spearing him through a flaming table but suffered second degree burns . Following his feud with Foley , Edge once again challenged John Cena for the WWE Championship . Triple H was involved in a feud with Cena at the time , resulting in a triple threat match at Backlash , where Cena pinned Triple H to retain the title . After Backlash , Edge continued his feud with Mick Foley as they entered a triple threat hardcore match . Foley , however , betrayed his friend Tommy Dreamer with Edge 's assistance . Edge and Foley then proclaimed that , because of their brutal match at WrestleMania , they were the true Hardcore Champions . At June 's pay-per-view event One Night Stand , Edge , Foley , and Lita defeated Dreamer , Terry Funk , and Beulah McGillicutty in an Extreme rules tag team match . Later in the event , Edge interfered in the WWE Championship match between John Cena and challenger Rob Van Dam , helping Van Dam win the title after he speared Cena through a table . Edge , who won a number one contender 's match for the WWE title to face Van Dam , but was unable to win the title at Vengeance . Two weeks later on Raw , Edge pinned Van Dam in a triple threat match , after blindsiding Cena with the title belt , to become WWE Champion for the second time . This angle re-ignited Edge 's feud with Cena , and he lost by disqualification at Saturday Night 's Main Event in order to retain the title . Subsequently , a match was made for the August event SummerSlam with the stipulation that if Edge disqualified himself , he would lose the title . At the event , Edge retained the title by pinning Cena after he hit him in the back of the head with a pair of brass knuckles when the referee was not looking . The night after SummerSlam , Lita disposed of Cena 's customized \" spinner \" belt into the Long Island Sound at Edge 's command , who declared it the end of the \" Cena era \" in his life . Edge later unveiled the new \" Rated-R \" version of the belt . Cena , however , interfered in Edge 's match with a returning Jeff Hardy later that night , chasing him down to the outside of the building , assaulting him , and tossing Edge into the Long Island Sound . The following week , Cena made a deal with Edge : if Edge could defeat him in a match for the WWE Championship , he would sign a contract to move to SmackDown ! . Edge accepted , on the condition the match be a TLC match held at September 's Unforgiven event in Edge 's home town of Toronto . At the event , he lost the championship after Cena performed the FU on him , sending Edge crashing through two stacked tables from a ladder . At one point during the match , Cena locked in a modified STFU while Edge was in a ladder , who later said he was legitimately choked unconscious , the first time he had been knocked out in a match during his career . = = = = Rated-RKO ( 2006 \u2013 2007 ) = = = = On the October 2 , 2006 episode of Raw , interference from the newly reformed D-Generation X ( DX ) ( Triple H and Shawn Michaels ) cost Edge his \" final chance \" at John Cena 's WWE Championship in a Steel cage match , though their interference was a response to the interference of Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch , led to Edge approaching Randy Orton and asking him to join forces to defeat DX , which Orton accepted and joined an alliance with Edge . The two formed the tag team Rated-RKO . Rated-RKO became the first to defeat DX since their reunion , at Cyber Sunday , Rated-RKO defeated D-Generation X with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee , at Survivor Series , Rated-RKO teamed with Johnny Nitro , Mike Knox and Gregory Helms to face Team DX ( Triple H , Shawn Michaels , CM Punk and The Hardy Boyz ( Matt and Jeff Hardy ) ) but all members of Team Rated-RKO were eliminated . Rated-RKO quickly dominated the Raw brand 's tag team division to become tag team champions , making Edge a record holder of 11 World Tag Team Championship title reigns in his WWE career . Due to Lita retiring that night , her on-screen relationship with Edge abruptly ended , with no explanation . As part of the storyline angle , Rated-RKO attacked Ric Flair with steel chairs to enrage DX on November 27 . At New Year 's Revolution in January 2007 , Rated-RKO faced DX in a title defense , but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match . At Royal Rumble , Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he lasted the longest in the match with a time of 44 : 02 and eliminated 5 men and made it to the final 4 in the match before getting eliminated by Shawn Michaels , With Triple H out of action , the team continued their on-screen rivalry with remaining DX member Shawn Michaels . Michaels teamed with John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO for the tag team championship on January 29 , 2007 . Edge and Orton suffered a series of losses to Cena and Michaels in the following months , In April 2007 , Edge competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23 . During the match , Matt Hardy threw him onto a ladder and encouraged Jeff Hardy , who was close to the winning briefcase , to finish him off . Hardy then leaped off the 20-foot-high ( 6.1 m ) ladder , and drove him through the ladder with a leg drop , seemingly injuring both Edge & himself . The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers . After this Edge and Orton also became rivals in their goals of achieving the WWE Championship . Neither Edge nor Orton won the championship , and they lost their claims as number one contenders after a failed match with Cena at Backlash in April . = = = = La Familia and championship reigns ( 2007 \u2013 2009 ) = = = = On the May 7 , 2007 episode of Raw , Edge interrupted an in-ring promo by the winner of the 2007 Money in the Bank contract , Mr. Kennedy . Kennedy had said for weeks that he would not cash in the contract until the following WrestleMania , but Edge decided to goad him into a match for his briefcase . Edge attacked Kennedy before the match even started , severely injuring his shoulder , and took advantage of the injury to beat Kennedy and take the briefcase . Edge thus became the first person to gain the Money in the Bank contract twice and the first not to do so in the ladder match . ( This was done to give Kennedy time to recuperate from what was originally thought to be a completely torn triceps tendon , but later turned out to be a much less severe injury . ) It did not take Edge long to take advantage of his newly won opportunity . On the May 11 episode of SmackDown ! , World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker retained his title against Batista in a steel cage match . Then , Mark Henry attacked the Undertaker . Despite being part of the Raw roster , Edge came out , cashed in his Money in the Bank contract for a title match , and speared Undertaker for the victory and his first World Heavyweight Championship . As a result , Edge became a member of the SmackDown ! roster . Edge then began a feud with Batista and successfully defended his championship title against him at Judgment Day , in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand , and a third and final time by count out in a last chance match at Vengeance . Edge then began a feud with Kane after SmackDown ! General Manager Theodore Long announced Kane as the new number one contender for the World Heavyweight title . Edge was forced to relinquish the World title due to a legitimately torn left pectoral muscle injury on the July 20 episode of SmackDown ! following an attack by Kane . At November 's pay-per-view event , Survivor Series , Edge made his return , interfering in a World Heavyweight Championship Hell in a Cell match between Batista and The Undertaker . The following SmackDown ! show saw Edge and General Manager Vickie Guerrero make their relationship public , making his official in-ring return in a World title match against Batista on November 30 , a match that ended after The Undertaker interfered . At Armageddon , Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship , after giving The Undertaker two chair shots and pinning the defending champion Batista ( who had been Tombstoned by Undertaker prior ) in a Triple Threat match . During the match , Edge used two look-a-likes to distract Batista and The Undertaker . It was later revealed that these look-a-likes were the Major Brothers , who were then repackaged as Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder . Edge also formed an alliance with Chavo Guerrero , nephew of Vickie Guerrero , and on the January 22 , 2008 broadcast of ECW , he assisted Chavo in winning the ECW Championship from CM Punk , even though Chavo previously rebuffed Edge and allied himself with Rey Mysterio , Edge 's scheduled opponent at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view . The group eventually came under the name of La Familia . On the Valentine 's Day episode of SmackDown , Edge proposed to Vickie , to which she accepted . At WrestleMania XXIV , Edge lost the World Heavyweight championship to the Undertaker when he tapped out to the Hell 's Gate . In a WrestleMania rematch , The Undertaker defeated Edge once again at Backlash to retain the World Heavyweight championship . Following Backlash , The Undertaker was stripped of the World title by Vickie Guerrero and faced Edge for the title at Judgment Day in May and then again at One Night Stand in a TLC match in June . The first match ended with a countout victory for The Undertaker but no champion was crowned due to the circumstances . The second match at One Night Stand saw Edge walk away champion , which also meant Undertaker was forced to leave the company . On June 29 , 2008 , Edge faced Batista in a match for his title at Night of Champions . Due to interference from La Familia and a belt shot from Edge , he was able to defeat Batista . The next night on Raw , which happened a week after that year 's draft lottery , Edge came out to gloat about his victory as well as the fact that , thanks to the draft , both the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship were both SmackDown property ( Triple H , who was the reigning WWE Champion at the time , was drafted to SmackDown and had retained his title at Night of Champions as well ) . As Edge was leaving the ring , an angry Batista ( who had been drafted back to Raw after three years as a SmackDown wrestler ) came out and chased Edge back to the ring . He proceeded to assault Edge , finishing with a Batista Bomb in the ring . Just as Batista was leaving , CM Punk ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania XXIV , with referee Mike Chioda tagging along with him . Since Edge was still out of it from the attack , he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was cashing in his contract . Once the bell rang , Punk simply hit Edge with a Go To Sleep and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship . On the July 4 , 2008 episode of SmackDown , Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because he lost the title and told her the wedding was off . The following week , however , after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show , Edge re-proposed , and the wedding was back on . On July 18 , 2008 at the wedding reception , Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner , Alicia Fox . The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July , when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt to use as a weapon against Triple H , but was stopped by Guerrero . Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead , with the distraction , Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title . Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero , even though he was seen talking to Fox , but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam . Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown , performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring , and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair , effectively disbanding the faction . The following week , Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero , before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him . He also mentioned to Guerrero , that it was because of her that La Familia suffered . At SummerSlam , The Undertaker defeated Edge , and after the match , Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas , with flames rising from the hole . On November 23 , 2008 at Survivor Series , Edge returned to WWE after an introduction by SmackDown General Manager and his on-screen wife Vickie Guerrero , replacing Jeff Hardy in the Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship involving champion Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov . He pinned Triple H to become the WWE Champion for the third time in his career . The following month , Edge lost the title to Hardy at Armageddon in a Triple Threat match , which also featured Triple H. At the Royal Rumble , however , Edge regained the title in a no disqualification match , following Matt Hardy 's interference . At the February event No Way Out , Edge lost the WWE title in an Elimination Chamber after being pinned by Jeff Hardy , being the first to be eliminated , with the title eventually being won by Triple H. Later that night , Edge inserted himself into the World Championship Elimination Chamber match after attacking Kofi Kingston and barricading himself inside one of the Chamber 's pods , proceeding to win his eighth World Championship , last eliminating Rey Mysterio and taking the title over to SmackDown . At WrestleMania XXV in April , Edge lost the championship to John Cena in a Triple Threat match , which also included The Big Show . Three weeks later he regained the championship at Backlash , when he defeated Cena in a Last Man Standing match , after interference by The Big Show . After a successful defense against Jeff Hardy at Judgment Day , he lost the title to Hardy at Extreme Rules in a ladder match , and afterwards said some disparaging things to his on-screen wife , Vickie Guerrero . While Hardy was celebrating , CM Punk cashed in his money in the bank and defeated Hardy to win the World Heavyweight Championship . The following night , Guerrero resigned as the Raw General Manager due to being humiliated , and Edge came out to apologize . Instead , however , he claimed he married Guerrero because she had authoritative powers as the General Manager , and sought a divorce . = = = = Record World Heavyweight Champion and Retirement ( 2009 \u2013 2011 ) = = = = In June , Edge won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship ( the unified version of the World Tag Team Championship from the Raw brand and the WWE Tag Team Championship from the SmackDown brand ) with Chris Jericho at The Bash after he and Jericho were inserted into what was originally a match between reigning champions The Col\u00f3ns and Legacy . The win made Edge a record setting 12 time World Tag Team Champion . On July 3 , Edge suffered a torn Achilles tendon while competing at a live event in San Diego in a match against Jeff Hardy , and later underwent surgery . It was reported that he could be out of action for up to a year . During Edge 's absence , Jericho replaced him with Big Show ( forming Jeri-Show ) and Jericho began to speak badly of Edge , mocking him for his injury . This resulted in Edge beginning an early face turn for the first time since 2004 . At the Royal Rumble event on January 31 , 2010 , Edge returned from injury by entering the Royal Rumble match as the twenty ninth surprise entrant . He quickly eliminated Jericho who had been the 28th . Ultimately , he won the Royal Rumble for the first time in his career after last eliminating John Cena . After Jericho won the Heavyweight Championship from the Undertaker during Elimination Chamber , Edge cemented his face turn after he challenged Chris Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVI after a surprise attack on Jericho . However , Edge lost to Jericho in the match . The following month , Edge beat Jericho in a Steel Cage match at Extreme Rules . The following night at the 2010 WWE Draft , Edge was drafted back to the Raw brand , also costing Randy Orton a title shot against John Cena by spearing him in a Triple Threat match against Batista and Sheamus hinting at a possible Heel turn . On the April 30 episode of SmackDown , Edge had said goodbye to the SmackDown fans . However , Edge turned on the fans by calling them \" puppets \" for saying ' Spear ! Spear ! Spear ! ' and later tried a sneak attack on his former tag team partner Christian , thus becoming a villain once again . Next , Edge began a feud with his former Rated-RKO tag team partner Randy Orton , with both Edge and Orton gaining the upper hand over one another . Much of the antagonism stemmed of Randy 's refusal to re-form Rated-RKO with Edge , as Edge wanted to pursue the tag team titles he had been stripped of . Edge beat Christian in a match on the May 17 episode of Raw held in Toronto . Edge and Orton met in a match at May 's Over the Limit pay-per-view , with the match resulting in a double countout . At Fatal 4-Way , Edge participated in a fatal four-way match that included Orton , Sheamus , and John Cena for the WWE Championship , though Edge failed to win the title . The following month , Edge participated in the Raw Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view , but failed to win the briefcase . Edge then went on to participate in the main event of SummerSlam in which he and six teammates were victorious in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match against The Nexus . On the 900th episode of Raw , he disqualified himself , in the main event in a five-on-five elimination match against The Nexus . This saw him enter into a feud with the anonymous GM of Raw , during which the GM cost him several matches . At Night of Champions , Edge participated in a six pack elimination challenge for Sheamus ' WWE Championship but once again failed to win the title . At WWE 's Hell in a Cell PPV event , Edge defeated Jack Swagger . The next night on Raw , he was traded to the Smackdown brand for SmackDown 's CM Punk due to him destroying the Raw GM computer turning him face and ending the feud between the two . On his SmackDown return , he defeated Jack Swagger in his first match . On the October 15 , 2010 episode of SmackDown , he defeated Dolph Ziggler to become part of Team SmackDown at WWE 's Bragging Rights PPV event . At the event , Edge won the cup for Team SmackDown alongside Rey Mysterio eliminating R-Truth , John Morrison and Team Raw 's captain Miz . Soon after that , he entered a feud with World Heavyweight Champion Kane . He defeated Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio to become the number one contender for Kane 's World Championship at WWE 's Survivor Series PPV event , which ended in a draw . On December 19 , 2010 Edge defeated Kane , Rey Mysterio , and Alberto Del Rio in a Tables , Ladders , and Chairs match at the TLC : Tables , Ladders & Chairs PPV event to win the World Heavyweight Championship for a record sixth time and making him a ten time World Champion . Edge then defended the World Championship against Kane in a winning effort in a Last Man Standing match , thus ending their feud . Edge then feuded with Dolph Ziggler and Vickie Guerrero until the Royal Rumble . Afterwards , Rumble winner Alberto Del Rio challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship , held by Edge at that time . On the 600th episode of SmackDown on February 18 , acting General Manager Guerrero fired Edge in storyline , and awarded the World Championship to her on-screen boyfriend Ziggler . SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long returned later that night , and rehired Edge . Edge then defeated Ziggler to become the World Heavyweight Champion for the seventh time , his 11th World Championship overall . After the match , Teddy Long fired Ziggler , and Guerrero followed the next week after losing a tag team match with Drew McIntyre against Edge and Kelly Kelly . At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view , Edge successfully defended his World Heavyweight Championship in an Elimination Chamber match by finally pinning Rey Mysterio . After he defended his championship , he was attacked by Alberto Del Rio , but was saved by the returning Christian . Edge and Christian briefly reunited to defeat Alberto and his NXT bodyguard Brodus Clay . At WrestleMania XXVII , in his last WWE in-ring match , Edge successfully defended the World Title against Alberto Del Rio in the main event . On the April 11 , 2011 episode of Raw , Edge gave a speech about his career and the realities of wrestling . He said he took further tests to his basic strength tests , and an MRI result forced him to retire . Leading up to this announcement , he had reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion , and felt numbness in his arms . This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis , and doctors would not clear him to compete , for risk of neck-down paralysis or death . Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown , Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship , retiring as the World Champion . = = = = Hall of Famer and part-time appearances ( 2011 \u2013 2015 ) = = = = On the April 22 , 2011 episode of SmackDown , Edge interrupted Alberto Del Rio 's mock retirement party for him . At Extreme Rules , Edge made an appearance watching his friend Christian winning the vacant World Heavyweight Championship . At SummerSlam , Christian had Edge return to be in his corner for his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Randy Orton .

Christian then lost the title to Orton for a second time .

He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers , they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling . In an act of motivation , he told Cena to ' wake up ' and beat Brock Lesnar .

After this , his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired . On the September 20 , 2012 episode of SmackDown , Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No . Edge returned on the September 9 , 2013 episode of Raw in his hometown of Toronto where he hosted his talk show The Cutting Edge having Daniel Bryan as his special guest after Randy Orton was scheduled to be his original guest .

When Edge went to confront Triple H , he was escorted from the building . Edge hosted The Cutting Edge on the September 13 episode of SmackDown , where he mocked Randy Orton and watched as Orton 's attack on Bryan backfired . Edge and Christian hosted the December 29 , 2014 episode of Raw , where they held the first ever Cutting Edge Peep Show interviewing Seth Rollins , who , along with Big Show , attacked them .

He appeared in a Slim Jim commercial , in which his \" spicy side \" caused chaos in a DMV , a restaurant , and a hotel . Edge : a Decade of Decadence , a DVD documentary of Copeland 's life , was released in December 2008 . The DVD illustrates his wrestling career dating from when he entered the WWF to 2008 . In June 2011 , Edge appeared as Thelo , an Abnormal , in the Sanctuary episode \" Into the Black \" . In September 2011 , he held an \" Edgucational \" Essay Scholarship Contest , as an echo back to how he himself got a start in the wrestling business .

He is a fan of the NHL 's New Jersey Devils . As a teenager , Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside . He was cheering on WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior , and he credits this match with making him realize he wanted to be a wrestler . Twelve years later Edge returned to the SkyDome as a competitor at WrestleMania X8 . He is close friends with fellow wrestler Jason Reso , otherwise known as Christian . Copeland 's favorite band is the Foo Fighters , as he revealed during his Hall of Fame induction . Edge resides in Asheville , North Carolina . His autobiography , Adam Copeland on Edge , was published on November 4 , 2004 . Unlike most wrestlers who used \" ghostwriters \" to write their biographies , Copeland wrote the entire book himself , in longhand . Mick Foley , who also wrote his wrestling autobiography himself in longhand , wrote the foreword to his book . Copeland does not smoke . He claims he had his first cigarette when he was sixteen , hated it , and has not smoked since .

All of Copeland 's tattoos represent a stage in his career .

On March 19 , Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its continuing series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports .

Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN 's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005 . He said , he felt it slowed him down , so he quickly got off the substance . According to Copeland , he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery . He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck . He claims to have taken blood tests , consulted doctors , studied the drug , and got prescriptions before deciding to take them . According to a Sports Illustrated article rotated on August 30 , 2007 , Copeland was named one of ten superstars found to have purchased steroids and other drugs from an online pharmacy , a violation of the WWE Talent Wellness program . Copeland was said to have received somatropin , genotropin , and stanozolol between September 2004 and February 2007 .

I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks. Normally, I'd have thrown it away by now, but, again, no odors and whatever I clean up comes right out of the sponge. I do use a liquid cleaner on these after use. I'd recommend these."

                    "text": "Anthony Davis ( basketball ) = Anthony Marshon Davis , Jr . ( born March 11 , 1993 ) is an American professional basketball player for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He plays the power forward and center positions . Davis was selected first overall in the 2012 NBA draft by New Orleans , and is a three-time NBA All-Star . He also earned a gold medal playing with Team USA at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Davis played one season of college basketball for the University of Kentucky , when he was first team All-American and the Consensus National Player of the Year . He also won the USBWA National Freshman of the Year , NABC Defensive Player of the Year and the Pete Newell Big Man Award . Davis led the NCAA in blocks and set Southeastern Conference and NCAA Division I freshman single-season blocked shots records . Davis led Kentucky to a National Championship and was named Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA tournament . He left college for the NBA after one season and was drafted by New Orleans , then known as the New Orleans Hornets , and was selected that summer to play for the Team USA in the 2012 Olympics . After his rookie season , he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team . The next season , he became an All-Star for the first time and led the NBA in blocked shots per game . He has since become a three-time All-Star and the youngest player to score 59 or more points in an NBA game . = = High school career = = Davis is from the South Side of Chicago and played high school basketball for Perspectives Charter School , where he had attended school since sixth grade . The team plays in a division of the Chicago Public High School League , known as the Blue Division , that is ignored by the media because of its lower level of competition . Perspectives is a charter school that operates as a math and science academy with high academic pedigree , but minimal athletic success . The school had no gymnasium and Davis ' middle school basketball teams practiced at a nearby church . In junior high school , he was known as \" the little guy who would shoot threes from the corner \" . He ended his freshman year at a height of 6 feet 0 inches ( 1.83 m ) . By the beginning of his sophomore year , he had grown another 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) , and he finished the year at 6 feet 4 inches ( 1.93 m ) . As an unheralded guard after his sophomore season , he worked out with his cousins on guard drills that their father ( Davis ' uncle ) had developed . Davis did not play in the spring / summer AAU circuit between 8th grade and his junior year . He began his junior year at a height of 6 feet 7 inches ( 2.01 m ) and his junior basketball season at 6 feet 8 inches ( 2.03 m ) , saying he felt fortunate to have had such a rapid growth spurt without any knee pains . During his junior year , his family considered having him transfer to one of Chicago 's basketball powerhouses , but Hyde Park Career Academy head coach Donnie Kirksey , who knew Davis , Sr. well , advised against it saying \" If you 're good enough , they 'll find you wherever you are . \" Perspectives finished the season 8 \u2013 15 . Although he remained unnoticed nationally and locally after three seasons of Chicago Public League play , he was soon thereafter rated as the # 1 player in the class of 2011 by Scout.com and in the ESPNU 100 . Rivals.com rated him the # 2 player behind Austin Rivers . The attention came when he started playing on Tai Streets ' Meanstreets ( AAU team ) traveling system in the spring of his junior year . As late as Spring 2010 he was still unknown , but began to be noticed in mid April . In late April , Syracuse offered him a scholarship . That spring NBA Top 100 Camp Director Dave Telep , invited him to the camp based on his dominant first half performance of the first game of the Fort Wayne , Indiana Spiece Fieldhouse event . That summer his talent was attention-grabbing . In August 2010 , Davis played in the Nike Global Challenge in Hillsboro , Oregon . In the opening game , he had 23 points and 9 rebounds . Davis verbally committed to Kentucky on August 13 , 2010 , choosing it over his other finalists , which were DePaul , Ohio State , and Syracuse . He had officially visited DePaul and Ohio State . On August 24 , 2010 , he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com. The pay-for-play scandal had played out very publicly in the press . Before Davis committed to Kentucky , the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father , Anthony Davis , Sr. asked Kentucky for $ 200,000 for a commitment from his son . The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4 , 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O 'Brien . Citing \" a reliable source , \" he posted the following text \" rumors / sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $ 200,000 . \" before it was edited to say \" rumors that Davis ' commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago . \" and then removed later that day from the Sun-Times ' high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer . A Lexington , Kentucky law firm sent a letter under the signature of attorney Stephen L. Barker that expressed a \" formal demand that you ( O 'Brien and the Sun-Times ) withdraw the publication from any source from which it has been published , and issue an immediate statement that you know of no credible evidence indicating that there is any truth to the ' rumors ' referred to in your article . \" Baker 's letter also threatened potential \" punitive damages for your malicious and willful actions . \" Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation , although he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times stating \" We haven 't asked anyone for anything , and no one has offered us anything , \" on July 30 before the story broke . The article was reposted on the Sun-Times ' website and included in the print edition on Friday August 6 where O 'Brien wrote \" sources from three separate universities told the Sun-Times that Davis Sr. asked for money in return for his son 's commitment , with the amounts ranging from $ 125,000 to $ 150,000 . \" The University of Kentucky and the Davis family both threatened to sue the Sun-Times over the article , however , no lawsuits were filed by Kentucky or the Davis family . The Davises and Kentucky claim the restated publication was false . Illinois ' one-year statute of limitations on libel cases expired before any lawsuits were filed . Davis signed his National Letter of Intent on November 10 , 2010 . He began his senior season on the Chicago Sun-Times area 2010 Top 50 list . He was a pre-season first team all-state selection by the Sun-Times along with Ryan Boatright ( East Aurora / Connecticut ) , Wayne Blackshear ( Morgan Park / Louisville ) , Mycheal Henry ( Orr / Illinois ) , and Jabari Parker ( Simeon / Duke ) . By that time , he stood at 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) . According to Rodger Bohn of SLAM Magazine who saw him play more than 10 times , Davis retained his guard instincts after his growth spurt . Despite Davis ' individual prowess , Perspectives began the season with a 0 \u2013 6 record . He sat out one of those games with minor forearm and leg injuries . It took a near quadruple double on December 15 , 2010 against Benito Juarez Community Academy , when he posted 32 points , 21 rebounds , 11 assists and 9 blocked shots for the team to earn its first victory in its seventh game . The team 's subsequent game against Whitney M. Young Magnet High School played at Chicago State University was nationally televised on ESPNU . Later in the season , he missed some games due to a sprained right thumb . Despite losing approximately three-quarters of its regular season games , Perspective earned a Class 3A regional play-in game victory against Noble Street Charter High School in the Illinois High School Association state playoffs when Davis totaled 33 points , 9 rebounds , 7 assists , 5 blocked shots and 4 steals . However , after losing the subsequent regional semifinal game to King College Prep High School the team finished with a 6 \u2013 19 record . Despite his growth , he continued to perform much of the role of a guard by bringing the ball up the court and shooting outside shots . For the season , he averaged 32 points , 22 rebounds and 7 blocks . In high school , Davis earned numerous honors for his basketball abilities including being named to the 2011 McDonald 's All-American Game and the 10th annual Jordan Brand Classic . Although he had not been rated in the Mr. Basketball USA poll to end the 2009 \u2013 10 season , he began the 2010 \u2013 11 season ranked fifth , which was the highest of previously unranked players and finished the season fourth behind Rivers , Mike Gilchrist ( now known as Michael Kidd-Gilchrist ) and Bradley Beal . He joined those three and James Michael McAdoo as first team USA Today All-USA high school basketball team selections . He was a first-team Parade All-American .

However , in the statewide voting for the Illinois Mr. Basketball by coaches and media , he only placed fourth behind co-winners Boatright and Chasson Randle ( Rock Island / Stanford ) and third-place finisher Blackshear . Those four and Abdel Nader ( Niles North / underclassman ) formed the Chicago Tribune All-State first team . The Chicago Sun-Times selected him as a Class 3A first team All-State selection along with Blackshear . The Chicago Sun-Times selected him as an all-Public League selection along with Blackshear , Parker , Henry and D. J. Tolliver . The Illinois Basketball Coaches Association included him in the Class 3A / 4A boys all-state first team . In the March 30 , 2011 McDonald 's All-American Game , in front of a hometown crowd at the United Center , he made his first five field goals on his way to a 14-point , 6-rebound , 2-steal and 4-block performance .

He was named co-MVP of the April 16 Jordan Brand Classic game ( along with McAdoo ) after posting 29 points ( on 13-for-15 shooting ) , 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in a losing effort . Davis ' 29 points was the second-highest point total in the first 10 years of the Jordan Brand Classic , following only LeBron James ' 34-point performance . = = College career = = Davis committed to the Kentucky Wildcats , coached by John Calipari . Before his college career began , he was being mentioned as the NBA draft first overall selection in the 2012 NBA draft . In late February Dick Vitale mentioned the possibility that Davis might complete the men 's college basketball awards Grand Slam of National Player of the Year , Defensive Player of the Year , Freshman of the Year and the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming draft . \" During the exhibition portion of the season for the 2011 \u2013 12 Wildcats , Calipari described Davis as follows : \" He 's 6 \u2013 10 with a 7 \u2013 3 wingspan and he can shoot the 3 and dribble the ball and lead the break . . . \" Less than a month into the season , ESPN 's Andy Katz described him similarly : \" Davis offers a multitude of skills for the Wildcats with his ability to block shots , run the floor , score in the low post and face up to the basket . \" Since Calipari had coached Marcus Camby , who was also a tall shot-blocker , Davis drew comparisons to Camby . ESPN selected Davis as a preseason All-American along with teammate Terrence Jones . Some sources , such as Blue Ribbon , selected Connecticut 's Andre Drummond as the preseason Freshman / Newcomer of the Year ahead of Davis , although Davis was the only freshman on the ESPN 10-man preseason team . Davis only received one vote for the Associated Press preseason All-America team . After most of the pre-conference schedule but before the 2011 \u2013 12 Southeastern Conference men 's basketball schedule , Davis ' teammate , Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was mentioned as a possible Southeastern Conference Men 's Basketball Player of the Year . However , after less than a month of Southeastern Conference play , Davis was not only being mentioned as conference player of the year , but also National Player of the Year . By mid February , he was considered a National Player of the Year front-runner with his primary competition coming from Thomas Robinson of Kansas .

( June 18 , 1924 \u2013 June 1 , 2005 ) , nicknamed Mr. Basketball , was an American professional basketball player for the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League ( NBL ) and the Minneapolis Lakers of the NBL , the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) and the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . Invariably playing with thick , round spectacles , the 6 ft 10 in ( 2.08 m ) , 245 pounds ( 111 kg ) Mikan is seen as one of the pioneers of professional basketball , redefining it as a game of so-called big men with his prolific rebounding , shot blocking , and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot , the result of his namesake Mikan Drill . Mikan had a successful playing career , winning seven NBL , BAA , and NBA championships , an All-Star MVP trophy , and three scoring titles . He was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games , and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams . Mikan was so dominant that he caused several rule changes in the NBA , among them , the introduction of the goaltending rule , the widening of the foul lane \u2014 known as the \" Mikan Rule \" \u2014 and the creation of the shot clock . After his playing career , Mikan became one of the founders of the American Basketball Association ( ABA ) , serving as commissioner of the league . He was also vital for the forming of the Minnesota Timberwolves . In his later years , Mikan was involved in a long-standing legal battle against the NBA , fighting to increase the meager pensions for players who had retired before the league became lucrative . In 2005 , Mikan died after a long battle with diabetes . For his feats , Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959 , made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 , and was elected one of the NBA 's 50 Greatest Players ever in 1996 . Since April 2001 , a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Timberwolves ' Target Center . = = Early years = = George Mikan was born in Joliet , Illinois , as an American of Croatian descent . As a boy , he shattered one of his knees so badly that he was kept in bed for a year and a half . In 1938 , Mikan attended the Chicago Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary and originally wanted to be a priest , but then moved back home to finish at Joliet Catholic . Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete . When Mikan entered Chicago 's DePaul University in 1942 , he stood 6 ' 10 \" , weighed 245 pounds , moved awkwardly because of his frame , and wore thick glasses for his near-sightedness . = = DePaul University = = However , Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul basketball coach Ray Meyer , who saw potential in the bright and intelligent , but also clumsy and shy , freshman . Put into perspective , Meyer 's thoughts were revolutionary , because at the time it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well . In the following months , Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident , aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it . Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively , and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand . This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill . In addition , Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag , take dancing lessons , and jump rope to make him a complete athlete . From his first National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) college games for DePaul on , Mikan dominated his peers . He intimidated opponents with his size and strength , was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot , and soon established a reputation as one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league , often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls . In addition , Mikan also surprised the basketball world with his unique ability of goaltending , i.e. jumping so high that he swatted the ball away before it could pass the hoop . In today 's basketball , touching the ball after it reaches its apogee is a violation , but in Mikan 's time it was legal because people thought it was impossible anyone could reach that high . \" We would set up a zone defense that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket \" , Mikan later recalled his DePaul days . \" When the other team took a shot , I 'd just go up and tap it out . \" As a consequence , the NCAA and later the NBA , outlawed goaltending . One of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan was Bob Kurland , a seven-footer from Oklahoma A & M. Mikan was named the Helms NCAA College Player of the Year twice in 1944 and 1945 and an All-American three times , leading DePaul to the NIT title in 1945 , which was as prestigious as the NCAA tournament at the time . Mikan led the nation in scoring with 23.9 points per game in 1944 \u2013 45 and 23.1 in 1945 \u2013 46 . When DePaul won the 1945 National Invitation Tournament , Mikan was named Most Valuable Player for scoring 120 points in three games , including 53 points in a 97 \u2013 53 win over Rhode Island , equalling the score of the entire Rhode Island team . = = Professional playing career = = = = = Chicago American Gears ( 1946 \u2013 47 ) = = = After the end of the 1945 \u2013 46 college season , Mikan signed with the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League , a predecessor of the modern NBA . He played with them for 25 games at the end of the 1946 \u2013 47 NBL season , scoring 16.5 points per game as a rookie . Mikan led the Gears to the championship of the World Basketball Tournament , where he was elected Most Valuable Player after scoring 100 points in five games , and also voted into the All-NBL Team . However , before the start of the 1947 \u2013 48 NBL season , Maurice White , the president of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team , pulled the team out of the league . White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America , in which he owned all the teams and arenas . However , the league folded after just a month , and the players of White 's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises . As a consequence , every team had a 9.09 % chance of landing Mikan , who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers , playing for coach John Kundla . = = = Minneapolis Lakers ( 1947 \u2013 56 ) = = = In his first season with the Lakers , Mikan led the league in scoring with 1,195 points , becoming the first and only NBL player to score more than 1,000 points in an NBL season . He was named league MVP , and the Lakers won the NBL title . The following year , the Lakers and three other NBL franchises jumped to the fledgling Basketball Association of America . Mikan led his new league in scoring , and again set a single-season scoring record . The Lakers defeated the Washington Capitols in the 1949 BAA Finals . In 1949 , the BAA and NBL merged to form the NBA . The new league started the inaugural 1949 \u2013 50 NBA season , featuring 17 teams , with the Lakers in the Central Division . Mikan again was dominant , averaging 27.4 points per game and 2.9 assists per game and taking another scoring title ; Alex Groza of Indianapolis Olympians was the only other player to break the 20-point-barrier that year . After comfortably leading his team to an impressive 51 \u2013 17 record and storming through the playoffs , Mikan 's team played the 1950 NBA Finals against the Syracuse Nationals . In Game 1 , the Lakers beat Syracuse on their home court when Lakers reserve guard Bob Harrison hit a 40-foot buzzer beater to give Minneapolis a two-point win . The team split the next four games , and in Game 6 , the Lakers won 110 \u2013 95 and won the first-ever NBA championship . Mikan scored 31.3 points per game in the playoffs . In the 1950 \u2013 51 NBA season , Mikan was dominant again , scoring a career-best 28.4 points per game in the regular season , again taking the scoring crown , and had 3.1 assists per game . In that year , the NBA introduced a new statistic : rebounds . In this category , Mikan also stood out ; his 14.1 rebounds per game ( rpg ) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse . In that year , Mikan participated in one of the most notorious NBA games ever played . When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers , the Pistons took a 19 \u2013 18 lead . Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball , the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket . With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense , the score stayed 19 \u2013 18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time . This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock , which was introduced four years later . Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers ' 18 points , thus scoring 83.3 % of his team 's points , setting an NBA all-time record . In the post season , Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals . With Mikan hardly able to move all series long , the Royals won 3 \u2013 1 . Decades later , in 1990 , Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate ; however , despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot , he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game . In the 1951 \u2013 52 NBA season , the NBA decided to widen the foul lane under the basket from 6 feet to 12 feet . As players could stay in the lane for only three seconds at a time , it forced big men like Mikan to post-up from double the distance . A main proponent of this rule was New York Knicks coach Joe Lapchick , who regarded Mikan as his nemesis , and it was dubbed \" The Mikan Rule \" . While Mikan still scored an impressive 23.8 points per game , it was a serious reduction from his 27.4 points per game the previous season , and his field goal percentage sank from .428 to .385 . He still pulled down 13.5 rebounds per game , asserting himself as a top rebounder , and logged 3.0 assists per game . Mikan also had a truly dominating game that season , in which he scored a personal-best 61 points in a double overtime victory against the Rochester Royals . At the time , it was the second-best performance in league history behind Joe Fulks ' 63-point score in 1949 , and Mikan 's output more than doubled that of his teammates , whose output that game totaled 30 points . In the 1952 NBA All-Star Game , Mikan had a strong performance with 26 points and 15 rebounds in a West loss . Later that season , the Lakers reached the 1952 NBA Finals and were pitted against the New York Knicks . This qualified as one of the strangest Finals series in NBA history , as neither team could play on their home court in the first six games . The Lakers ' Minneapolis Auditorium was already booked , and the Knicks ' Madison Square Garden was occupied by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus . Instead , the Lakers played in St. Paul and the Knicks in the damp , dimly lit 69th Regiment Armory . Perpetually double-teamed by Knicks ' Nat Clifton and Harry Gallatin , Mikan was unable to assert himself and it was more Vern Mikkelsen 's credit that the first six games were split . In the only true home game , Game 7 in the Auditorium , the Lakers won 82 \u2013 65 and edged the Knicks 4 \u2013 3 , winning the NBA title and earning themselves $ 7,500 to split among the team . During the 1952 \u2013 53 NBA season , Mikan averaged 20.6 points and a career-high 14.4 rebounds per game , the highest in the league , as well as 2.9 assists per game . In the 1953 NBA All-Star Game , Mikan was dominant again with 22 points and 16 rebounds , winning that game 's MVP Award . The Lakers made the 1953 NBA Finals , and again defeated the Knicks 4 \u2013 1 . In the 1953 \u2013 54 NBA season , the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined , averaging 18.1 points , 14.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game . Under his leadership , the Lakers won another NBA title in the 1954 NBA Finals , making it their third-straight championship and fifth in six years ; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg . From an NBA perspective , the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957 \u2013 69 . At the end of the season , Mikan announced his retirement . He later said : \" I had a family growing , and I decided to be with them . I felt it was time to get started with the professional world outside of basketball . \" Injuries also were a factor , as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career , often having to play through these injuries . Without Mikan , the Lakers made the playoffs , but were unable to reach the 1955 NBA Finals . In the middle of the 1955 \u2013 56 NBA season , Mikan returned to the Lakers lineup . He played in 37 games , but his long absence had affected his play . He averaged only 10.5 points , 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists , and the Lakers lost in the first round of the playoffs . At the end of the season , Mikan retired for good . His 10,156 points were a record at the time ; he was the first NBA player to score 10,000 points in a career . He was inducted into the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame class of 1959 and was declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press . = = Post-playing career = = In 1956 , Mikan was the Republican candidate for the United States Congress in Minnesota 's 3rd congressional district . He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout . Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower , the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52 % to 48 % . Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan 's 117,716 . Returning to the legal profession , Mikan was frustrated , after hoping for an influx of work . For six months , Mikan did not get any assignments at all , leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him to cash in on his life insurance . Problems also arose in Mikan 's professional sports career . In the 1957 \u2013 58 NBA season , Lakers coach John Kundla became general manager and persuaded Mikan to become coach of the Lakers . However , this was a failure , as the Lakers endured a 9 \u2013 30 record until Mikan stepped down and returned coaching duties to Kundla . The Lakers ended with a 19 \u2013 53 record , to record one of the worst seasons in their history . After this failure , Mikan then concentrated on his law career , raising his family of six children , successfully specializing in corporate and real estate law , and buying and renovating buildings in Minneapolis . In 1967 , Mikan returned to professional basketball , becoming the first commissioner of the American Basketball Association , a rival league to the NBA . In order to lure basketball fans to his league , Mikan invented the league 's characteristic red-white-and-blue ABA ball , which he thought more patriotic , better suited for TV , and more crowd-pleasing than the brown NBA ball , and instituted the three-point line . Mikan resigned from the ABA in 1969 . In the mid-1980s , Mikan headed a task force with a goal of returning professional basketball to Minneapolis , decades after the Lakers had moved to Los Angeles to become the Los Angeles Lakers , and after the ABA 's Minnesota Muskies and Minnesota Pipers had departed . This bid was successful , leading to the inception of a new franchise in the 1989 \u2013 90 NBA season , the Minnesota Timberwolves . In 1994 , Mikan became the part-owner and chairman of the board of the Chicago Cheetahs , a professional roller hockey team based in Chicago , Illinois , that played in Roller Hockey International . The franchise folded after their second season . In his later years , Mikan suffered from diabetes and failing kidneys , and eventually , his illness caused his right leg to be amputated below the knee . When his medical insurance was cut off , Mikan soon found himself in severe financial difficulties . He fought a long and protracted legal battle against the NBA and the NBA Players ' Union , protesting the $ 1,700 / month pensions for players who had retired before 1965 , the start of the so-called \" big money era \" . According to Mel Davis of the National Basketball Retired Players Union , this battle kept him going , because Mikan hoped to be alive when a new collective bargaining agreement would finally vindicate his generation . In 2005 , however , his condition worsened . = = Legacy = = Mikan is lauded as the pioneer of Modern Age basketball . He was the original center , who scored 11,764 points , an average of 22.6 per game , retired as the all-time leading scorer and averaged 13.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 520 NBL , BAA and NBA games . As a testament to his fierce playing style , he also led the league three times in personal fouls . He won seven NBL , BAA , and NBA championships , an All-Star MVP trophy , and three scoring titles , and was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams . As well as being declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press , Mikan was on the Helms Athletic Foundation all-time All-American team , chosen in a 1952 poll , was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959 , made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 and was elected one of the NBA 50 Greatest Players in 1996 . Mikan 's impact on the game is also reflected in the Mikan Drill , today a staple exercise of \" big men \" in basketball . When superstar center Shaquille O 'Neal became a member of the Los Angeles Lakers , Mikan appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover in November 1996 with O 'Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , calling Abdul-Jabbar and Mikan the \" Lakers legends \" to whom O 'Neal was compared . Since April 2001 , a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Minnesota Timberwolves ' Target Center . In addition , a banner in the Staples Center commemorates Mikan and his fellow Minneapolis Lakers . He is also honored by a statue and an appearance on a mural in his hometown of Joliet , Illinois . = = = Rule changes = = = Mikan became so dominant that the NBA had to change its rules of play in order to reduce his influence , such as widening the lane from six to twelve feet ( \" The Mikan Rule \" ) . He also played a role in the introduction of the shot clock ; and in the NCAA , his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending . Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA 's future , which would be dominated by tall , powerful players . As an official , Mikan is also directly responsible for the ABA three-point line which was later adopted by the NBA ; the existence of the Minnesota Timberwolves ; and the multi-colored ABA ball , which still lives on as the \" money ball \" in the NBA All-Star Three-Point Contest . = = Personal life = = In 1947 , he married his girlfriend Patricia , who remained his wife for the next 58 years until he died . Mikan fathered six children , sons Larry , Terry , Patrick and Michael , and daughters Trisha and Maureen . All his life , Mikan was universally seen as the prototypical \" gentle giant \" , tough and relentless on the court , but friendly and amicable in private life . He was also the older brother of Ed Mikan , another basketball player for both DePaul and the BAA . = = = Death = = = Mikan died in Scottsdale , Arizona , on June 1 , 2005 , of complications from diabetes and other ailments . His son Terry reported that his father had undergone dialysis three times a week , four hours a day , for the last five years . He was interred at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis . Mikan 's death was widely mourned by the basketball world , and also brought media attention to the financial struggles of several early-era NBA players . Many felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations . Shaquille O 'Neal paid for Mikan 's funeral . He said : \" Without number 99 [ Mikan ] , there is no me . \" Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons , there was a moment of silence to honor Mikan . Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA in the early days and single-handedly made the league credible and popular . The 2005 NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs was dedicated to Mikan .",

His nicknames include \" Mr. Clutch \" , for his ability to make a big play in a clutch situation , such as his famous buzzer-beating 60-foot shot that tied Game 3 of the 1970 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks ; \" The Logo \" , in reference to his silhouette being incorporated into the NBA logo ; \" Mr. Outside \" , in reference to his perimeter play with the Los Angeles Lakers ; and \" Zeke from Cabin Creek \" , for the creek near his birthplace of Chelyan , West Virginia . Playing the small forward position early in his career , West was a standout at East Bank High School and at West Virginia University , leading the Mountaineers to the 1959 NCAA championship game , earning the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player honor despite the loss . He then embarked on a 14-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers , and was the co-captain of the 1960 U.S. Olympic gold medal team in Rome , a squad that would be inducted as a unit into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010 . West \u2019 s NBA career was highly successful . Playing the guard position as a professional , he was voted 12 times into the All-NBA First and Second Teams , was elected into the NBA All-Star Team 14 times , and was chosen as the All-Star MVP in 1972 , the same year that he won the only title of his career . West holds the NBA record for the highest points per game average in a playoff series with 46.3 . He was also a member of the first five NBA All-Defensive Teams ( one second , followed by four firsts ) , which were introduced when he was 32 years old . Having played in nine NBA Finals , he is also the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team ( 1969 ) . West was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980 and voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA history in 1996 . After his playing career , West was head coach of the Lakers for three years , leading Los Angeles into the playoffs each year and earning a Western Conference Finals berth once . Working as a player-scout for three years , West was named general manager of the Lakers prior to the 1982 \u2013 83 NBA season . Under his reign , Los Angeles won six championship rings . In 2002 , West became general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies and helped the franchise win their first-ever playoff berths . For his contributions , West won the NBA Executive of the Year Award twice , once as a Lakers manager ( 1995 ) and then as a Grizzlies manager ( 2004 ) . West 's son , Jonnie , played college basketball for the West Virginia Mountaineers team . = = Early life = = Jerry Alan West was born into a poor household in Chelyan , West Virginia . He was the fifth of six children of his mother Cecil Sue West , a housewife , and her husband Howard Stewart West , a coal mine electrician . West was a shy , introverted boy , who became even more withdrawn when his closest brother David died in the Korean War at age 22 when Jerry was 12 . He was so small and frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children 's sports , to prevent him from getting seriously hurt . Growing up , West spent his days hunting and fishing , but his main distraction was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed . West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle , ignoring mud and snow in the backyard , as well as his mother 's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner ; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as \" obsessive \" . = = = High school = = = West attended high school in East Bank , West Virginia from 1952 to 1956 . During his first year , he was mostly benched by his coach Duke Shaver due to his lack of height . Shaver emphasized the importance of conditioning and defense , lessons which the teenager appreciated . Soon , West became the captain of the freshman team and , during the summer of 1953 , he grew to 6 ft 0 in ( 1.83 m ) . Eventually becoming the team 's starting small forward , West quickly established himself as one of the finest West Virginian high school players of his generation . He was named All-State from 1953 \u2013 56 , then All-American in 1956 when he was West Virginia Player of the Year , becoming the state 's first high-school player to score more than 900 points in a season , with an average of 32.2 points per game . West 's mid-range jump shot became his trademark and he often used it to score while under pressure from opposing defense . West led East Bank to a state championship on March 24 that year , prompting East Bank High School to change its name to \" West Bank High School \" every year on March 24 in honor of their basketball prodigy , until its closure in 1999 . = = West Virginia Mountaineers = = After graduating from high school in 1956 , more than 60 universities showed interest in West , and he eventually chose to attend West Virginia University ( WVU ) , located in Morgantown . In his freshman year ( 1956 \u2013 57 ) , West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 wins without a loss over the course of the season ; other team members included Jay Jacobs and Willie Akers . In his first varsity year under head coach Fred Schaus , West scored 17.8 points per game and averaged 11.1 rebounds ; he also started in all 28 games while shooting 49.6 % from the field and 73.2 % from the free throw line . These performances earned him a multitude of honors , among them an All-American Third Team call-up ; First Team All-Southern Conference ; Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player Award and First Team honors ; Chuck Taylor-Converse Second-team All-American honors ; and Associated Press and United Press International Third-team All-American honors . The Mountaineers went 26 \u2013 2 that year , ending the season with a loss to Manhattan College in post-season tournament play . During his junior year ( 1958 \u2013 59 ) , West scored 26.6 points per game and grabbed 12.3 rebounds per game . He tied the NCAA five-game tournament record of 160 points ( 32.0 points per game ) and led all scorers and rebounders in every West Virginia game , including getting 28 points and 11 rebounds in a 71 \u2013 70 loss to California in the final . West was named Most Outstanding Player of that year 's Final Four . Further awards were All-American , Southern Conference Tournament MVP and Southern Conference Player of the Year and Athlete of the Year . He was also named to be a member of the U.S. Pan American Games basketball team which won the gold medal . West demonstrated his tenacity to the game in a match against the Kentucky Wildcats ; an incident in the game broke his nose , but he continued playing despite intense pain and having to breathe through his mouth . He scored 19 points in the second-half , leading WVU to an upset victory . In his final collegiate season ( 1959 \u2013 60 ) West averaged several career highs , such as scoring 29.3 points per game , a 134 season-assists , 16.5 rebounds per game , and a shooting average of 50.4 % from the field , 76.6 % from the free throw line . He was honored again with several awards : a call-up to the All-American selection , and being voted Southern Conference MVP . West 's best performance was a game against Virginia , in which he grabbed 16 rebounds and scored 40 points . Moreover , during that final year , he had 30 double-doubles and fifteen 30-point games . In his collegiate career , West totaled 2,309 points and 1,240 rebounds . He averaged 24.8 points per game and 13.3 rebounds . As of 2011 , West holds 12 WVU all-time records . Along with Oscar Robertson , West co-captained the U.S. men 's basketball team at the 1960 Summer Olympics and won the gold medal . = = Los Angeles Lakers = = = = = \" Mr. Inside \" and \" Mr. Outside \" = = = West then made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft , and was drafted with the 2nd overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers , shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles . West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise . His college coach was also hired to coach the Lakers . He played West as a guard , in contrast to West 's college days as a forward . The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor , who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix ; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins ; and guards Rod Hundley ( from West Virginia , like West ) , Frank Selvy , and Bob Leonard . This team perennially had strong forwards and guards , but was constantly weak at center , giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center , Bill Russell . Initially , West felt odd in his new environment . He was a loner . His high-pitched voice earned him the nickname \" Tweety Bird \" , and he spoke with such a thick Appalachian accent that his teammates also referred to him as \" Zeke from Cabin Creek \" ( his nickname acknowledged his country roots , and his accent was so thick that he squeaked his nickname sheepishly - \" Zeek fr 'm Cab 'n Creek \" ) . However , West soon impressed his colleagues with his defensive hustle , with his vertical jump \u2014 he could reach up 16 inches above the rim when he went up \u2014 and with his work ethic , spending countless extra hours working on his game . On the floor , West scored 17.6 points , grabbed 7.7 rebounds and gave 4.2 assists per game . West won Schaus 's trust and , alternating with Hundley , Selvy , and Leonard , played 35 minutes per game and established himself as the Lakers ' second scoring option . The NBA commented that the Lakers now had a potent one-two-punch \u2014 with \" Mr. Inside \" ( the low-post scorer , Baylor ) and \" Mr. Outside \" ( the long-distance shooter , West ) . These performances soon earned West his first of fourteen NBA All-Star Game call-ups . West helped the Lakers improve from their previous 25-win season to 36 wins as they reached the 1961 NBA Playoffs . They needed all five games to put away the Detroit Pistons ; but then lost to the St. Louis Hawks in seven games , losing the final game 105 \u2013 103 . In West 's second NBA season , the Lakers could only make limited use of Baylor , who was called up by the U.S. Army Reserves and could play only 48 games . However , West seamlessly took over the role of team leader and established himself as the main Lakers scorer , averaging 30.8 points , 7.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game , winning All-NBA First Team honors . West became known especially for hitting important late-game shots , and Lakers ' announcer Chick Hearn named him \" Mr. Clutch \" a handle which stuck with West for his entire career . The Lakers won 54 regular season games and secured a first-round bye in the 1962 NBA Playoffs . They beat the Pistons four games to two to advance to the 1962 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics . The teams split the first two games , and at the end of Game 3 in Los Angeles , West tied the game at 115 . The Celtics ' Sam Jones inbounded the ball at half-court with three seconds left . West stole the ball , raced upcourt , and converted a running layup as the buzzer sounded . The Celtics tied the series in Game 6 at three games apiece , and the teams headed to Boston for Game 7 . For most of the game , the Lakers trailed , but West and Frank Selvy hit several clutch baskets and tied the game at 100 . Selvy then missed an open 8-foot shot which would have won the Lakers their first title . Baylor 's tip-in attempt was thwarted by Sam Jones . In overtime , Jones scored several clutch baskets to ensure a 110 \u2013 107 win for the Celtics . The 1962 NBA finals would serve as the beginning of the greatest rivalry in NBA history In the 1962 \u2013 63 NBA season , Baylor was back full-time . West averaged 27.8 points , 7.0 rebounds and 5.6 assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team ; however , he played in only 55 regular season games , missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury . Again , the Lakers reached the finals , and again , they battled the Celtics . With West not yet in shape , Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3 \u2013 2 ; then they succumbed in Game 6 in front of their home crowd with a 112 \u2013 109 loss . As the game ended , veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena . In the following 1963 \u2013 64 NBA season , West for the first time became the Lakers ' scoring leader , his 28.7 points per game eclipsing the 25.4 by Baylor , who stated that he suffered from knee problems . The Lakers struggled during the entire season , winning only 42 games , and were beaten in the first round of the 1964 NBA Playoffs by the Hawks in five games . = = = Leader of the Lakers = = = In the following 1964 \u2013 65 NBA season , West averaged 31.0 points ( at the time , a career-high ) , only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain . After ending the regular season with 49 wins , L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs , but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury . West spectacularly took over Baylor 's leader role , as he scored 49 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win . In Game 2 , Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard , who scored 52 points , nearly half of L.A. ' s total , in the 118 \u2013 115 win . The Bullets took their two home games , despite West scoring 44 and 48 points respectively , but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A. , the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42 points in a close 117 \u2013 115 win . West averaged 46.3 points per game , a figure that is still an NBA record . However , in the 1965 NBA Finals , the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers , 4 \u2013 1 . In Game 1 , which Boston easily won , defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones kept West to only 26 points , and in Game 2 , West scored 45 points , but Boston still won 129 \u2013 123 . In Game 3 , West scored 49 points , and L.A. finally won a game , but in Games 4 and 5 , the Lakers were beaten by double digits ; in the last quarter of Game 5 , West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win . Still , the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6 points per game . In the 1965 \u2013 66 NBA season , West averaged a career-best 31.3 points , along with 7.1 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game . He made an NBA record 840 free throws , and earned yet another pair of All-Star Team and All-NBA First Team nominations . Winning 45 games , the Lakers beat the St. Louis Hawks in a close seven-game series , and yet again met the Boston Celtics in the 1966 NBA Finals . West was assisted by Baylor , who was a self-estimated \" 75 percent \" of his pre-injury self , The two long-standing rivals split the first six games , with West 's usual scoring dominance countered by Celtics forward John Havlicek , whose size and speed created serious mismatch problems for the Lakers . In Game 7 , West and Baylor shot a combined three of 18 in the first half , and the Lakers fell far behind ; L.A. willed themselves back to a close 95 \u2013 93 with four seconds left , but the Celtics ran the clock out and the Lakers were denied yet again . The following 1966 \u2013 67 NBA season saw West playing only 66 regular-season games due to injury ; his averages fell slightly to 28.0 points , 5.9 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game . The Lakers had a disappointing season , winning only 36 games and getting swept by the San Francisco Warriors in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs . Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired , and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over ; under his reign , the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967 \u2013 68 NBA season in their first year in The Forum . The 52 wins were accumulated despite West playing only 51 regular season games due to injury and scoring 26.3 points , the lowest average since his rookie year : after being a First-Teamer for six times en bloc , he only made the All-NBA Second Team . In the 1968 NBA Playoffs , the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls and the Warriors to set up yet another Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals ; it was considered a match of size versus speed , as the Lakers had nobody to counter Celtics coach / center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket , but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor , West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich . In Game 1 , West only hit seven of 24 shots , and the Lakers lost 107 \u2013 101 , but L.A. evened out the series at two games each . But West , who had scored 38 points in a Game 4 win , had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength the rest of the series . In Game 5 , an injured West scored 35 points , but Boston won by three points . In Game 6 , Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40 points , and after yet another Celtics loss , West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won : \" We gave them the first game , and we gave them the fifth . But I take nothing from them \u2026 They 're all that way on the Celtics , and you can 't teach it . \" = = = Arrival of Wilt Chamberlain = = = On July 9 , 1968 , the Lakers made a trade which brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1968 \u2013 69 NBA season . To get the center , the Lakers traded West 's backcourt partner Archie Clark , starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia . Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark , and especially after losing Goodrich due to the expansion draft of the Phoenix Suns . He only had diminutive , defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West . While West himself got on well with the new recruit , Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff . Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain \" The Load \" , and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical , never respected him , too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics . In return , the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as \" the dumbest and worst coach ever \" . There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened . West was clearly disturbed by locker room tension ; used to playing in teams with good chemistry , his quality of play became erratic , and he posted a career-low 25.9 points . However , he made the Second Team of the inaugural All-Defensive Team . In the 1969 NBA Playoffs , the 55-win Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks and the San Francisco Warriors , setting up the sixth finals series versus Boston in eight years . Prior to Game 1 , West privately complained to Bill Russell of exhaustion , but then the Lakers guard scored 53 points on Boston in a close two-point win . L.A. also took Game 2 , with West scoring 41 points . In Game 3 , Russell opted to double-team West , and the guard 's exhaustion began to show : West twice asked to be subbed for longer periods , and both times the Lakers fell back by double digits and finally lost by six points . Game 4 saw Celtics guard Sam Jones hit an off-balance buzzer beater to tie the series , but in Game 5 , the Lakers struck back and won by 13 points ; however , they suffered a major blow when West \u2013 who scored 39 points and by far led all players in scoring during the entire series \u2013 lunged for a meaningless late-game ball and seriously pulled his hamstring : it was immediately visible that the injury would not heal until the end of the series . A limping West scored 26 points in Game 6 , but the Celtics won 99 \u2013 90 with a strong Bill Russell , who held Chamberlain to only eight points in the entire game . In Game 7 , Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles . This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics and angered West . The Lakers trailed the entire game and were behind 91-76 after 3 quarters , but powered by a limping West , the Lakers closed the gap to 103-102 with two minutes to go and had the ball . But West committed costly turnovers and L.A. lost the game 108 \u2013 106 despite a triple-double 42 points , 13 rebounds and 12 assists from West , who became the only winner of the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award from the losing team . After the loss , West was seen as the ultimate tragic hero : after the game , Bill Russell held his hand , and John Havlicek said : \" I love you , Jerry \" . In the 1969 \u2013 70 NBA season under new coach Joe Mullaney , the Lakers ' season began with a shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed practically the whole regular season . As after Baylor 's injury years before , West stepped into the void , leading the NBA in scoring average with 31.2 points per game , and averaging 4.6 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game , earning him his first of four All-Defensive First Team vote and another All-NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years . The Lakers won 46 games , and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs , they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four , setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks , led by Hall-of-Famers , such as Willis Reed , Dave DeBusschere , Bill Bradley , and Walt Frazier . L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games , with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still-hobbling Chamberlain . In Game 3 , DeBusschere hit a mid-range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102 \u2013 100 , and the Lakers had no time-outs left . Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West , who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60-foot shot . Frazier later commented : \" The man 's crazy . He looks determined . He thinks it 's really going in ! \" West incredibly connected , and this basket was later called one of the greatest moments ever by the NBA . As the three-point line had not been introduced yet , the shot just tied the game . In overtime , West however sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots , and the Knicks won 111-108 . In Game 4 , the guard scored 37 points and 18 assists , and the Lakers won . However , more frustration awaited West in Game 5 , when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed out for the series ; instead of capitalising on a double-digit lead and reeling off an easy win , the Lakers committed 19 second half turnovers , and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times , respectively , in the entire second half and lost 107-100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history . After Chamberlain scored 45 points and West 31 points plus 13 assists in a series-equalising 135-113 Lakers win , the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7 . However , West had also injured his right hand and received several manual injections , and Reed famously hobbled up court prior to Game 7 : the Knicks center scored the first four points , and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time . With his injured hands , West still hit nine of his 19 shots , but was outplayed by Walt Frazier , who scored 36 points and 19 assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett . In the 1970 \u2013 71 NBA season , the Lakers resigned Gail Goodrich , who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968 . At age 32 , West averaged 27.9 points , 4.6 rebounds and 9.5 assists , and helped the Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs . After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career , West himself injured his knee and was out for the season ; the short-handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship-bound Milwaukee Bucks . The Milwaukee Bucks featured freshly crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor ( later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ) and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson . = = = Late success and twilight years = = = Prior to the 1971 \u2013 72 NBA season , West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement . The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall-of-Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach . Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career , the Lakers had a season for the ages : powered by Sharman 's emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense , L.A. embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak , en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season . West himself contributed with 25.8 points and leading the league with a career-high 9.7 assists per game , was named All-Star , All-NBA and All-Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All-Star Game MVP . In the post-season , the Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls in a four-game sweep , then went on to face the Milwaukee Bucks , and defeated them in six games . In the 1972 NBA Finals , the Lakers again met the New York Knicks . Although West suffered a terrible shooting slump during Games 1 and 2 , the Lakers tied the series at one win each , and in Game 3 , he scored 21 points and helped L.A. win Game 3 . In this game , he now had scored 4,002 playoff points , which set an all-time NBA record . After winning Game 4 due to a superb outing from Wilt Chamberlain , West scored 23 points in Game 5 , and he won the game and their first-ever NBA title . West conceded that he had played a terrible series , and credited the team for the success . Years later he said \" I played terrible basketball in the Finals , and we won \u2026 It was particularly frustrating because I was playing so poorly that the team overcame me . Maybe that 's what a team is all about . \" Now having vanquished this long-time bane , West entered his 13th NBA year . In the 1972 \u2013 73 NBA season , the main scoring role was taken by Goodrich , and West was now a playmaker instead of a scorer . However , West averaged 22.8 points , but also averaged 8.8 assists per game , and again was a First Teamer in the All-Star , All-NBA , and All-Defense Teams . The Lakers won 60 games and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks . In Game 1 West scored 24 points before fouling out with three minutes left and L.A. won Game 1 with 115 \u2013 112 . However , the Knicks took Games 2 and 3 , and West strained both of his hamstrings : in Game 4 , the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York , and in Game 5 , the valiant , but injured West and Hairston had miserable games , and despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds , the Lakers lost 102 \u2013 93 and the series . The following 1973 \u2013 74 NBA season was to be West 's last . Now 36 years old , the veteran guard averaged 20.3 points , 3.7 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game . In two newly introduced statistics , steals and blocks , he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game . Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin , West was still regarded as an elite guard , earning another callup into his final All-Star Game . Without Chamberlain , who had ended his NBA career , the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks . After this loss , West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke , and filed a suit for unpaid back wages . West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing , however he said Cooke \" basically told my agent to go to hell . I felt I was deceived . When you feel that you \u2019 re deceived you don \u2019 t want any part of the organization that deceived you . I could \u2019 ve played another very good year . Every athlete says that . But I could \u2019 ve , and I knew I could \u2019 ve . But I could never have played for the Lakers again , and I wasn \u2019 t going to play for anybody else . \" At the time of his departure , West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history . = = = Coaching and managing career = = = Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was known for having a keen eye identifying leadership and teaching qualities ( he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial / head coaching positions ) , and asked West to coach and participate in player personnel decisions . In the 1976 \u2013 77 season , West became coach of the Los Angeles Lakers . In three years , he led the Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a 145 \u2013 101 record , making the playoffs in all 3 seasons and reaching the Western Conference Finals once in 1977 . After his coaching stint , he worked as a scout for three years before becoming general manager of the Lakers prior to the 1982 \u2013 83 season . NBA.com credits West in creating the great 1980s Lakers dynasty , which brought five championship rings ( 1980 , 1982 , 1985 , 1987 and 1988 ) to Los Angeles . After a slump in the early 1990s , West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac , forward Cedric Ceballos , and guard Nick Van Exel , which won 48 games , and went to the Western Conference Semifinals ; for turning the team around , West received his first Executive of the Year Award . By trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant , signing free agent center Shaquille O 'Neal , and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach , West laid down the fundaments of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002 . In 2002 , West became general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies . He explained his decision with the desire for exploring something new : \" After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years , I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success . I want to help make a difference . \" West 's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint , but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team , practically making no trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available ( e.g. Pau Gasol , James Posey and Jason Williams ) and signing coach Hubie Brown , who became Coach of the Year in 2004 . West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year . At age 69 , West retired as a Grizzlies general manager in 2007 and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace , from Buckhannon , West Virginia . On May 19 , 2011 , West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member , reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber . This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team . = = Legacy = = West ended his playing career with 14 All-Star , 12 All-NBA Team and five All-Defensive Team selections , and scored 25,192 points , 6,238 assists and 5,366 rebounds in 932 games , translating to an average of 27.0 points , 6.7 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game . Among retired players , only Michael Jordan , Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain surpass his 27.0 points per game average . He led the Lakers in scoring in seven seasons , only Jordan had a higher career scoring average in the playoffs ( 33.5 versus 29.1 ) . In 1979 , West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame , and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983 . In March 2008 , ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time . As a coach , West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns , and then went on to win seven NBA championships as a general manager , building the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players Magic Johnson , Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy and the 2000s under coach Phil Jackson and players Shaquille O 'Neal and Kobe Bryant . In the summer of 2000 , the city of Morgantown , West Virginia , and West Virginia Governor Cecil Underwood , dedicated the road outside of the West Virginia University Coliseum , \" Jerry West Boulevard \" . The same road is shared on the south end of Morgantown with Don Knotts Boulevard , in honor of another WVU alumnus . Also , on November 26 , 2005 , his number 44 became the first basketball number to be retired by West Virginia University and on February 17 , 2007 , a bronze statue of him was honored outside of the WVU Coliseum . On February 17 , 2011 , a Jerry West statue was unveiled outside Staples Center at the Star Plaza in Los Angeles , California . Finally , the NBA logo itself is modelled after West 's silhouette . = = Player profile = = West was an all-around combo guard who could take the playmaking roles of a point guard and score like a shooting guard , while being equally strong on offense and on defense . He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as \" lightning quick \" , and was known for making baskets late in the game , earning him the nickname \" Mr. Clutch \" . Having played forward early in his career , West was also a capable rebounder , and gifted with long arms , quick hands and strong defensive instincts , West was also once described as one of the best ball hawks , man-to-man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards : when the All-Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969 , West made every one of them until his career ended in 1974 . \" He stole more than anybody , although they didn 't keep records on it then , \" said Sharman . However , contemporaries were most impressed by West 's work ethic , obsessively practicing and shooting and rarely being satisfied with himself . West 's all-round game and attitude is maybe best expressed in his statistically most spectacular game : he once was credited with 44 points ( 16 of 17 shots from the field , 12 of 12 free throw attempts ) with 12 rebounds , 12 assists and ( unofficially counted ) 10 blocked shots , thus scoring a non-official ultra-rare quadruple double . Instead of being proud , West merely commented : \" Defensively , from a team standpoint , I didn 't feel I played very well . Very rarely was I satisfied with how I played . \" = = Personal life = = West married his college sweetheart Martha Jane Kane in April 1960 in Morgantown ; they divorced in 1976 . They have three sons , David , Mark and Michael . Jerry married his current wife Karen in 1978 . They have two sons , Ryan and Jonnie . Jonnie played guard for West 's old team , the West Virginia Mountaineers . As a person , West was often described as an introverted and nervous character , but who also drew highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic . Regarding his shyness , WVU room mate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year , and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled a two-week period when his guard never said a word . Apart from being shy , West was always restless : Schaus described him as a \" bundle of nerves \" , Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as \" always on the move \" , and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits , West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled . His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her . After a big loss , the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him , but West would say \" get out \" at the home porch and drive away \u2014 an experience that \" killed \" her as a wife . Early in his career , West 's West Virginian roots made him target for some mild jeering . He spoke with a high pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited , so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West \" Tweety Bird \" . His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach interrupted him and asked him to speak English . Baylor once commented : \" Rumors are safe with you , Tweety Bird . You pass them on , but nobody can understand you . \" West was also regarded for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic . The NBA described West as \" obsessive perfectionism , unabashed confidence , and an uncompromising will to win \u2026 a level of intensity so high it could melt lead \" . Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said : \" He took a loss harder than any player I 've ever known . He would sit by himself and stare into space . A loss just ripped his guts out . \" Even before his sole championship in 1972 , the Lakers held a \" Jerry West Night \" , and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said : \" Jerry , you are , in every sense of the word , truly a champion \u2026 If I could have one wish granted , it would be that you would always be happy . \" In 2011 , West wrote , along with bestselling author Jonathan Coleman , a memoir entitled West by West : My Charmed , Tormented Life , and revealed during an interview on HBO 's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel , that he was the victim of physical abuse from his father as a child , and has suffered from depression ever since . The book has had tremendous critical acclaim and became an instant New York Times bestseller .",

Coming from a family of professional basketball players , he is a member of the Argentine men 's national basketball team and the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . Hailed as one of the finest international players to grace the NBA , he plays a high-tempo and intense game . He is one of only two players , along with Bill Bradley , to have won a Euroleague title , an NBA championship , and an Olympic gold medal . Gin\u00f3bili spent the early part of his basketball career in Argentina and Italy , where he won several individual and team honors . His stint with Italian side Kinder Bologna was particularly productive ; he won two Italian League MVP awards , the Euroleague Finals MVP and the 2001 Euroleague and Triple Crown championships . Selected as the 57th overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft , the shooting guard is considered one of the biggest draft steals of all time . Gin\u00f3bili joined the Spurs in 2002 , and soon became a key player for the team . He has earned four NBA championships and was named an All-Star in 2005 and 2011 . In the 2007 \u2013 08 season , he was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year . Gin\u00f3bili has also enjoyed success with the Argentina national team . He made his debut in 1998 , and helped win the gold medal during the 2004 Olympics Basketball Tournament . = = Family and personal life = = Gin\u00f3bili comes from a family of basketball players . His oldest brother , Leandro , retired in 2003 after seven years in the Argentine basketball league , while brother Sebasti\u00e1n has played in both the local league and the Spanish Liga Espa\u00f1ola de Baloncesto . Their father Jorge was a coach at a club in Bah\u00eda Blanca , where Gin\u00f3bili learned to play the game . Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bah\u00eda Blanca and his idolization of Michael Jordan , Gin\u00f3bili 's love for basketball grew rapidly . Gin\u00f3bili has dual citizenship with Argentina and Italy , thanks to his Marchesan descent . As a result of his travels , he can speak Spanish , Italian and English fluently . In his free time , Gin\u00f3bili enjoys listening to Latin music , watching movies and relaxing with his friends . In 2004 , he married fellow Argentine Marianela Oro\u00f1o . On 16 May 2010 , his wife gave birth to twin boys , Dante and Nicola . On April 21 , 2014 , his wife gave birth to their third son , Luca . = = Professional career = = = = = Argentine and Italian years ( 1995 \u2013 2002 ) = = = Gin\u00f3bili made his professional debut in the Argentine basketball league for the Andino Sport Club team of La Rioja from 1995 \u2013 1996 , and was traded to Estudiantes de Bah\u00eda Blanca the next year . He played with his hometown team until 1998 . The Argentine moved to Europe to spend the 1998 \u2013 1999 and 1999 \u2013 2000 seasons with Italian team Basket Viola Reggio Calabria . In 1999 , he teamed with Brent Scott , Brian Oliver and Sydney Johnson to earn promotion from the Italian 2nd Division to the Italian 1st Division . Gin\u00f3bili then entered the 1999 NBA draft and the San Antonio Spurs selected him late in the second round with the 57th overall pick . However , he did not sign with the Spurs at this point . Instead , he returned to Italy to play for Kinder Bologna , which he helped win the 2001 Italian Championship , the 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups , and the 2001 Euroleague , where he was named the Euroleague 2000 \u2013 01 Euroleague Finals MVP . He was also named the Italian League MVP in 2000 \u2013 01 and 2001 \u2013 02 , and made the Italian League 's All-Star Game three times during this period . = = = San Antonio Spurs ( 2002 \u2013 present ) = = = It was not until after that Gin\u00f3bili joined the Spurs . There , At the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis , Gin\u00f3bili made the All-Tournament team alongside future NBA star Yao Ming and established NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojakovi\u0107 , and helped lead Argentina to a second-place finish . The Argentine joined the Spurs for the 2002 \u2013 03 NBA season , where he played backup for veteran guard Steve Smith . He spent much of the early season injured , and found it hard to adjust to the NBA 's style of play . As his injury improved , so did Gin\u00f3bili , winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March , and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team at the end of the season . Still , he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60 \u2013 22 regular season win \u2013 loss record . The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers , at which point , Gin\u00f3bili rose to prominence . In contrast to his regular season , Gin\u00f3bili became an integral part of Gregg Popovich 's rotational set up in the playoffs , playing in every game . The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise , giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly favored Spurs . He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals , securing San Antonio 's second championship . After the win , Gin\u00f3bili won his first Olimpia de Oro ( \" Golden Olympia \" ) as Argentina 's sportsperson of the year , and met Argentine president N\u00e9stor Kirchner . A gym in Bah\u00eda Blanca was dedicated in Gin\u00f3bili 's honor as well . In the 2003 \u2013 04 season , the Spurs began featuring Gin\u00f3bili more regularly , starting him in half of the 77 regular season games in which he played . His statistics improved in all major categories , as he averaged 12.8 points , 4.5 rebounds , 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game . During the 2004 playoffs , the Spurs met their perennial rivals , the Los Angeles Lakers , in the Western Conference Semifinals . Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot , the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4 \u2013 2 . While Gin\u00f3bili did not start in a single playoff game as he did in 2003 , his playoff statistics improved significantly , with 13.0 points , 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game . After some initial issues with San Antonio over his contract , Gin\u00f3bili re-signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004 \u2013 05 season . This was his best season yet as he was selected as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team , marking his debut in the elite mid-season showcase . During the playoffs , Gin\u00f3bili 's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio 's third championship . The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4 \u2013 1 in the Conference Finals , before prevailing in a very defensive oriented seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons . Gin\u00f3bili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers , most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg , and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs . In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting , the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain Tim Duncan . The former finished the 2004 \u2013 05 season as the second leading scorer on the team . During the season , he became only the fourth person to win consecutive Olimpias de Oro , this time sharing the award with soccer star Carlos Tevez . The 2005 \u2013 06 season was an injury-plagued one for Gin\u00f3bili , who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play . He managed 65 games in the regular season , but saw a dip in major statistics as compared to the previous season . During the playoffs , he returned to form , but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals . In the 2006 \u2013 07 season , the Spurs lacked energy from their reserves and Gin\u00f3bili provided it by coming off the bench for most of the second half of the season helping the Spurs attain the best record in the second half of the season . Gin\u00f3bili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004 \u2013 05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games , his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio . The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets , Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz , before sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers to win his third and San Antonio 's fourth championship . Gin\u00f3bili was to play an even bigger role for the Spurs the following season , reaching career high averages in points , rebounds , assists , and three-point field goal percentage . On 21 April 2008 , the NBA announced that Gin\u00f3bili had won the 2008 Sixth Man Award ; only a couple of weeks later , the Argentine was also named to the All-NBA Third Team . In the playoffs , the Spurs defeated the Suns 4 \u2013 1 in the first round , Gin\u00f3bili was moved to the starting lineup in the second round against the New Orleans Hornets after the Spurs lost the first two road games . San Antonio eventually prevailed in seven games , the Argentine played another strong series , leading the Spurs in points and assists per game ( 21.3 and 6.0 respectively ) . However , San Antonio lost to arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals in five games , and once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships . The following season , Gin\u00f3bili was injured for most of the campaign , managing only 44 regular season games and missing the 2009 NBA Playoffs entirely . San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54 \u2013 28 record , but with an aging supporting cast ( Bowen , Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s ) , the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship . As it turned out , the strong play of Duncan and Tony Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4 \u2013 1 defeat by Dallas , and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000 . On 31 October 2009 , in a game against the Sacramento Kings , a bat descended onto the court at the AT & T Center , causing a stoppage of play . As the bat flew past , Gin\u00f3bili swatted the bat to the ground with his hand . He then carried the creature off the court , earning the applause of the crowd . On 9 April 2010 , the Spurs and Gin\u00f3bili agreed to a three-year , $ 39 million contract extension through the 2012 \u2013 13 season . In 2010 \u2013 11 , Gin\u00f3bili was named a Western Conference All-Star and was named to the All-NBA third team . In the lockout-shortened 2011 \u2013 12 , Gin\u00f3bili helped the Spurs go 50 \u2013 16 , as they advanced through to the Western Conference Finals , where they were defeated 4 \u2013 2 by the Oklahoma City Thunder . In Game 5 of the series , Gin\u00f3bili had a 34-point effort . In 2012 \u2013 13 , the Spurs advanced to the NBA Finals , where they faced the Miami Heat . In Game 5 of the series , Gin\u00f3bili scored a season-high 24 points , as the Spurs went up 3 \u2013 2 . However , they went on to lose Games 6 and 7 to lose the series in seven games .

His best accomplishment as a member of the national team came at the 2004 Athens Olympics Basketball Tournament when Argentina became the first team other than Team USA to win the gold medal in 16 years . The highlight of the tournament was his game-winning buzzer beater with 0.7 seconds remaining , on the opening day of the Olympics , in a game versus Serbia and Montenegro . Gin\u00f3bili led the team in both scoring ( 19.3 points per game ) and assists ( 3.3 assists per game ) .

He has established himself as a reliable and versatile back court presence , and was a relatively late bloomer , entering the NBA at age 25 in a period when entering the NBA as a teenager was very common . Apart from his up-tempo and aggressive style of play , Gin\u00f3bili is known for his clutch play . This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards , and his performances in San Antonio 's championship-winning campaigns . Gin\u00f3bili 's modus operandi however , causes concerns for some of his opponents . His go-to move is either a 3-pointer or a fierce attack to the basket , while he often lowers his head when driving to the basket to collapse defenses and create shots or passes to his teammates . Although Ginobili was not the originator or the first to bring the move to the NBA , he is credited for popularizing the Euro step in the league . He is also willing to draw charges on defense . In 2007 , he was even listed by ESPN writer Thomas Neumann at No. 6 on the list of greatest floppers in NBA history . Five years later , Ian Thomsen , a Sports Illustrated columnist , grouped Gin\u00f3bili with fellow European league players Anderson Varej\u00e3o and Vlade Divac as the players who \" made [ flopping ] famous \" , by exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to diving in soccer games . Having traversed the major basketball continents in his basketball career , Gin\u00f3bili is one of the few players who has enjoyed success under both the physical , one-on-one play of the NBA and the more technical , jump-shooting rule set of the FIBA . He is one of only two players in basketball history along with Bill Bradley to win the Euroleague , an Olympic gold medal , and an NBA Championship ring . He is also the first non-U.S. player to win both the NBA championship ring and the Olympic gold medal , and the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game ( after Panama 's Rolando Blackman ) . In 2007 , ESPN sportswriter John Hollinger ranked Gin\u00f3bili as the sixth best international player then-active in the NBA , describing the 57th draft pick as \" one of the great draft heists of all time \" , and attributed the trend of NBA teams drafting developing European players to the success of the Argentine . The following year , Gin\u00f3bili was named by ESPN as one of the best Euroleague players to have graced the NBA . = = Honors = =",

He contributed to a national championship with 10 points , including 2 key baskets in the final minutes , in the championship game of the 2015 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , despite spending much of the game in foul trouble while defending Frank Kaminsky of Wisconsin . Okafor finished as runner-up to Kaminsky in the John R. Wooden Award voting ( 3385 \u2013 3060 ) . On April 9 , Okafor declared for the 2015 NBA draft . = = Professional career = = = = = Philadelphia 76ers ( 2015 \u2013 present ) = = = On June 25 , 2015 , Okafor was selected with the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers . After debuting with a 20-point NBA Summer League performance on July 6 , Okafor signed a two-year contract with the 76ers on July 7 , with team options for two additional seasons . He debuted for the 76ers with a 26-point , 7-rebound , 2-block effort ( that also included 8 turnovers ) against the Boston Celtics on October 28 . The young 2015 \u2013 16 76ers team played no players over the age of 24 or with more than three years of NBA experience on opening night . In early November , he was stopped on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge between Philadelphia and Camden , New Jersey for speeding at 108 miles per hour ( 174 km / h ) , almost two-and-a-half times the bridge 's posted speed limit of 45 miles per hour ( 72 km / h ) . On November 9 , he posted his first career double-double with 21 points and 15 rebounds against his hometown Chicago Bulls . In the subsequent game on November 11 , Okafor posted 4 blocked shots along with 21 points and 7 rebounds against the Toronto Raptors . After the 76ers got off to an 0 \u2013 16 start to the season , Okafor was involved in a street fight with taunting individuals on November 25 in Boston . On November 30 , with additional reports surfacing that Okafor had been involved in various controversial and dangerous off-the-court situations , the 76ers agreed to a request to assign a security guard to accompany Okafor in public . On December 1 , Okafor and the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 103 \u2013 91 . The win ended the longest losing streak in the history of major professional sports in the United States ( 28 games going back to the prior season ) and the worst start in NBA history ( tied with the 2009 \u2013 10 New Jersey Nets at 0 \u2013 18 ) . The next day , video surfaced on TMZ of a second fight in Boston from November . Okafor was subsequently suspended by the 76ers for two games .

On February 6 , he recorded 22 points and a season-high 17 rebounds in a 103 \u2013 98 win over the Brooklyn Nets . The position swap was considered an improvement over the two players splitting time or having Noel play out of his natural position . On February 21 against the Dallas Mavericks , Okafor posted a career-high 31 points in a 129 \u2013 103 loss , surpassing not only his NBA career high , but also his 30-point game at Duke . On February 28 , Okafor posted 26 points against the Orlando Magic , but he endured a shin contusion in a collision with teammate Isaiah Canaan that was only expected to sideline him for a game . As he missed his fifth consecutive game , 76ers head coach Brett Brown noted that Okafor had a CT scan on his knee . On March 11 , Okafor was ruled out for the rest of the season after tests revealed that he had sustained a small tear of the meniscus in his right knee . Okafor finished fifth in the 2016 NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting and earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors . = = NBA career statistics = = = = = Regular season = = = = = International career = = In October 2010 , he successfully tried out for USA Basketball 's 2011 \u2013 12 USA Developmental National Team .

                    "text": "Dwyane Wade = Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr . ( born January 17 , 1982 ) is an American professional basketball player for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He has established himself as one of the most well-known and popular players in the league . Wade had the top selling jersey in the NBA for nearly two years , leading the league in jersey sales from the 2005 NBA Playoffs , until the midpoint of the 2006 \u2013 07 season . His first name is pronounced the same as the more common spellings \" Dwayne \" and \" Duane \" . After entering the league as the fifth pick in the 2003 NBA draft , Wade was named to the All-Rookie team and the All-Star team the following eleven seasons . In his third season , Wade led the Miami Heat to their first NBA championship in franchise history . He was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP as the Heat won the series 4 \u2013 2 over the Dallas Mavericks . At the 2008 Summer Olympics , Wade led the United States men 's basketball team , commonly known as the \" Redeem Team \" , in scoring , and helped them capture gold medal honors in Beijing , China . In the 2008 \u2013 09 season , Wade led the league in scoring and earned his first NBA scoring title . After LeBron James and Chris Bosh joined the Heat , Wade was part of Miami 's second championship win in the 2012 NBA Finals , when Miami defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder . He won his third NBA championship in 2013 , when the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals . In 2014 , the Heat reached the Finals for the fourth consecutive year , but lost in five games to the San Antonio Spurs . = = Early life = = Dwyane Wade was born on the South Side of Chicago , Illinois , to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr , whose name 's unusual spelling was decided by his own mother . In 1977 , JoLinda , at the age of 18 , already had two children . Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult . Wade stated that \" [ his ] mom was on drugs and [ his ] family was in the gang environment , so it was a rough childhood . \" At a very young age , Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can . When he was only 4 months old , his parents separated - and would later divorce . Jolinda was given custody of the two children , and she moved to her mother 's house with them . The family struggled financially , and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs . His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes , alcohol , heroin , and cocaine . JoLinda would get high with friends at her home , even in the presence of her children . In an interview with ESPN , Wade said \" I 've seen the needles laying around the house . I 've seen my mother shoot up before . I 've seen a lot of things my mother didn 't even know I 'd seen as a kid . \" At the age of 6 , he recalls police - with guns drawn - raiding his home as they searched for his mother . When Wade turned 8 years old , his older sister , Tragil , tricked him - by telling him they were going to the movies - into living with his father , a former Army sergeant , and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood . Wade would still occasionally visit his mom . A year later , his father moved the family to Robbins , Illinois . After moving to Robbins , Wade didn 't see his mother for two years . During this time , JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester - i.e. , someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them . JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD . In 1994 , JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail . Wade , at the age of 10 , reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone . JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes , but while serving her second sentence in 1997 , she failed to report to prison while on work release . Wade turned to sports , especially basketball and football , to avoid the temptations of participating in drug and gang-related activities . Wade 's mom and dad would often take him to the park to play basketball . He cites one of his older sisters , Tragil , as the individual most responsible for his childhood upbringing and for steering him in the proper direction . As a child growing up in the Chicago area , Wade idolized Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan , and has said he patterns his game after him . Wade attended Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn . Wade quickly found success as a wide receiver on the football team , but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year . While he did not acquire much playing time during his second year , his stepbrother , Demetris McDaniel , was the star of the team . Wade grew four inches in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in playing time , averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game . The following year , Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24 \u2013 5 record . It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional . During this season he set school records for points ( 676 ) and steals ( 106 ) in a season . Wade has stated that his high school coach , Jack Fitzgerald , was one of the most positive influences in his life during this time . Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams ( Marquette University , Illinois State , and DePaul University ) due to academic problems . During most of Wade 's time at Marquette , his mother was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine . On October 14 , 2001 , JoLinda declared that she would change her life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church . Wade , then a sophomore at Marquette , went home for Christmas to be with his mom , whom he believed was clean and sober for the first time in his life . However , JoLinda admitted to him that she was actually going back to prison . Wade told ESPN , \" I was hurt because I felt like I was just getting my mom back , and now she had to leave again . \" On January 2 , 2002 , his mother went back to prison to serve her 14-month sentence . She says she has been clean since 2003 . = = College career = = Wade chose to play college basketball for Tom Crean at Marquette University in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . During Wade 's freshman year at Marquette , he was ineligible to play with the men 's team as he had fallen short of academic standards set by the NCAA 's Proposition 48 . Wade sought tutoring to improve his writing skills in order to regain eligibility . = = = 2001 \u2013 02 season = = = Wade earned eligibility to play for the 2001 \u2013 2002 season , and he led the Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 ppg , led the conference in steals at 2.47 per game , and averaged of 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game . Marquette finished with a 26 \u2013 7 record , the school 's best record since the 1993 \u2013 94 season . = = = 2002 \u2013 03 season = = = In 2002 \u2013 03 , Wade led Marquette in scoring again with 21.5 ppg , and Marquette won the school 's first and only Conference USA championship with a 27 \u2013 6 record . That season Wade led the Golden Eagles to the Final Four , the school 's first appearance in the Final Four since winning the 1977 national championship . After the season , he was named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press ; Wade is the first Marquette basketball player since 1978 to do so . Wade 's performance during the Midwest Regional Final of the 2003 NCAA Tournament was highly publicized by the national press . Against heavily favored , top-ranked and top-seeded Kentucky Wildcats , Wade recorded a triple-double with 29 points , 11 rebounds , and 11 assists . His triple double was the fourth in NCAA Tournament history . Wade 's exceptional play helped lead Marquette over the Wildcats 83 \u2013 69 and into the Final Four ; Wade was named MVP of the Midwest Regional . Marquette finished the season ranked No.6 in the AP poll , the school 's highest ranking since the 1976 \u2013 77 season . Wade 's strong tournament play resulted in increased visibility in the national media and , consequently , a high draft projection . As a result , he elected to forgo his senior year at Marquette and enter the 2003 NBA draft . On February 3 , 2007 , almost four years after Wade played in his final collegiate game , Marquette retired his jersey at halftime of a game against Providence . Although Marquette requires student-athletes to graduate prior to receiving jersey retirement honors , the University made a special exception for Wade based on his accomplishments since leaving Marquette . On March 5 , 2003 , JoLinda Wade was released from prison . Three days later she saw Dwyane play basketball for the first time in five years . She watched Marquette beat Cincinnati , 70-61 , at the Bradley Center to win the Conference USA regular-season championship . Dwyane had 26 points , 10 rebounds , and five assists . = = NBA career = = = = = Miami Heat ( 2003 \u2013 2016 ) = = = = = = = Rookie year ( 2003 \u2013 04 ) = = = = Selected 5th overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat , Wade quickly emerged as a productive player on a youthful Miami Heat team and averaged 16.2 points on 46.5 % shooting with averages of 4.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game . Wade is one of only four Marquette University players to be drafted in the first round ; his is the highest draft selection in school history . After a 5 \u2013 15 start , the Heat would gradually improve and finish 42 \u2013 40 to qualify for the NBA playoffs . He further distinguished himself with outstanding performances in the playoffs , particularly against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals . In the end , however , Wade 's successful rookie season was somewhat overshadowed by the success of fellow rookies Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James . Wade did earn unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team , and also finished third in rookie of the year voting ( behind James and Anthony ) . He was ranked in the top five among rookies in several major statistical categories , including second in field goal percentage , second in steals , third in scoring , fourth in assists , and fourth in minutes played . In the playoffs Wade hit a game winning shot in Game 1 of the Heat 's first round series against the New Orleans Hornets . The Heat won the series 4 \u2013 3 and advanced to the second round to face the top-seeded and best record team in the NBA , the Indiana Pacers , in a very entertaining series that almost pushed the 61-win Pacers to the edge , though Miami would eventually lose the series in six games . He became the fourth rookie since the shot clock era began to lead his team in scoring and assist average in the postseason . = = = = Breakthrough year ( 2004 \u2013 05 ) = = = = Before the 2004 \u2013 05 season , Shaquille O 'Neal was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Heat . The following season , Miami improved by 17 games , from a 42 \u2013 40 record in the 2003 \u2013 04 season to an Eastern Conference-best 59 \u2013 23 record in the 2004 \u2013 05 season . The league 's coaches selected Wade to be a reserve in the 2005 All-Star Game . He scored 14 points in 24 minutes of play . In the first round of the 2005 NBA Playoffs , Wade averaged 26.3 points , 8.8 assists , and 6.0 rebounds while maintaining a 50 % field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets . Wade continued his high level of play in the second round by averaging 31 points , 7 rebounds , and 8 assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards . The Heat 's playoff run was stopped by the Detroit Pistons , the previous season 's champions , in 7 games in the Eastern Conference Finals . Wade scored 42 and 36 points in Games 2 and 3 respectively despite playing with sinusitis , the flu , and a knee strain . He also suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 of the Conference Finals that prevented him from playing in the series ' sixth game and limited him in the seventh . The Heat lost the series in the seventh game despite leading three games to two after the fifth game and holding a lead with three minutes remaining in Game 7 . = = = = NBA champion and Finals MVP ( 2005 \u2013 06 ) = = = = By the 2005 \u2013 06 season Wade had developed into one of the most prominent players in the NBA and was elected to his second All-Star Game , this time a starter . In the 2006 All-Star Game , Wade made the game winning put-back off of the Philadelphia 76ers ' Allen Iverson 's missed shot , to lead the East to a 122 \u2013 120 victory over the West . He scored 20 points on 9 / 11 field goals in 30 minutes of play . He finished the 2005 \u2013 06 regular season averaging 27.2 points , 6.7 assists , 5.7 rebounds , and 1.95 steals per game . Against the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs , Wade shook off a few injuries that scared Heat fans , including a severely bruised hip in Game 5 . Returning late in the half , Wade resurrected his team by scoring 15 of his 28 points while suffering from intense pain , leading the Heat to the much-needed 3 \u2013 2 series lead . After this , Wade successfully led his team to the 2006 NBA Finals , despite suffering from flu-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons . He put up a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists in that game , including an 8-point flurry to close out the third quarter that put the game out of reach . In his first trip to the NBA Finals , in which Miami faced off against the Dallas Mavericks , Wade had some especially memorable moments . His performance in games three , four , and five , in which he scored 42 , 36 , and 43 points , respectively , helped bring the Heat back from a 0 \u2013 2 deficit to lead the series 3-2 . In Game 3 Wade tied his career playoff high with 42 points and grabbed a career high 13 rebounds . Fifteen of his 42 points came in the fourth quarter , in which the Heat erased a 13-point deficit over the final 6 : 29 with a 22 \u2013 7 run which included a go-ahead jumper by NBA veteran Gary Payton that sealed the win . The Heat went on to win Game 6 behind Wade 's 36 points , taking the series 4 \u2013 2 , and Wade was presented with the Finals MVP trophy . He became the fifth youngest player in NBA history to capture NBA Finals MVP honors and recorded the third highest scoring average by a player in his first NBA Finals with 34.7 points per game . His 33.8 PER in the NBA finals was ranked by ESPN 's John Hollinger as the greatest Finals performance since the NBA-ABA merger . = = = = Injuries and missing playoffs ( 2006 \u2013 08 ) = = = = In the 2006 \u2013 07 season , Wade missed a total of 31 games due to injury . He was elected to his third straight All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors . He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing at least 31 games in a season since Pete Maravich of the Utah Jazz earned Second Team honors during the 1977 \u2013 78 season . Despite Wade 's play , the Heat struggled early in the season with injuries and were 20 \u2013 25 on February 1 , 2007 . But with Shaquille O 'Neal healthy and Pat Riley returning to the bench after undergoing hip and knee surgeries respectively , the Heat seemed poised to surge into the second half of the season . However , during a game against the Houston Rockets on February 21 , 2007 , while attempting to steal the ball from Shane Battier , Wade dislocated his left shoulder and was assisted off the court in a wheelchair . After the injury he was left with the decision to either rehabilitate the shoulder or undergo season-ending surgery . Wade later announced that he would put off the surgery and rehabilitate his shoulder with the intention of rejoining the team in time for the playoffs . After missing 23 games to recover from the injury , Wade returned to the active roster in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats . Sporting a black sleeve to help protect his dislocated left shoulder , Wade played 27 minutes and recorded 12 points and 8 assists , in a 111 \u2013 103 overtime loss .

After missing the Tournament of Americas Olympic Qualifiers over the summer , Miami 's eight pre-season games and first seven regular season games to recover from off-season left knee and left shoulder surgeries , Wade made his first appearance of the 2007 \u2013 08 season on November 14 , 2007 . Battling pain in his left knee throughout the season , Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance . However , with the Heat holding the worst record in the NBA and Wade still experiencing problems in his left knee , Heat coach Pat Riley announced Wade would miss the final 21 games of the season to undergo OssaTron treatment on his left knee . Wade averaged 24.6 points , 6.9 assists , 4.2 rebounds , and 1.7 steals per game for the season . = = = = Scoring champion and playoff defeats ( 2008 \u2013 10 ) = = = = After undergoing months of rehabilitation on his left knee and helping the U.S. Olympic team win a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics , in which he led the team in scoring , Wade returned to the starting lineup at the start of the 2008 \u2013 09 season .

Wade said he felt unwanted and under appreciated by Heat president Pat Riley , and noted that his relationship with Riley was in tatters by the end of negotiations . On July 15 , he officially signed with the Bulls . = = United States national team = = Wade was a member of the 2004 US Olympics team with fellow NBA All-Stars LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony . The team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan , in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game . The team won a bronze medal , which disappointed many USA fans who had hoped for a return to the days of the original \" Dream Team \" . Wade was named to the USA Men 's Basketball National Team from 2006 to 2008 . He was named co-captain of the 2006 team , along with James and Anthony . In 2007 , due to injury , Wade was unable to compete at the Tournament of Americas Olympic Qualifiers , where the United States compiled a 10 \u2013 0 record and qualified for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing , China . At the 2008 Olympics , the United States went unbeaten and earned gold medal honors , defeating the 2006 World Champion Spain in the final game . Wade led the team in scoring throughout the tournament and tallied a game high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75 % field goal shooting and added 4 steals , 2 assists and 2 rebounds in the game . For the tournament , he averaged a team high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67 % field goal shooting , 4 rebounds , 2 assists and 2.3 steals , as the United States lived up to their Redeem Team moniker and captured gold medal honors for the first time since 2000 . On June 28 , 2012 , it was reported that Wade would miss the 2012 Olympics in London because of knee surgery . = = Player profile = = Standing at 6 feet 4 inches tall ( 1.93 m ) and weighing 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) , Wade is a shooting guard that is also capable of playing point guard as he did during his rookie season and in subsequent seasons with smaller lineups . On offense , he has established himself as one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard , as well as one of the best slashers in the NBA . Wade 's signature one-two step allows him to dash past bigger defenders and occasionally get the extra foul shot . Wade is able to get to the free throw line consistently ; he ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004 \u2013 05 and again in the 2006 \u2013 07 season . He has proven himself an unselfish player , averaging 6.1 assists per game throughout his career . After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006 , Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA . He has gained a reputation for being capable of hitting game winning baskets and potential game winning free throws . David Thorpe , an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players in the offseason , also cites Wade 's developing post up game as one of his strengths . \" Watching Wade operate on the left block is literally like watching old footage of MJ ( Michael Jordan ) \" , comments Thorpe . Thorpe goes on to say that Wade 's best moves from the post are his turnaround jump shot , double pivot , and what Thorpe terms as a \" freeze fake \" , a pump fake Wade uses to get his opponent to jump , so that he can then drive around him to the basket . The main weakness cited in Wade 's ability is his lack of three-point range ; he has averaged .289 on three-point field goal attempts for his career . Wade is best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups , even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders . As crowd pleasing as his high-flying style of basketball may be , some have expressed concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner , as Wade has already hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players . Wade has also established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals . He became the NBA 's all-time leader in blocks for players listed 6 ' 4 \" ( 193 cm ) and under , which he achieved in only 679 games , over 400 games less than the previous record holder : Dennis Johnson ( 1100 ) . During the big three era , Wade has seen his overall offensive production decrease , a result of sharing the offense with LeBron James and Chris Bosh , but has succeeded at overall shooting a greater percentage despite taking less shots and playing more off the ball . = = NBA career statistics = = = = = Regular season = = = = = = Playoffs = = = = = Awards and honors = = 3 \u00d7 NBA champion : 2006 , 2012 , 2013 NBA Finals MVP : 2006 NBA scoring champion : 2009 NBA All-Star Game MVP : 2010 12 \u00d7 NBA All-Star : 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 8 \u00d7 All-NBA : First Team : 2009 , 2010 Second Team : 2005 , 2006 , 2011 Third Team : 2007 , 2012 , 2013 3 \u00d7 All-Defense : Second Team : 2005 , 2009 , 2010 NBA All-Rookie First Team : 2004 NBA All-Star Skills Challenge champion : 2006 , 2007 Gold medal with Team USA : 2008 Summer Olympic Games Bronze medal with Team USA : 2004 Summer Olympic Games Bronze medal with Team USA : 2006 FIBA World Championship Miami Heat all-time leading scorer Miami Heat all-time assists leader 2005 Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award 2006 Best NBA Player ESPY Award 2006 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year 2006 Sporting News Sportsman of the Year Wade won the 2012-13 season-long NBA Community Assist Award = = Personal life = = Wade married his high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002 .

Wade 's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash , which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O 'Neal who would sing , \" He 's the greatest in the Universe \" , in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film Flash Gordon . The Heat 's 2005 NBA Playoff run and Wade 's performances with Shaquille O 'Neal hampered by injury , led to an explosion of media attention and rapid increase in Wade 's popularity . During those playoffs , Wade 's jersey became the top selling jersey in the league and remained so for nearly two years .

During the 2009 \u2013 10 season , Wade switched from Converse to Nike 's Jordan Brand . Wade noted that the partnership ended on good terms , stating , \" When I came into the NBA , I didn 't have a lot of exposure and Converse gave me an opportunity to head a brand and be the face of a brand . I 'm really thankful for six long , good years . I 've gotten five shoes out of the deal and my dream came true at the Converse brand , because they put my name on a pair of sneakers . \" Wade was hand-chosen by Michael Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break . During the 2011 NBA Playoffs , Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand , joining fellow players Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul , who have their own signature shoes for the brand .

A native of Camden , South Carolina and three-sport all-state athlete while in high school in Paterson , New Jersey , Doby accepted a basketball scholarship from Long Island University . At 17 years of age , he began professionally playing baseball with the Newark Eagles as the team 's second baseman . Doby joined the United States Navy during World War II . His military service complete , Doby returned to baseball in 1946 , and along with teammate Monte Irvin , helped the Eagles win the Negro League World Series . In July 1947 , Doby joined Jackie Robinson in breaking the MLB color barrier . He became the first black player in the American League ( AL ) when he signed a contract to play with Bill Veeck 's Cleveland Indians . Doby was the first player to go directly to the majors from the Negro leagues . A seven-time All-Star center fielder , Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians won in 1948 . He helped the Indians win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954 , finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) award voting and was the AL 's RBI leader and home run champion . He went on to play for the Chicago White Sox , Detroit Tigers , and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player in 1962 . Doby later served as the second black manager in the majors with the Chicago White Sox , and in 1995 was appointed to a position in the AL 's executive office . He also served as a director with the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He was selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 by the Hall 's Veterans Committee and died in 2003 at the age of 79 . = = Early life = = Doby was born in Camden , South Carolina , to David Doby and Etta Brooks . Doby 's father served in World War I. He worked as a horse groomer and played semi-pro baseball , but drowned in an accident at age 37 in New York state . Doby 's mother , who had divorced David before his death , moved to Paterson , New Jersey ; Doby remained in Camden . He lived with his grandmother before moving to live with his father 's sister and brother-in-law from 1934 to 1938 . He attended Jackson School , which was segregated under South Carolina state law . His first opportunity to play organized baseball came as a student at Browning Home-Mather Academy , a private school affiliated with the Methodist church . Richard Dubose , who had managed Doby 's father and was known locally in African-American circles for his baseball expertise , gave Doby some of his first baseball lessons . Reflecting on his years growing up in South Carolina , including how he and playmates used worn down broom handles for bats , Doby said , \" Growing up in Camden , we didn 't have baseball bats . We 'd use a tree here , a tin can there , for bases . \" After completing eighth grade , Doby moved north to Paterson at the age of 14 to be reunited with his mother ; she visited him weekly while he lived with one of her friends . At Paterson Eastside High School , Doby was a multi-sport athlete ; as well as playing baseball and basketball , he was a wide receiver in football and lettered in track . After winning a state football championship , the Eastside team was invited to play in Florida , but the promoters would not allow Doby , the only black player on the team , to participate . Consequently , the team voted to forgo the trip as a gesture of support for Doby . During summer vacation Doby played baseball with a black semi-pro team , the Smart Sets , where he played with future Hall of Fame shortstop Monte Irvin . He also had a brief stint with the Harlem Renaissance , a professional basketball team , as an unpaid substitute player . Upon completing high school , he accepted an athletic scholarship to play basketball at Long Island University ( LIU ) . Doby had been dating Eastside classmate Helyn Curvy since his sophomore year and , according to Doby , being able to remain close to Paterson was the \" main reason \" he selected LIU . In the summer before he enrolled at LIU , Doby accepted an offer to play for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League ( NNL ) for the remainder of the 1942 season , and he transferred to Virginia Union University as a result . = = Negro leagues and World War II = = A Negro league umpire , Henry Moore , advised Newark Eagles ' owners Abe and Effa Manley to give Doby a tryout at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson , which was successful ; Doby joined the Eagles in 1942 at the age of 17 for $ 300 . The contract stated Doby would play until September when he would start classes at college ; to protect his amateur status he signed using the alias \" Larry Walker \" and local reporters were told he originated from Los Angeles , California . On May 31 , Doby appeared in his first professional game when the Eagles played against the New York Cubans at Yankee Stadium . In the 26 games where box scores have been found , Doby 's batting average was .391 . Doby recalled a game against catcher Josh Gibson and pitcher Ray Brown of the Homestead Grays : \" My first time up , Josh said , ' We 're going to find out if you can hit a fastball . ' I singled . Next time up , Josh said , ' We 're going to find out if you can hit a curveball . ' I singled . Third time up , Josh said , ' We 're going to find out how you do after you 're knocked down . ' I popped up the first time after they knocked me down . The second time , I singled . \" Doby 's career in Newark was interrupted for two years for service in the United States Navy . Doby spent 1943 and part of 1944 at Camp Robert Smalls at the Great Lakes Naval Training School near Chicago . He appeared on an all-black baseball squad and maintained a .342 batting average against teams composed of white players , some of which featured major leaguers . He then went to Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco Bay , California . Before serving in the Pacific Theater of World War II , Doby spent time at Navy sites in Ogden , Utah and San Diego , California . He was stationed on Ulithi in the Pacific Ocean in 1945 . Doby heard of Jackie Robinson 's minor league contract deal with the Montreal Royals of the International League from his base on Ulithi listening to Armed Forces Radio , and as a result Doby saw real hope in becoming a professional baseball player . While in Hawaii , Doby met fellow Navy man and future teammate Mickey Vernon . Vernon , then with the Washington Senators , was so impressed with Doby 's skills he wrote to Senators owner Clark Griffith , encouraging Griffith to sign Doby should the MLB ever allow integration . During his time in the Navy , Doby was described by his colleagues as quiet . Doby was discharged from the Navy in January 1946 . In the summer of that year , Doby and Helyn Curvy were married . After playing for the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico , Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946 . He made the All-Star roster , batted .360 ( fourth in the NNL ) , hit five home runs ( fifth ) and led the NNL in triples ( six ) . Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles , including Doby , Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis , to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season . For the Series , Doby hit .372 with one home run , five RBIs , and three stolen bases . Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier , not Robinson . On considering a career in the MLB , Doby said , \" I never dreamed that far ahead . Growing up in a segregated society , you couldn 't have thought that that was the way it was going to be . There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in ' 46 . \" = = Major League Baseball career = = = = = Integration of American League ( 1947 ) = = = Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942 , which had been informally segregated since the turn of the century , but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis . Veeck had begun the process of finding a young , talented player from the Negro leagues , and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians ' roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL . The reporter suggested Doby , of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School . Doby 's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues . Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck , reported Doby 's off-field behavior was not a concern . The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect . But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers ' Branch Rickey , who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League , Veeck used a different strategy , letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians ' farm system . He told the Pittsburgh Courier , \" One afternoon when the team trots out on the field , a Negro player will be out there with it . \" While Rickey declined to pay for the purchasing rights of Robinson while he played for the Kansas City Monarchs , Veeck was \" determined to buy Doby 's contract from the Eagles \" and had no problem paying purchasing rights . Effa Manley , business manager for the Eagles , believed her club 's close relationship with the New York Yankees might put Doby in a Yankees uniform , but they did not take interest in him . Veeck finalized a contract deal for Doby with Manley on July 3 . Veeck paid her a total of $ 15,000 for her second baseman \u2014 $ 10,000 for taking him from the Eagles and another $ 5,000 once it was determined he would stay with the Indians for at least 30 days . After Manley agreed to Veeck 's offer , she stated to him , \" If Larry Doby were white and a free agent , you 'd give him $ 100,000 to sign as a bonus . \" The press were not told that Doby had been signed by the Indians as Veeck wanted to manage how fans in Cleveland would be introduced to Doby . \" I moved slowly and carefully , perhaps even timidly \" , Veeck said . The Eagles had a doubleheader on July 4 but Doby , who had a .415 batting average and 14 home runs to that point in the season , only played in the first as Veeck sent his assistant and public relations personnel member , Louis Jones , for Doby . The two took a train from Newark to Chicago where the Indians were scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox the next day . On July 5 , with the Indians in Chicago in the midst of a road trip , Doby made his debut as the second black baseball player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line . Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park . Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby , who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career . Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop , while Joe Gordon was the second baseman . That day , Doby met his new teammates for the first time . \" I walked down that line , stuck out my hand , and very few hands came back in return . Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes , along with a look that said , ' You don 't belong here \" , Doby reminisced years later . Four of Doby 's teammates did not shake his hand , and of those , two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself . During warm-ups , Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another . Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage . Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team . Doby entered the game in the seventh inning as a pinch-hitter for relief pitcher Bryan Stephens and recorded a strikeout . In the 1949 movie The Kid from Cleveland , Veeck tells the story that Gordon struck out on three swings in his immediate at-bat after Doby to save face for his new teammate . However , Doby 's second strike was the result of a foul ball , both the Associated Press and Chicago Tribune stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three , and in addition , Gordon was standing on third base during Doby 's at-bat . From Pride and Prejudice : The Biography of Larry Doby : \" After the game , Doby quickly showered and dressed without incident in the Cleveland clubhouse . His escort , Louis Jones , then took him not to the Del Prado Hotel downtown , where the Indians players stayed , but to the black DuSable Hotel in Chicago 's predominantly black South Side , near Comiskey Park . The segregated arrangement established a pattern , on Doby 's first day , that he would be compelled to follow , in spring training and during the regular season , in many cities , throughout his playing career . \" The Indians had a doubleheader against the White Sox on Sunday , July 6 , for which 31,566 were in attendance ; it was estimated that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black . Some congregations of black churches let out early while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park . Boudreau had Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second , listed him a starter at first base , a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base . Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates , including first baseman Eddie Robinson , for whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day . Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman 's mitts did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected . The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player . Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby , but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein , Robinson obliged . It was the only game Doby started for the remainder of the season . Doby recorded his first major league hit in four at-bats and had an RBI in a 5 \u2013 1 Indians win . A columnist wrote in the Plain Dealer on July 8 : \" Cleveland 's man in the street is the right sort of American , as was evidenced right solidly once more by the response to the question : ' How does the signing of Larry Doby by the Indians strike you ? Said the man in the street : Can he hit ? ... That 's all that counts . \" Conversely , Doby was criticized from players both active and retired . Noted former player Rogers Hornsby said , after watching Doby play one time in 1947 : \" Bill Veeck did the Negro race no favor when he signed Larry Doby to a Cleveland contract . If Veeck wanted to demonstrate that the Negro has no place in major league baseball , he could have used no subtler means to establish the point . If he were white he wouldn 't be considered good enough to play with a semi-pro club . He is fast on his feet but that lets him out . He hasn 't any other quality that could possibly recommend him . \" In his rookie year , Doby hit 5-for-32 in 29 games . He played four games at second base and one each at first base and shortstop . Throughout the season he talked with Robinson via telephone , the two encouraging each other . \" And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn 't challenge anybody or cause trouble \u2014 or we 'd both be out of the big leagues , just like that . We figured that if we spoke out , we would ruin things for other black players . \" After his rookie season , Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948 . He was the first black player to join the league . = = = Cleveland Indians = = = = = = = 1948 \u2013 1950 = = = = In 1948 , Doby experienced his first spring training with the Indians in Tucson , Arizona . Unlike their white teammates , Doby , along with Satchel Paige and Minnie Mi\u00f1oso , were not permitted to stay at the nearby Santa Rita hotel but instead stayed with a local black family and used a rental car provided by the Indians for transportation . During spring training , Doby read books concerning outfield play , and received instruction and encouragement from former Indians manager Tris Speaker and Indians ' farm system director Hank Greenberg . Doby also credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him adjust to the majors and learning the outfield . In an exhibition game in Houston against the New York Giants , Doby hit a home run that \" may have traveled 500 feet before landing far beyond the fence in center field . \" As Moore wrote in his biography of Doby , \" With that home run , all doubts that Doby would make the 1948 Cleveland team vanished . That year , he played in 121 games and hit .301 for the season with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs . Throughout the regular season Doby was racially abused by opposing teams , and Veeck asked AL president Will Harridge for support in getting players to rein in their animosity towards Doby . Doby played a major role in Cleveland 's World Series victory against the Boston Braves . In Game 4 on October 9 , Doby hit the first home run by a black player in World Series history . A picture featuring an embrace between Doby and white teammate Steve Gromek , who had pitched a complete game that day , was on the cover of the next day 's Plain Dealer . Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the photograph \" a signature moment in the integration of Major League Baseball . \" Of the picture , Doby said , \" The picture was more rewarding and happy for me than actually hitting the home run . The picture finally showed a moment of a man showing his feelings for me . \" The Indians defeated the Braves in six games and with it , Cleveland had its first World Series championship since the 1920 season . Doby 's .318 batting average during the Series led the Indians . Nationally syndicated columnist Grantland Rice argued that without Doby and Gene Bearden , who had won 20 games that year , the Indians would have finished in fourth or fifth place . After the Series , Doby received a celebratory parade in Paterson , New Jersey , and during the offseason he , along with other teammates , appeared in the 1949 film The Kid From Cleveland . With additional income available due to the post-season run and Series championship , Doby and his wife attempted to buy a home in Paterson in an all-white neighborhood but were kept out by a petition from members of the community . The Dobys were allowed to purchase their desired home when the Paterson city mayor intervened on their behalf . During the 1949 season , Doby was selected to his first MLB All-Star Game . He was one of five Indians selected by Boudreau and joined Jackie Robinson , Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe as the first black players to be amongst those chosen to participate in the 1949 All-Star Game . Boudreau fined Doby after he attempted to steal home with no outs and bases loaded in a game against the Yankees on July 20 . Of the fine , Boudreau said , \" It was not based only on that attempt to steal home . Larry has taken several unnecessary chances lately . This should make him more careful . \" His home run ( 24 ) and RBI ( 85 ) totals increased during the 1949 season , and by 1950 , he was considered the best center fielder in the game by The Sporting News . By the first week in July , Doby 's .370 batting average trailed only 1949 AL batting champion George Kell , who had a .375 average . He earned career-bests in batting average ( .326 ) , hits ( 164 ) and on-base percentage ( OBP ) ( .442 ) , while playing in 142 games . Doby hit the 100-RBI mark ( 102 ) for the first time in his career while his OBP led the AL . He finished eighth in AL MVP voting , highest among outfielders . At the end of the season , Cleveland signed him to a new , more lucrative contract . Doby was named by Cleveland sports writers as the Cleveland Baseball Man of the Year after the season , the first time a black player was chosen . = = = = 1951 \u2013 1955 = = = = Doby hit 20 home runs and 69 RBIs in 1951 , both fewer than last season , and his batting average improved to .295 . His 21-game hit-streak was the second-longest for the Indians that season , behind Dale Mitchell 's mark of 23 games in a row . Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby 's salary due to the lower home run numbers despite Doby , who attributed the lower numbers to tightness in his legs , stating he would not accept a pay cut . Indians manager Al L\u00f3pez confirmed that Doby was injury-riddled throughout the season , stating that he \" was beset by first one injury and then another \" including \" a muscle tear in his thigh , a groin pull , an ankle twist . \" Doby received blame for the Indians ' failure to win the AL pennant and was labeled a \" loner \" by some in the press , including Plain Dealer sports editor Gordon Cobbledick who in an article in Sport wrote \" Larry 's a mixed-up guy \u2014 a badly mixed-up guy \" stemming from \" the emotional impact of discovering racial prejudice against him . \" Cobbledick also took issue with Doby 's assertion that opposing pitchers were knocking him down due to Doby being black . The assertion was confirmed by Sam Lacy , who wrote in the Baltimore Afro-American , \" Statistics show that eight colored players in the two major leagues were hit by pitches a total of 68 times during the 1951 campaign , an average of 8 1 \u2044 2 times per man . No other player was hit as many as eight times in the season . \" One month before spring training for the 1952 season , Doby employed former Olympic track and field athlete Harrison Dillard to come to his home in New Jersey to prepare his legs in hopes of eliminating injuries , which had affected him the previous season . Dillard and the Indians ' team doctor prescribed lower-body warm-ups to Doby before the start of each game . Leg injuries continued to bother Doby during the start of the season . On June 4 , 1952 , he hit for the cycle . By the end of the 1952 season , Doby was second in the AL in RBIs to teammate Al Rosen by one , 105 to 104 . His .541 slugging percentage , runs scored ( 104 ) , strikeout ( 111 ) , and home run ( 32 ) totals were all highest in the AL . Leading up to the 1953 season , Doby asked Greenberg and Indians management for a pay raise after earning $ 22,000 the previous season . In early March , the raise was granted , and he was slated to make $ 28,000 that year . For 1953 , Doby had a .263 batting average , which was his lowest since joining the league in 1947 . He led the AL in strikeouts for the second and final time in his career , a career-high 121 times , but hit 29 home runs and 102 RBIs on the year . He also had 96 walks , which was third in the AL . For the sixth time in his major league career , Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season , one of five Indians named . The game was held at Cleveland 's Municipal Stadium and featured the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game ( the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium ) . In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat , Doby hit a pinch-hit solo home run in the eighth inning to tie the game at 9 \u2013 9 ; the AL squad went on to win , 11 \u2013 9 . His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game . The game , which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998 , was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward . As the regular season resumed , Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant . His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL , which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting . The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby 's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants . In his last full season with the Indians in 1955 , Doby was selected for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game . Doby 's leg injuries affected him severely at this point in his career and he did not enter the game . He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting .291 in 131 games , his fewest played since 1948 . Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving . Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist , Franklin Lewis : \" He has been a controversial athlete . Highly gifted , he was frequently morose , sullen , and upon occasion , downright surly to his teammates ... He thought of himself , at the beginning , as the symbol of the Negro in his league . \" Doby responded , \" I was looked on as a Black man , not as a human being . I did feel a responsibility to the Black players who came after me , but that was a responsibility , basically , to people , not just to Black people . \" = = = Latter years ( 1956 \u2013 1960 ) = = = After spending nine seasons with Cleveland , Doby was traded on October 25 , 1955 , to the Chicago White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby . Chicago was looking for a consistent home run hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team . \" The search is over for a long ball hitter . We 've certainly needed a consistent one \u2014 and we 've been eying Doby for some time \" , said White Sox vice president Chuck Comiskey . White Sox manager Marty Marion believed Doby 's bat would be a welcome addition to his club when he said , \" The guy used to murder us when we played Cleveland . He 'll make a big difference in the number of one-run and two-run decisions we might lose . \" After winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22 , 1956 , Doby and the White Sox swept New York , the first time since the 1945 season the Yankees had been swept in a four-game series . The White Sox won eight straight games , the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season , and had done so with the help of Doby 's six home runs during the eight-game stretch . \" You know , when we dealt for Doby , we weren 't worried about Larry . We knew he 'd come through \" , Comiskey said . Doby finished the season with a .268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs . Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85 \u2013 69 record . In a game on August 20 , 1957 against the Washington Senators , Doby helped preserve pitcher Bob Keegan 's no-hitter with a backhand catch off a long line drive from Herb Plews , one of \" two close calls \" for Keegan that game . His 1957 home run total of 14 tied for the team-high , as he managed a .288 average and recorded 79 RBIs , second-highest on the team after former Indians teammate Minnie Mi\u00f1oso . The White Sox finished second in the AL with a 90 \u2013 64 record . Doby was part of a December 3 , 1957 , multi-player trade between the White Sox and Baltimore Orioles , then was traded again on April 1 to Cleveland along with Don Ferrarese for Gene Woodling , Bud Daley , and Dick Williams . He appeared in 89 games with the Indians that season and had a .289 batting average , 13 home runs , and 45 RBIs . He was sent to the Detroit Tigers on March 21 , 1959 , in exchange for Tito Francona . Tigers general manager Rick Ferrell said , \" this gives us some more power and we just hope Doby hits as well in Briggs Stadium this season as he has in other years . \" With the Tigers he appeared in 18 games and was the first black player to play for the Tiger franchise . He hit .218 with four RBIs before Detroit sold the 35-year-old Doby to the White Sox on May 13 for $ 20,000 . After 21 games with the White Sox , he was sent to Triple-A affiliate San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League after hitting .241 with no home runs and 9 RBIs . Doby fractured an ankle while sliding into third base after hitting a triple during a road game the Padres played against Sacramento , and was sent to a local hospital in Sacramento before going to Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation . Doby worked out with the White Sox before the 1960 season but , due to nagging injuries , did not earn a roster spot . In late April he joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League on a trial basis but was released by the team on May 6 after X-rays showed bone deterioration in his affected ankle . Doby finished his 13-year major league career with a .283 batting average , accumulated 1,515 hits , 253 home runs and 970 RBIs in 1,533 games and 5,348 at-bats . Of his 1,533 career games , 1,146 of them were spent with the Indians . \" I played against great talent in the Major Leagues and I played against great talent in the Negro Leagues . I didn 't see a lot of difference \" , said Doby . = = = Nippon baseball ( 1962 ) = = = Doby had participated in baseball clinics in 1962 as a member of a travel delegation from the U.S. Department of State . That year , Doby came out of retirement and became one of the first Americans to play professional baseball in Japan 's Nippon Professional Baseball league when he and Don Newcombe , a former teammate with the Newark Eagles , signed contracts with the Chunichi Dragons . After the season , Doby returned to the U.S. in October and resumed his work as a liquor retailer . = = Managerial and executive appointments = = After retiring as a player , Doby became a scout with the Montreal Expos in 1969 and served as a minor league instructor with the organization in 1970 . He was batting coach under manager Gene Mauch from 1971 to 1973 and again in 1976 . He managed various teams during five seasons of winter league baseball in Venezuela , including \u00c1guilas del Zulia during the 1970 \u2013 71 winter season . Doby rejoined the Indians for the 1974 season as first base coach for manager Ken Aspromonte . When Aspromonte was fired after the 1974 season , the Indians named Frank Robinson the club 's player-manager and baseball 's first black manager . After Robinson 's hire as manager , Doby returned to work for the Expos . In 1976 , Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team 's batting coach . As a team , the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a .255 batting average , 586 runs scored and 73 home runs . By June 29 , 1977 , the team 's average was .284 , and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs . They finished the season second in team batting average ( to the Yankees and Red Sox , each with a .281 average ) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team . After firing the White Sox 's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon , Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30 , 1978 . At age 53 , Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson . \" It 's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck . You just work as hard as you can , and if the opportunity arises , you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams \" , Doby said after being named White Sox manager . To that point in the season , the White Sox had a 34 \u2013 40 record . On July 1 in his first game as manager , the White Sox suffered a 10-0 loss to the Minnesota Twins but Doby won his first game , 8 \u2013 5 , the next day against the same team . The White Sox finished 71 \u2013 90 , including 37 \u2013 50 under Doby , in what would be Doby 's sole managerial role . Veeck hired player-manager Don Kessinger to succeed Doby after deciding not to re-hire Doby , although Kessinger resigned as manager in the second half of the 1979 season . After removing Doby from the manager 's role and reassigning him to batting coach , the position Doby held before being named manager , Veeck said , \" Larry will always have a role on this team in some capacity . \" He served in that role for one additional season and resigned in October 1979 . After retiring from baseball , Doby was named director of communications for the National Basketball Association 's New Jersey Nets from 1980 to 1989 and also served as the Nets ' director of community affairs until 1990 . Doby was named special assistant to the AL 's last president , Gene Budig , on April 17 , 1995 . = = Second man = = The New York Times wrote , \" In glorifying those who are first , the second is often forgotten ... Larry Doby integrated all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared . And he did it with class and clout . \" During the 1997 season , when the long-departed Jackie Robinson 's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball , and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media , an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did , and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support . Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote , in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson , \" Second place finishers in America are suckers . And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be . This happens sometimes in America . Those who don 't come first or don 't do things a certain way get lost . They disappear . \" \" Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it ( racial slurs ) . But it was the same thing I had to deal with . He was first , but the crap I took was just as bad . Nobody said , ' We 're gonna be nice to the second Black , ' \" Doby said . Doby served as one of the pallbearers at Robinson 's funeral . As fellow Hall of Famer Joe Morgan wrote , \" Anyone who knew Larry knew that he admired Robinson and was never jealous of the attention Robinson received . \" Former teammate Al Rosen said : \" Jackie was a college educated man who had been an officer in the service and who played at the Triple-A level . Jackie was brought in by Branch Rickey specifically to be the first black player in major league baseball . Larry Doby came up as a second baseman who didn 't have time to get his full college education , and was forced to play a different position in his first major league season . I think , because of those circumstances , he had a more difficult time than Jackie Robinson . I don 't think he has gotten the credit he deserves . \" Doby experienced many prejudices during his time before , during , and after the majors . One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him . Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field . He endured many racial slurs , from the stands and elsewhere , during games . He also received death threats . After he had retired as a player , Doby recalled memories of his days as a barrier-breaker . \" You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis ? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and when I came to bat , I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it . I felt like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name . You know most of them couldn 't afford to be there . I never forgot them . \" Shortly after the Indians had honored Doby by naming a nearby street after him , The Plain Dealer columnist Bill Livingston wrote , \" The Larry Doby way of pioneering was the same as the Jackie Robinson way in the National League , only Doby 's debut occurred six short weeks later and with almost no advance preparation by Doby or the Indians . \" Doby threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game , played at Jacobs Field . The decision to have the game in Cleveland coincided with the 1997 season marking the fiftieth anniversary of Robinson breaking baseball 's color barrier . It was also 50 years and 3 days since Doby became the first black player in the American League . = = Hall of Fame = = Doby was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on March 3 , 1998 , by the Veterans Committee at the age of 74 . \" This is just a tremendous feeling . It 's kind of like a bale of cotton has been on your shoulders , and now it 's off \" , said Doby . When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams . Upon hearing of Doby 's election , Gene Mauch , said , \" You have to be some kind of special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through . They both are . I 'm not too sure there 's a player in the game today who could handle it . \" He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on July 26 , 1998 . Doby became the first member born in South Carolina elected to the Hall . Although he was the first to play in MLB , Doby was the last member elected to the Hall of the four players to ever play in both a Negro league and MLB World Series , the others being Satchel Paige , Monte Irvin , and Willie Mays . = = Death and legacy = = Doby and his wife , Helyn , had five children , six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren . When the Dobys moved to Montclair , Yogi Berra and his wife became neighborhood friends and children of the two families played baseball and football together . Doby had a kidney removed in 1997 after a cancerous tumour was detected . Helyn , married to Doby for 55 years , died in 2001 after a six-month battle with cancer . Doby died on June 18 , 2003 , at his home in Montclair , New Jersey , at age 79 after suffering cancer . When Doby died , President George W. Bush made the following statement : \" Larry Doby was a good and honorable man , and a tremendous athlete and manager . He had a profound influence on the game of baseball , and he will be missed . As the first African American player in the American League , he helped lead the Cleveland Indians to their last World Series title in 1948 , became a nine-time All-Star and was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 . Laura joins me in sending our condolences to Larry 's family during this difficult time . \" MLB Commissioner Bud Selig ( 1998 \u2013 2015 ) released a statement a day following Doby 's death : \" ... Like Jackie , he endured the pain of being a pioneer with grace , dignity , and determination and eased the way for all who followed . He achieved another historic second 31 years later he became the second African-American to manage a big league club , following Frank Robinson . \" Former MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent said : \" Larry 's role in history was recognized slowly and belatedly . Jackie Robinson , who broke the color line first but in the same year , quite naturally received most of the attention . Larry played out his career with dignity and then slid gracefully into various front-office positions in basketball and then later in baseball . Only in the 90 's did baseball wake up to the obvious fact that Larry was every bit as deserving of recognition as Jackie . \" Long before Doby was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame came induction in the Indians Hall of Fame in August 1966 . Later , in May 1973 , he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame and in 2010 , the New Jersey Hall of Fame . On August 10 , 2007 , the Indians paid tribute to Doby on Larry Doby Day by collectively using his number ( 14 ) on their uniforms . The franchise again honored him when in 2012 , Eagle Avenue , next to the Indians ' Progressive Field , was renamed \" Larry Doby Way \" in an on-field postgame ceremony . Among those present at the ceremony were Jim \" Mudcat \" Grant , Indians president Mark Shapiro , Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson , and various members of Doby 's family . The city of Paterson , New Jersey , renamed the Eastside Park baseball field \" Larry Doby Field \" on June 1 , 2002 . The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center has a section named the Larry Doby Wing . Of Berra , Doby said , \" Yogi was one of the first opposing players to talk to me . As a catcher , Yogi talked to everybody . I finally had to tell the umpire : ' Please tell him to shut up . He asked me how my family was back in the first inning . ' \" In 2011 , the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players ( along with Ted Williams , Joe DiMaggio , and Willie Stargell ) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012 , as part of its \" Major League Baseball All-Stars \" series . The stamp was released July 21 , 2012 .",

He was the 65th man in history to reach sumo 's highest rank of yokozuna , and he won 22 tournament championships between 1992 and 2001 , the sixth highest total ever . The son of a popular \u014dzeki ranked wrestler from the 1970s , Takanohana 's rise through the ranks alongside his elder brother Wakanohana and his rivalry with the foreign born yokozuna Akebono saw interest in sumo and attendance at tournaments soar during the early 1990s . Takanohana was the youngest ever to reach the top division at just 17 , and he set a number of other age-related records . He had a solid but aggressive style , looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents ' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring . He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri , or force out . In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries , and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30 . He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and a senior member of the Japan Sumo Association . = = Background = = Takanohana comes from a family with a great sumo history , sometimes called the \" Hanada Dynasty . \" His uncle Wakanohana Kanji I was a yokozuna from 1958 to 1962 , and his father Takanohana Kenshi had held the second highest rank of \u014dzeki for a then record 50 tournaments from 1972 to 1981 . Upon his retirement his father established the training stable ( heya ) Fujishima stable . The young K\u014dji Hanada had been practising sumo since elementary school and won the equivalent of a yokozuna title at junior high school . Upon his graduation in 1988 he formally joined his father 's stable . His elder brother Masaru had been planning to complete high school but dropped out so as not to lag behind his brother . = = Early career = = Takanohana and his brother made their professional debuts together in March 1988 , with future rival Akebono also beginning his career in the same month . The two brothers had to move from the family quarters in the stable and join the communal room with all the other new recruits . They were also instructed not to refer to their parents as \" father \" and \" mother \" any more but as \" oyakata \" and \" okamisan \" ( coach and coach 's wife ) . K\u014dji initially wrestled under the name Takahanada , and it was understood that he would only be allowed to adopt his father 's shikona of Takanohana ( meaning noble flower ) when he reached the champion \u014dzeki rank . Their early career attracted much publicity , with each divisional promotion regarded by the media as part of an inevitable rise to the top ranks . Takahanada 's progress was rapid and he set numerous age-related records , including the youngest ever makushita division tournament champion ( 16 years 9 months ) , youngest ever promoted to the second highest j\u016bry\u014d division ( 17 years 3 months ) , and the youngest ever promoted to the top makuuchi division ( 17 years 8 months ) . In March 1991 , in his fourth top division tournament , Takahanada was runner-up with twelve wins , and became the youngest ever sansh\u014d or special prize winner , receiving awards for Fighting Spirit and Technique . In the following tournament in May 1991 he defeated veteran yokozuna Chiyonofuji in a match watched by 44 percent of the Japanese population on TV , and became the youngest ever to defeat a yokozuna . Chiyonofuji retired two days afterwards . In January 1992 , he became the youngest ever top division tournament champion ( 19 years 5 months ) . He was too young to drink the celebratory sake at the after tournament party , and had to make do with oolong tea instead . After his second championship in September 1992 , followed by two good scores of 10-5 and 11-4 in the next two tournaments , he was promoted to \u014dzeki in January 1993 , the same tournament in which Akebono was elevated to yokozuna . During this period the two brothers created a so-called \" Waka-Taka boom \" and were credited with restoring sumo 's popularity , particularly amongst younger audiences . Interest in sumo rose to its highest level since the era of Futabayama in the 1930s , with official tournaments ( honbasho ) selling out of tickets for every day . Both Takahanada and his brother became sex symbols . = = Promotion to yokozuna = = Now known as Takanohana , he was also the youngest ever to be promoted to \u014dzeki at 20 years 5 months . With the foreign born Akebono as sumo 's only yokozuna , there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up . However , his lack of consistency , and Akebono 's dominance , delayed his promotion to yokozuna . He won his third championship in May 1993 , but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July , and even produced a make-koshi or losing score of 7-8 in November . In 1994 , a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems , Takanohana won the January and May tournaments , but was then outshone by Musashimaru , who won in July with a perfect 15-0 record . After taking the September 1994 championship , Takanohana now had six top division titles , but none had been won consecutively . No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo 's highest rank . The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament , but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority , the first time this had happened in twenty five years . They insisted that two consecutive championships were required , having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion . In November 1994 , Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments , with his second consecutive unbeaten 15-0 score , and his promotion was confirmed . He had been at the \u014dzeki rank for 11 tournaments , or nearly two years . However , at 22 years and 3 months , he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time . = = Yokozuna career = = = = = 1995 \u2013 1997 = = = Takanohana 's total of seven tournament championships by the start of 1995 was the same as the total won by Akebono , who had reached the yokozuna rank two years before him . However , Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival . He was at his peak as a yokozuna between 1995 and 1997 , during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered , finishing runner-up in the other six . He produced two more perfect scores of 15-0 , in September 1995 and September 1996 . Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995 , 70 out of 75 in 1996 , and 78 out 90 in 1997 , far ahead of any other wrestler . In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period , he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs : once to Wakanohana and twice to \u014dzeki Takanonami . Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same heya meeting in regular tournament bouts ( playoffs excepted ) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also sekiwake Akinoshima and Takat\u014driki . The merger of his father 's Fujishima stable with his uncle 's Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list , giving him an advantage over Akebono , who had to face them all . By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships , and was still only 24 years old . However , after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour , he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness . = = = 1998 \u2013 2000 = = = Takanohana was affected by a liver disorder in the first half of 1998 , which caused him withdraw from the January 1998 tournament and miss the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Nagano ( his place was taken by Akebono ) . He pulled out of the March 1998 tournament as well and was still below his best in May . Shunning the traditional treatment methods available from his stable , he turned instead to a physical therapist called Tashiro Tomita , who had a considerable influence over him . He became increasingly isolated from his father and brother , with his father claiming Takanohana had been \" brainwashed \" by Tomita . Despite his brother 's promotion to yokozuna that year , creating the first ever sibling grand champions , the two were barely on speaking terms . Takanohana recovered to win the July and September 1998 tournaments , and was runner-up that November . In 1999 , however , he was even more badly affected by injuries , including a dislocated shoulder , and managed only one score in double figures all year . After making peace with his family , Takanohana regained some of his consistency in 2000 , although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury suffered in the July tournament . His brother had retired in March , and several other members of his stable were now past their best . With Akebono dominant once more his best results that year were two runner-up performances . = = = 2001 \u2013 2003 = = = Takanohana won his first tournament in over two years in January 2001 , winning his first fourteen bouts and then defeating fellow yokozuna Musashimaru in a playoff on the final day . He won his final championship in May 2001 , again in a playoff against Musashimaru , but it came at a great cost . He had suffered serious knee ligament damage in a loss to Mus\u014dyama on the 14th day but he insisted on fighting on to the end of the tournament . As a result , he then missed an unprecedented seven consecutive tournaments , undergoing surgery in Paris in July 2001 and having a lengthy recuperation after that . Takanohana finally returned to the ring in September 2002 , after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire . He finished behind Musashimaru on 12-3 , the 16th time he had been a tournament runner-up . Considering how long he had been away , it was seen as an impressive comeback . However , he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury . He made another comeback in January 2003 , making a late decision to compete . A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days , and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement . He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo . His father spoke of his relief at the decision , after seeing his son battle through so many injuries . Takanohana 's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history , behind only Taih\u014d , Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time . Junichiro Koizumi , the Prime Minister , was among those paying tribute . His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era . Takanohana 's danpatsu-shiki , or official retirement ceremony , was held at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan on June 1 , 2003 . The ceremony , and the party held afterwards at the Imperial Hotel , were both broadcast live on Fuji TV . = = Fighting style = = Takanohana was largely a yotsu-sumo wrestler , favouring techniques which involved grabbing his opponent 's mawashi or belt . His preferred grip was migi-yotsu ( right hand inside , left hand outside his opponent ) . His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri , a simple force out , which accounted for 52 percent of his victories . He also regularly employed uwatenage , or overarm throw , and this was the technique he used to defeat Asash\u014dry\u016b in the second of their two meetings , in September 2002 . = = Retirement from sumo = = After his retirement he became an elder ( or member ) of the Japan Sumo Association . Because of his great achievements in sumo he was given a bonus of 130 million yen and was also made a \" one generation \" elder without having to purchase a share in the Association . This enabled him to keep his fighting name and he is now known as Takanohana Oyakata . With his father 's health failing , he took over the operation of his training stable in January 2004 , renaming it Takanohana stable . Its last sekitori , Takanonami retired shortly afterwards . During 2008 , he added four new recruits to his stable , the first for several years , bringing the total number of wrestlers in his charge up to ten . These include his first foreign recruit , a Mongolian with amateur sumo experience named Takanoiwa , and two twins . In July 2012 Takanohana produced his first sekitori level wrestler when Takanoiwa was promoted to the second highest j\u016bry\u014d division . He won the j\u016bry\u014d championship in January 2013 and a year later was promoted to the top makuuchi division . Takanohana became a shimpan or judge of tournament bouts in February 2004 , only a year after his retirement , a role for which elders normally have to wait at least four years . After the election of the Association 's Board of Directors in February 2008 , the Association appointed Takanohana as Associate Manager of Judging ( \u5be9\u5224\u90e8\u526f\u90e8\u9577 , shimpanbu-fukubuch\u014d ) , replacing former yokozuna Chiyonofuji ( Kokonoe-oyakata ) who was elected to serve the Board as a director . For an organization that tends to follow seniority over achievement in its organization appointment , it was highly unusual for them to place a 35-year-old to such an influential position . However both former yokozuna , Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji whom Takanohana is often compared to , served a stint as Associate Manager of Judging prior to their becoming the Board director . In February 2009 he was moved from the judging department to the jungy\u014d ( regional tour ) department , a less high-profile position . Takanohana mentioned in October 2009 that he was interested in running for a spot on the Board of Directors in the February 2010 elections , and confirmed in January that he would stand , despite the fact that this would mean opposing the two officially sanctioned candidates of the Nishonoseki ichimon or group of stables . As a result , Takanohana and six of his supporters , \u014ctake ( the former Takat\u014driki ) , Futagoyama ( the former Dairyu ) , Otowayama ( the former Takanonami ) , Tokiwayama ( the former Takamisugi ) , \u014cnomatsu ( the former Masurao Hiroo ) , and Magaki ( the former Wakanohana II ) left the Nishonoseki ichimon . Takanohana told a press conference , \" I will leave the faction . I bid farewell to everyone in my greetings at the meeting . I have stepped into the race as a candidate . \" The first contested elections since 2002 , they took place by secret ballot on February 1 , and Takanohana was elected to the board , replacing \u014cshima . Seen as a reformer , he favours revamping the current ticket sales system and improving support for ex-rikishi , as well as encouraging sumo in primary schools , raising the pay of gy\u014dji , yobidashi and tokoyama , and making public the Sumo Association 's accounts and assets . His victory was praised by the Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama , who said Takanohana had let in \" a new wind of change . \" In 2014 , the JSA made the decision to recognize the Takanohana group formed from the stables ousted in 2010 , as an official ichimon . In July 2010 , in the wake of a scandal involving several wrestlers admitting to illegal gambling , he denied he had connections with members of the yakuza underworld after media reports that he was seen with a mobster during a visit to Ehime prefecture to recruit new apprentices . Following the election of Hanaregoma as the new head of the Sumo Association in August 2010 , Takanohana returned to the judging department as director of judging . The following month he and his wife were awarded \u00a5 8.47 million in damages by the Tokyo High Court over 13 articles published by the Shukan Gendai and Gekkan Gendai in 2004 and 2005 concerning match-fixing allegations and the controversy over his father 's inheritance . Having reached a peak weight of 160 kg ( 350 lb ) as an active wrestler , he has lost a great deal of weight since his retirement ( more than retired wrestlers typically do ) and is now around 90 kg ( 200 lb ) . In 2009 he published a book detailing his weight loss methods . = = Relationship with family = = The Hanada family had generally received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers , with the press holding them up as the ideal Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them . Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy and the outside world had been noted , with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and Wakanahona having a warmer personality . However , upon their father 's death from cancer in May 2005 , a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media . Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity , but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother , as is traditional . However , with their father reported to have left no will , it was suggested that the feud revolved around control of his estate . Takanohana also condemned his mother for her extramarital affair , which led to her divorce from Futagoyama and exit from the stable in July 2001 , and had only been rumoured up to that point . She has now reverted to her old name of Noriko Fujita and published a book and appeared on TV , revealing details of life as a stablemaster 's wife that are seldom heard outside the sumo world . Takanohana has rarely spoken to her since . In June 2008 he spoke of his distress at the news that she had been named as a defence witness in a civil lawsuit brought by the Sumo Association against the tabloid magazine Sh\u016bkan Gendai over allegations that his father benefited from a thrown match for the championship in 1975 , saying , \" she will essentially be fighting against me . \" He said he would take responsibility by resigning from the Sumo Association if she took the stand . In a radio interview Fujita said she would not testify , saying , \" I will not drag my child down \" . = = Marriage = = In late 1992 Takanohana announced his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa , news which sparked a similar amount of coverage to the royal wedding held that year . However the engagement was broken off the following year , reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana 's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife . The role of the wife of a head coach in looking after the stable 's recruits and liaising with supporter 's groups is regarded as a full-time job . In May 1995 Takanohana married television announcer Keiko Kono , eight years older than him . The couple have a son and two daughters . = = Career record = =",

                    "text": "Bouldering = Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses . While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever , most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds , chalk to keep their hands dry , and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls . Unlike free solo climbing , which is also performed without ropes , bouldering problems ( the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb ) are usually less than 6 meters ( 20 ft . ) tall . Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders . Bouldering competitions , which employ a variety of formats , take place in both indoor and outdoor settings . The sport originated as a method of training for roped climbs and mountaineering . Bouldering enabled climbers to practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground . Additionally , the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength . Throughout the 1900s , bouldering evolved into a separate discipline . Individual problems are assigned ratings based on their difficulty . There have been many different rating systems used throughout the history of the sport , but modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the Fontainebleau scale . The growing popularity of the sport has caused several environmental concerns , including soil erosion and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off-trail to reach bouldering sites . This has caused some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether . = = Overview = = Bouldering is a form of rock climbing which takes place on boulders and other small rock formations , usually measuring less than 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) from ground to top , but in some cases can measure up to 30 + ft . Unlike top rope climbing and lead climbing , no ropes are used to protect or aid the climber . Bouldering routes or \" problems \" require the climber to reach the top of a boulder , usually from a specified start position . Some boulder problems , known as \" traverses , \" require the climber to climb horizontally from one position to another . The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed . Granite , for example , often features long cracks and slabs . Sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks . Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock . There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States , including Hueco Tanks in Texas , Mount Evans in Colorado , and The Buttermilks in Bishop , California . Squamish , British Columbia is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada . Europe also hosts a number of bouldering sites , such as Fontainebleau in France , Albarrac\u00edn in Spain , and various mountains throughout Switzerland . = = = Indoor bouldering = = = Artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment , usually at climbing gyms . These walls are constructed with wooden panels , polymer cement panels , concrete shells , or precast molds of actual rock walls . Holds , usually made of plastic , are then bolted onto the wall to create problems . The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces , forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength . Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall . In the US the most common method Routesetters use to designate the intended route for a particular problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold \u2014 for example , holds with red tape would indicate one bouldering problem , while green tape would be used to set off a different problem in the same area . Across much of the rest of the world problems and grades are usually designated by using a set color of plastic hold to indicate a particular problem . For example , green may be v0-v1 , blue may be v2-v3 and so on . Setting via color has certain advantages , the most notable of which are that it makes it more obvious where the holds for a problem are , and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off of footholds . Smaller , resource-poor climbing gyms may prefer taped problems because large , expensive holds can be used in multiple routes simply by marking them with more than one color of tape . = = = Competitions = = = Bouldering competitions occur in both indoor and outdoor settings . The International Federation of Sport Climbing ( IFSC ) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds : qualifications , semi-finals , and finals . The rounds feature different sets of four or five boulder problems , and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem . At the end of each round , competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems , with ties settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the problems . There are several other formats used for bouldering competitions . Some competitions give climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between each attempt , unlike the IFSC format , in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose . In an open-format competition , all climbers compete simultaneously , and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible . More points are awarded for more difficult problems , while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem . In 2012 , the IFSC submitted a proposal to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to include lead climbing in the 2020 Summer Olympics . The proposal was later revised to an \" overall \" competition , which would feature bouldering , lead climbing , and speed climbing . In May 2013 , the IOC announced that climbing would not be added to the 2020 Olympic program . = = History = = Rock climbing first emerged as a sport in the mid-1800s . Early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering , not as a separate discipline , but as a form of training for larger ascents . In the early 20th century , the Fontainebleau area of France established itself as a prominent climbing area , where some of the first dedicated bleausards ( or \" boulderers \" ) emerged . The specialized rock climbing shoe was invented by one such athlete , Pierre Allain . In the 1960s , the sport was pushed forward by American mathematician John Gill , who contributed several important innovations . Gill 's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics , a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions . He applied this idea to bouldering , which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds . Gill developed a closed-ended rating system : B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time , B2 problems were more difficult , and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once . Gill introduced chalk as a method of keeping the climber 's hands dry . He also emphasized the importance of strength training to complement technical skill . Neither of these practices had been popular among climbers , but as Gill 's ability level and influence grew , his ideas became the norm . Two important training tools emerged in the 1980s : Bouldering mats and artificial climbing walls . The former , also referred to as \" crash pads \" , prevented injuries from falling , and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous to attempt otherwise . Indoor climbing walls helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing , and allowed serious climbers to train year-round regardless of weather conditions . As the sport grew in popularity , new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States , and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions . The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s , as YouTube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques , find hard problems , and announce newly completed projects . In early 2010 , two American climbers claimed first ascents on boulder problems that have come to be regarded as the most difficult in the world : The Game near Boulder , Colorado , established by Daniel Woods ; and Lucid Dreaming near Bishop , California , established by Paul Robinson . The following year , fellow American Carlo Traversi claimed the second ascent of The Game and in January 2014 , American Daniel Woods completed the second ascent of \" Lucid Dreaming . \" In 2011 , Czech climber Adam Ondra claimed the second ascent of Gioia , originally established three years earlier by Italian boulderer Christian Core , and suggested that it was among the world 's most challenging boulder problems . = = Equipment = = Unlike other climbing sports , bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment , an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers . Bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that \" The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders \" . Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag as the bare minimum , while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of shoes , chalk , brushes , crash pads , and a skincare kit . Of the aforementioned equipment , climbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance . Besides protecting the climber 's feet from rough surfaces , climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure and maintain footholds . Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear , and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork . They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations : High-top shoes , for example , provide better protection for the ankle , while low-top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement . Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges , whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity . The front of the shoe , called the \" toe box \" , can be asymmetric , which performs well on overhanging rocks , or symmetric , which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs . Most boulderers use gymnastics chalk on their hands to absorb sweat . It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist , allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb . Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs ; they are often attached to the end of a stick , pipe , or other straight object in order to reach higher holds . Crash pads , also referred to as bouldering mats , are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls . = = Safety = = Boulder problems are generally shorter than 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) from ground to top . This makes the sport significantly safer than free solo climbing , which is also performed without ropes , but with no upper limit on the height of the climb . However , minor injuries are common in bouldering , particularly sprained ankles and wrists . Two factors contribute to the frequency of injuries in bouldering : first , boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines , making falls more common . Second , without ropes to arrest the climber 's descent , every fall will cause the climber to hit the ground . To prevent injuries , boulderers position crash pads near the boulder to provide a softer landing , as well as one or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads . Upon landing , boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics : spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures , and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact . = = Technique = = As with other forms of climbing , bouldering technique is largely centered on proper footwork . Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles ; thus , proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning , relying on their legs to push them up the boulder . Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible , allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles . Bouldering movements are described as either \" static \" or \" dynamic \" . Static movements are those that are performed slowly , with the climber 's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs . Dynamic movements use the climber 's momentum to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically , with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately . = = Grading = = Bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by routesetters and climbers . The two most widely used rating systems are the V-scale and the Fontainebleau system . The V-scale , which originated in the United States , is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty . The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts . The scale begins at V0 , and as of 2013 , the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V16 . Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems . The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system , with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters a , b , and c . For example , Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6 , while Fontainebleau 7C + is equivalent to V10 . In both systems , grades are further differentiated by appending \" + \" to indicate a small increase in difficulty . Despite this level of specificity , ratings of individual problems are often controversial , as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber . Height , arm length , flexibility , and other body characteristics can also be relevant . = = Environmental impact = = Bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks , such as mosses and lichens . This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder , or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds . Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse , particularly by climbers laying down crash pads . Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails , or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer . Other environmental concerns include littering , improperly disposed feces , and graffiti . These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering , as was the case in Tea Garden , a popular bouldering area in Rocklands , South Africa .",

                    "text": "Fatbeard = \" Fatbeard \" is the seventh episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series South Park . The 188th overall episode of the series , it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 22 , 2009 and in the United Kingdom on April 24 , 2009 . It was the mid-season finale , marking the final South Park episode for six months . In the episode , Cartman misinterprets news reports about piracy in the Indian Ocean to mean the return of the classic era of swashbuckling pirates , and misleads a handful of South Park boys to voyage to Mogadishu to start a pirate crew . The episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker , and was rated TV-MA L in the United States for strong to extreme language . \" Fatbeard \" was a reference to increasing international media attention to piracy in the Indian Ocean , and the script depicted the pirates in a sympathetic light . The crew of the USS Bainbridge , the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer which participated in the rescue of the hijacked MV Maersk Alabama , contacted the South Park creators to praise them for the episode . \" Fatbeard \" received generally positive reviews and was seen by 2.59 million households in its original broadcast , making it the most-watched Comedy Central production the week it aired . = = Plot = = Having misunderstood the news about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean , Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned , and asks the boys to join him in becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise . Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all , Kyle encourages him to go , even offering to help pay for his ticket . Although Butters , Ike , Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew , an undaunted Cartman uses his mother 's credit card to book a trip to Somalia . After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride , the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates . Once there , however , they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land , the complete opposite of their expectations . They quickly find the pirates , who are shocked that anyone would knowingly venture into their base . The pirates decide to ransom the boys to the first European vessel they find . The boys confidently go with them , believing they are being taken to a pirate ship , but are once again disappointed when they are taken to a small motorboat . Eventually , the pirates find a French schooner and demand a ransom of five thousand euros in exchange for the boys ' lives . Meanwhile in South Park , Kyle happily claims partial credit for sending Cartman to Somalia and expects things will be better without Cartman around . But when his parents discover a farewell letter from Ike , Kyle realizes his brother has run off with Cartman to Somalia , and he sets off for Mogadishu to bring his brother home . Back in Somalia , the ransom is paid and the boys are surrendered . Once on board , however , Cartman assumes control of the schooner and orders the crew to get onto the lifeboat . Although the captain initially refuses , Kevin brandishes a toy lightsaber , frightening the French crew into abandoning ship . Cartman and the boys return to Mogadishu with the captured vessel , giving several bundles of Euros to the pirates . The pirates are initially shocked , but begin to respect Cartman . Unimpressed by their lack of \" pirate \" traits , he in turn leads them in raiding ships via a traditional sea shanty called \" Somalian Pirates , We \" , and starts fashioning them into a stereotypical pirate crew . Meanwhile , the French crew is rescued by a cargo ship , and the U.S. Navy is deployed by NATO after getting word from the cargo ship captain that the pirates now have \" advanced weaponry \" ( which was really just Kevin 's toy lightsaber , that the French crew thought was real ) . Kyle arrives in Mogadishu , but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage . He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave , but Cartman refuses , believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life . Meanwhile , an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates . When they say that they left because they were tired of things like school , chores , homework , and being yelled at by adults , Guleed responds by telling them that he dreamed of a simple life going to school , and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated , and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family . He never set out to be a pirate , but was forced into piracy to support his family . Realizing how close-minded they 've been , Butters and Ike admit that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering , not fun and adventure like normal life can be . They then tell Cartman that they want to return home , but he refuses to give up his romantic delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint . However , Cartman 's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers , who shoots all of Cartman 's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads . This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed . = = Production = = \" Fatbeard \" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 22 , 2009 and was the mid-season finale , marking the final South Park episode until October 2009 . \" Fatbeard \" is based on real-life piracy in the Indian Ocean , which began receiving increasing international media attention in 2008 until its demise in 2012 / 2013 . The episode began production two weeks before its airdate , with the intention to broadcast it on April 15 , 2009 . The writing team had developed the idea for Cartman mistaking Somalian piracy for classic piracy amid the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama at the time . Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage in the event , and Parker and Stone decided to hold the episode indefinitely , although animation had begun . Realizing the severity of the situation \u2014 if Phillips were killed and the South Park episode seemed to mock the situation \u2014 they decided to resume work on the episode \" Pinewood Derby \" , which had been in production for a while , as the creators had no idea to where to go with its story . When Phillips was rescued over the weekend , they wanted to resume work on \" Fatbeard \" , but as animation work on the episode proved difficult , including new sets depicting Somalia , it was decided it would be unfeasible . The episode 's ending was unusual , as many episodes of South Park tend to resolve the episode 's events ; in \" Fatbeard \" , the main characters don 't return home and are shown at the end still in Somalia . An alternate ending made it to the animatic stage , in which Cartman , in a self-referential manner , congratulates the show on the conclusion of the season and invites the season 's celebrity parodies ( among those the Jonas Brothers and Kanye West ) . The ending , which Parker likened to that of a variety show , was something he felt was funny in writing but didn 't succeed visually . While most South Park episodes feature Parker and Stone providing almost all the voice acting , \" Fatbeard \" included several French-speaking actors providing the lines of the schooner crew . Outside voice actors were also brought in for the role of the Somalian pirates , including Abdi Fatah Adawe , Dahir Ali , Abdullahi Prime , and Julien Zeitouni . The week after its original broadcast , in response to requests by fans , the full 90-second version of episode 's sea shanty song , \" Somalian Pirates , We \" was made available for download on South Park Studios , the official South Park website . Shortly after \" Fatbeard \" was originally broadcast , the site also featured six different types of T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode . = = Themes = = The ending , in which the pirates are each shot to death by American snipers , reflects the resolution of the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009 , where U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each . They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending . Travis Fickett of IGN said , \" It 's one of those moments where South Park feels the need to give voice to a side the media is ignoring \u2014 and points out that things aren 't quite as cut and dry [ sic ] as we might like . \" The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted . A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to \" not hit the white ones \" has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy . = = Cultural references = = Ike indicates he will \" vomit my balls out through my mouth \" if he has to hear anything more about Susan Boyle , the Scottish amateur singer who gained worldwide attention around the time of the episode 's airing for her performance of the song \" I Dreamed a Dream \" from Les Mis\u00e9rables on the show Britain 's Got Talent . The Boyle reference in particular received a great deal of media attention the week \" Fatbeard \" first aired . Cartman says that Jewish people , Mexicans , and ginger-haired people are not allowed to be pirates . The French schooner crew members are portrayed as pretentious cowards , a stereotype of the French based on the government 's surrender during World War II . The schooner itself strongly resembles the French luxury yacht Le Ponant , which was seized by Somali pirates in April 2008 . Cartman refers to Blackbeard , the famous English pirate from the 17th and 18th centuries , from whom the episode derives its name . Much of the d\u00e9cor and music in the episode is influenced by the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride and associated film franchise . Kevin wields a toy lightsaber , the Jedi weapon from the Star Wars films ; this is also a reference to the sixth season episode \" The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers \" , in which he dresses as an Imperial stormtrooper while the rest of the boys are in Lord of the Rings attire . = = Reception = = In its original American broadcast , \" Fatbeard \" was watched by 2.59 million overall households , according to the Nielsen ratings , making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week . The episode received generally positive reviews . Carlos Delgado of If magazine , who gave the episode an A- grade , particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending \" perfect \" . Delgado said of the show 's creators , \" These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the news desk . And because South Park can be made in like a week \u2014 and I \u2019 m talking start to finish , from concept to finished product \u2014 they end up being the most socially conscious and timely show on television today . \" Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song , and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings . Sean O 'Neal of The A.V. Club said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline , but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing : \" Rather than a cobbled-together collection of gags , everything progressed very organically . \" IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional . Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel and the extent to which Cartman 's delusion about pirates takes him , but he said the pirate plot \" isn 't entirely in good taste ( and ) it never really gathers a full head of steam \" . The crew of the USS Bainbridge , the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer which participated in the rescue of Richard Phillips from the hijacked MV Maersk Alabama , contacted the creators of South Park to commend them on the episode . Ensign Jonathan Sieg , the Bainbridge public relations officer , wrote : \" Pretty much everyone onboard our ship \u2014 from Captain to seaman \u2014 is a huge fan of South Park , and when we heard about the episode Fatbeard , as you can imagine , we were thrilled and very interested to watch . \" Sieg requested copies of the episode because the streaming online video was difficult to watch on the ship , and the South Park staff in return sent them a care package including several copies of the episode . On the official South Park Studios FAQ , they wrote back , \" No , sir , thank you . We were honored to read that , and making an episode about you kicking pirate booty was our pleasure . \" = = Home release = = \" Fatbeard \" , along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park 's thirteenth season , were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16 , 2010 . The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode , a collection of deleted scenes , and a special mini-feature Inside Xbox : A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios , which discussed the process behind animating the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson .",

                    "text": "Polikarpov I-5 = The Polikarpov I-5 was a single-seat biplane which became the primary Soviet fighter between its introduction in 1931 through 1936 , after which it became the standard advanced trainer . Following Operation Barbarossa , which destroyed much of the Soviet Air Forces ( VVS ) , surviving I-5s were equipped with four machine guns and bomb racks and pressed into service as light ground-attack aircraft and night bombers in 1941 . They were retired in early 1942 as Soviet aircraft production began to recover and modern ground-attack aircraft like the Ilyushin Il-2 became available . A total of 803 built ( including 3 prototypes ) . = = Development = = The 1928 Five-Year Plan ordered the Tupolev design bureau to develop a mixed-construction ( metal and wood / fabric ) biplane fighter powered by a Bristol Jupiter VII engine with the first prototype completed by 1 September 1929 . The new fighter was designated I-5 ( Istrebitel ' \u2014 Fighter ) , but had the internal Tupolev designation of ANT-12 . Concurrently , Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov 's group was tasked with creating a wood-construction aircraft designated as the Polikarpov I-6 to the same specification . The I-5 design , begun by Pavel Sukhoi , under the supervision of Andrei Tupolev , lagged because the Tupolev bureau was preoccupied with large bombers . As the result the I-5 and I-6 projects were unified in 1929 under Polikarpov 's leadership , although neither project met its specified completion date . Nikolai Polikarpov was arrested by the OGPU in September 1929 for the crime of industrial sabotage for these failures and sentenced to death , although this was commuted to ten years imprisonment in a labor camp . In December 1929 the OGPU gathered a number of aircraft engineers together at Butyrka prison , including Polikarpov , and formed the Internal Prison Design Bureau ( Konstruktorskoye Byuro Vnutrenniya Tyurma \u2014 KB VT ) under the leadership of Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich . The KB VT was transferred to quarters on the grounds of Factory ( Zavod ) Nr. 30 in Moscow-Khodinka in early 1930 . Shortly afterwards Polikarpov replaced Grigorovich as the head designer when his concept for the I-5 was approved by the OGPU . The full-scale mock-up was approved on 28 March 1930 and the first prototype , designated VT-11 ( Vnutrenniya Tyurma \u2014 Internal Prison ) , was completed a month later . It made its first flight on 30 April 1930 and was fitted with an imported supercharged 450-horsepower ( 340 kW ) Jupiter VII . It was painted in silver with a red cheat line ; a red \" VT \" was superimposed on the red star on the rudder . The second prototype , known as the VT-12 , had a Jupiter VI engine , and took to the air on 22 May , bearing the name \" Klim Voroshilov . \" The two prototypes also differed in minor details regarding the shape of the tail and the construction of the landing gear . All this meant a slight difference in weight and performance between the two prototypes was present , with the second being slightly heavier and faster , while the first had a slight range advantage and a higher service ceiling . The third prototype , designated as the VT-13 and inscribed with \" A Gift for the XVIth Congress of the Party \" , was powered by a 600-horsepower ( 450 kW ) Soviet-built M-15 engine with a NACA cowling , but this proved to be unreliable and was not put into production . The second prototype passed its State acceptance trials on 13 August 1931 and was ordered into production a month later on 13 September . One problem noted during the trials was a tendency to make an uncontrolled 180 \u00b0 turn when landing in light winds . Shortening the landing gear by 15 cm ( 5.9 in ) and moving them 12 cm ( 4.7 in ) cured the problem . The engineer who suggest the change was awarded the Order of the Red Star for his ingenuity . Ten pre-production aircraft had already been ordered and they were assembled between August and October . They all had imported engines fitted , but trialled various small improvements for the production aircraft that included cooling vents for the crankcase , introduction of a pitot tube and static vent in the starboard upper wing , a faired headrest for the pilot , and a metal propeller whose pitch could be adjusted on the ground . = = Design = = The I-5 was a single-seat biplane with staggered wings in a sesquiplane configuration with fixed landing gear and a tailskid . The aircraft was of mixed construction , with the fuselage being made of a framework of welded steel tubes covered by a fabric skin over the rear fuselage , with the front fuselage section being covered by detachable duralumin panels as far back as the rear of the cockpit . There were also detachable panels allowing easy access to the tailskid shock absorber . The fabric skin was laced for tightness and the seams were covered with calico . A fireproof bulkhead separated the 165 litres ( 36 imp gal ; 44 US gal ) fuel tank from the engine and a fire extinguisher was fitted with outlets to the fuel pump , inlet pipe and carburetor . The conventional landing gear was connected by a one-piece axle and some aircraft were fitted with teardrop-shaped spats covering the wheels . Initially the tailskid was fixed , but later aircraft had smaller skids that moved in concert with the rudder . Rubber rings were used as shock absorbers on the landing gear . The wings were built with two spars . The upper wing was made in three parts , with the middle section being of duralumin and the outer ones being made of wood . The wooden lower wings were built in single sections , using a G\u00f6ttingen-436 profile . The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings , and attached the upper wing to the fuselage , had a teardrop profile and were reinforced with steel bracing wires . Laced lacquered fabric covered the empennage and wings , except for the roots of the lower wings which were covered in plywood and the leading edges of the wings were skinned in duralumin for the first 150 cm ( 59 in ) . Ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing . All movable control surfaces and the tail section were built with doped fabric over metal framing . Bracing wires above and below the tail were fitted on the prototypes , but production aircraft replaced the lower wires with a strut on each side . The horizontal tail was offset 3.5 mm ( 0.14 in ) to port to compensate for the engine 's torque , but it could be adjusted on the ground . Some early production aircraft had imported Bristol Jupiter VI engines with a metal cowling , but the bulk of the production aircraft used the M-22 license-built copy , both of 480 horsepower ( 358 kW ) , with a Townend ring . Early aircraft usually had a fixed-pitch wooden propeller with a diameter of 2.9 meters ( 9 ft 6 in ) , but these were replaced by a 2.7 meters ( 8 ft 10 in ) duralumin propeller without a spinner that could have its pitch adjusted on the ground . Two synchronized 7.62-millimeter ( 0.300 in ) PV-1 machine guns were fitted in the fuselage with 600 rounds apiece with an OP-1 telescopic sight . It was hoped to fit another pair , but the extra weight adversely affected the aircraft 's performance during tests . Two small Der-5 underwing bomb racks were fitted that could carry one 10-kilogram ( 22 lb ) bomb apiece . Beam-type bomb racks were evaluated on the I-5 that could carry a pair of 250-kilogram ( 551 lb ) bombs , but these had such adverse effects on its performance that they were rejected for service use . One of the tests with these racks had the aircraft diving down upon the target ; the first example of dive bombing in the Soviet Union . The I-5 was also used to evaluate the accuracy of the RS-82 rocket , although they are not known to have been used by the aircraft in service . I-5s called up during the emergency in 1941 were converted for use as fighter-bombers by adding two more machine guns , and some aircraft were fitted with the heavy bombs that had been rejected earlier . The ground-attack version is sometimes referred to as the I-5LSh . Test pilot Mark Gallai described the flying qualities of the I-5 thus : \" After flying it I was convinced that the I-5 is quite a handful , a capricious aircraft . However , if you are careful with the controls and do not offend the machine with rough actions , it will not depart controlled flight . \" = = Operational history = = 54 I-5s were delivered to the VVS by 1 October 1931 , and 66 by the end of the year . These were all aircraft from Zavod Nr. 1 at Khodinka , but Zavod Nr. 21 in Gorkii began deliveries the following year . It delivered ten in 1932 , 321 in 1933 and 330 in 1934 . Zavod Nr. 1 delivered 76 in 1932 before beginning production of the Heinkel HD 37 as the I-7 . The I-5 was first delivered to units in the Leningrad , Ukraine and Transbaikal Military Districts and comprised 20 % of the VVS 's fighter force by the end of 1932 . During 1933 deliveries began to units in the Far Eastern , Belorussian and Moscow Military Districts and they comprised 40 % of the fighter strength by the end of the year . By the end of 1934 most of the Polikarpov I-3s and Tupolev I-4s had been replaced and deliveries had begun to Naval Aviation . The I-5 began to be replaced by the Polikarpov I-15 in 1936 , and was completely phased out from front-line use by the end of 1937 , but continued to be employed as an advanced trainer . Following the German Invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , the heavy losses of front-line aircraft endured by the VVS together with the disruption of aircraft production resulted in I-5s being removed from training units and returned to combat service as ground-attack aircraft or night bombers until early 1942 . Some I-5s were used by the 605th and 606th Fighter Regiments ( Istrebitel 'nyye Aviatsionyye Polki ( IAP ) ) during the defence of Moscow as night bombers until re-equipping in February 1942 . The 2nd Ground Attack Regiment ( Shturmovoy Aviatsionyye Polki ( ShAP ) ) was raised in September 1941 in the Crimea from reservists and the Kachin Flying School . By 10 October thirty-two I-5s were on hand , although attrition had reduced them to sixteen serviceable . They were down to a total of a dozen aircraft by 18 October . They served until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was withdrawn for conversion to Ilyushin Il-2s and redesignated as the 766th ShAP . The 11th ShAP was raised by the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet on 22 September 1941 . On 18 October it mustered eighteen serviceable and fifteen unserviceable I-5s , although this was reduced to eleven serviceable and eight unserviceable aircraft by 7 November . It kept the I-5s in service until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was reorganized . = = Variants = = The I-5 was involved in tests of the Zveno project where a Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber carried three I-5s as parasite fighters . One I-5 was carried was on each wing and a third over the fuselage . Ramps were used to get the wing-mounted aircraft to their places , but the fuselage-mounted aircraft had to be lifted by hand . This was so cumbersome that they were generally used solely as an extra powerplant for the TB-3 later in the program . The aircraft used in these trials used the longer landing gear with smaller tires originally used in the prototypes . A two-seat conversion trainer , designated the I-5UTI ( Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy Istrebitel ' \u2014 Fighter Trainer ) , was built by one of the factories . Only about twenty are believed to have been built . The cockpit was moved back and a second one inserted in front of it . = = Users = = Soviet Union VVS Naval Aviation = = Specifications = = Data from Gordon and Dexter , Polikarpov 's Biplane Fighters , p . 22 General characteristics Crew : 1 Length : 6.78 m ( 22 ft 3 in ) Upper wingspan : 10.24 m ( 33 ft 7 in ) Lower wingspan : 7.4 m ( 24 ft 3 in ) Wing area : 21.3 m2 ( 229 sq ft ) Airfoil : G\u00f6ttingen-436 Empty weight : 934 kg ( 2,059 lb ) Gross weight : 1,355 kg ( 2,987 lb ) Fuel capacity : 165 Powerplant : 1 \u00d7 Shvetsov M-22 9-cylinder , single-row radial engine , 358 kW ( 480 hp ) Propellers : 2-bladed duralumin , 2.7 m ( 8 ft 10 in ) diameter Performance Maximum speed : 278 km / h ( 173 mph ; 150 kn ) at sea level Range : 660 km ( 410 mi ; 356 nmi ) Service ceiling : 7,500 m ( 24,606 ft ) Time to altitude : 1.6 minutes to 1,000 metres ( 3,300 ft ) Horizontal turn time : 10 sec Armament Guns : 2 \u00d7 7.62-mm PV-1 machine guns Bombs : 2 \u00d7 22-lb ( 10-kg )",

                    "text": "Mikoyan-Gurevich I-250 = The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-250 ( a.k.a. Samolet N ) was a Soviet fighter aircraft developed as part of a crash program in 1944 to develop a high-performance fighter to counter German turbojet-powered aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me-262 . The Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau decided to focus on a design that used something more mature than the jet engine , which was still at an experimental stage in the Soviet Union , and chose a mixed-power solution with the VRDK ( Vozdushno-Reaktivny Dvigatel Kompressornyi \u2013 air reaction compressor jet ) motorjet powered by the Klimov VK-107 V12 engine . While quite successful when it worked , with a maximum speed of 820 km / h ( 510 mph ) being reached during trials , production problems with the VRDK fatally delayed the program and it was canceled in 1948 as obsolete . = = Design and development = = By January 1944 the Soviets were aware of successful British and American jet aircraft projects and that the Germans were about to deploy jet and rocket-propelled aircraft of their own . The GKO ordered on 18 February that the NKAP ( People 's Commissariat for Aviation Industry ) centralize jet research under its control and that the NKAP was to present proposals to alleviate the situation within a month . As a result of this meeting the NKAP ordered the Lavochkin , Sukhoi , Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureaux ( OKBs ) to develop and build jet aircraft with the utmost dispatch . Aware of earlier problems encountered with other novel propulsion systems such as ramjets both Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich chose to use the VRDK booster engine that had been under development since 1942 . The VRDK was a motorjet , a rudimentary type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine 's compressor . It forced air into the stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle . In the I-250 a 1,650-horsepower ( 1,230 kW ) Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine was used as the primary powerplant . After takeoff a clutch at the end of the crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13 : 21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK . The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner , thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft . This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine , but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it . A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107 's supercharger ; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine 's output to 2,500-horsepower ( 1,900 kW ) at 7,000 m ( 22,966 ft ) . The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine 's excess heat into the exhaust stream . However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes ' operating time per sortie , which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight . The I-250 was a low-wing , all-metal aircraft with a monocoque fuselage . Other than the VRDK the aircraft was largely conventional in layout , although the cockpit was set very far back in the fuselage , almost to the base of the vertical tail . The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10 % to preserve aileron control and avoid tip stall . They were fitted with Frise ailerons and slotted flaps . Fuel was contained in a 412-litre ( 91 imp gal ; 109 US gal ) fuselage tank and a 100-litre ( 22 imp gal ; 26 US gal ) tank in each wing . The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a levered suspension and retracted inwards . The tail wheel retracted aft into the very small ventral fin . The VK-107A engine initially drove a 3.1-metre ( 10 ft ) VISh-105SV propeller . The NKAP had asked Mikoyan to begin preliminary design work on a high-altitude interceptor in January 1944 , but ordered two prototypes of an all-metal interceptor using the VRDK for testing in February and March 1945 . The aircraft was to reach an altitude of 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) in 4.5 minutes with full power and 5.5 minutes using the piston engine alone . Its maximum speed was to be 810 km / h ( 500 mph ) at 7,000 m ( 22,966 ft ) with full power and 700 km / h ( 430 mph ) at 7,000 m ( 22,966 ft ) using the VK-107 by itself . Its intended armament was one 23 mm ( 0.91 in ) autocannon and two 12.7 mm ( 0.50 in ) machine guns . To assist Mikoyan TsAGI was ordered to provide help with aerodynamic and stress calculations and to test a full-size mockup in their wind tunnel in one month 's time . TsIAM was ordered to deliver three VRDK engines with 9-kilonewton ( 2,000 lbf ) at 7,000 m ( 22,966 ft ) with a specific fuel consumption of 1,200 kg ( 2,600 lb ) per hour . The plane was designated I-250 by the NKAP ; but the internal OKB designation was N. The NKAP approved the preliminary specifications of the I-250 on 19 September 1944 which included a maximum speed of 825 km / h ( 513 mph ) a take-off weight of 3,500 kg ( 7,700 lb ) and a time to 5,000 metres ( 16,404 ft ) of 3.9 minutes . A mock-up was inspected on 26 October and rejected because of the poor cockpit layout , although this decision was reversed because the fuselage of the first prototype was too far along for major changes that would have significantly delayed the program . That same month the combustion chamber was sent to TsIAM for testing which revealed it to be too weak . The complete powerplant was tested in December , but the drive shaft connecting them failed several times . The first prototype was completed on 26 February 1945 , although the VRDK was not yet ready . It was fitted with a new 3.1-metre ( 10 ft ) AV-10P-60 propeller before making its first flight on 4 April according to Gordon and Komissarov , although Belyakov and Marmain say 3 March . It was armed with three 20 mm Berezin B-20 cannon with 160 rounds each . One gun was fitted on each side of the nose and the third fired through the hollow propeller shaft . The VRDK was tested for the first time on 8 April in a dive , attaining a speed of 710 km / h ( 440 mph ) , but a leak was found in the oil cooler after landing and the VRDK had to be returned to the factory for repairs . The VRDK was reinstalled by 14 April , but was still troublesome . It twice reached 809 km / h ( 503 mph ) at about 7,000 m ( 22,966 ft ) during these early tests , but its service life had been exceeded by 30 May and it had to be returned to TsIAM , which postponed any further tests until the second aircraft was finished . The unarmed second prototype was completed on 19 May , but did not make its first flight until 26 May . It was later discovered to have several major defects , including an oil leak from the VRDK compressor 's sleeve . The VRDK 's designer was summoned in an attempt to solve its problems although not all of these were design issues . The first prototype was grounded for most of June to remedy magneto problems and to add extra air intakes to cool the spark plugs . It attained a speed of 820 km / h ( 510 mph ) at 6,700 m ( 21,982 ft ) on 3 July . Unfortunately its port tailplane failed at low altitude two days later , killing the test pilot , Alexandr Deyev , when his parachute failed to open in time . Post-crash analysis revealed that he had exceeded the airframe 's G limit while maneuvering . Despite the accident , a pre-production batch of ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 as it was felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones . At the same time Sukhoi 's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250 . In the meantime the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July . The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by 0.63 m2 ( 6.8 sq ft ) , but this was just one of numerous problems , and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant . However , the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair . The order for the pre-production I-250s had been placed with Factory No. 381 in Moscow for two aircraft to be delivered in September , three more in October and the remainder by the end of the year . This proved to be very optimistic and it was revised to a single aircraft by the end of the year . The airframe was completed on this revised schedule , but its engine was not ready in time . The factory management was much criticized for these problems which were not entirely under their control as changes to the design and drawings were constant . The criticism was not limited to just the I-250 program as the other jet programs could not be developed as fast as the leadership wanted as well and Alexei Shakhurin , the head of MAP ( Ministry of Aviation Industry ) and its NKAP predecessor since 1940 , was arrested in March 1946 as a sign of their displeasure . The new Minister severely reprimanded the designer of the VRDK and three factory directors on 13 April 1946 and set up a commission to determine why Factory No. 381 and TsIAM had failed to meet their deadlines . He refused to accept its findings as it apportioned blame fairly evenly among those responsible for the production program and he had the director of Factory No. 381 and his quality control manager arrested for industrial sabotage . Despite these production problems and the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails , an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February ( these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13 , which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service ) . A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft , but it was stymied , again , for a lack of an engine . By this time seven airframes had been completed , but all lacked engines . The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later , although its engine seals failed and a number of ignition cables were scorched . The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display . It was handed over to the NII VVS ( Air Force Institute ) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests . All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October , although construction number 3810107 ( Factory No. 381 , first batch , seventh aircraft ) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed . Stalin convened a meeting on 29 November 1946 to settle the future policy on jet fighters for the VVS and PVO . The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 was selected as the primary fighter with the Yakovlev Yak-15 relegated to conversion training and familiarization . The imminent availability of British jet engines and access to German jet technology and engineers meant that there was no longer any need for mixed-power aircraft , but Stalin insisted that the I-250 finish its trials and that the tooling and drawings should be retained along with unassembled parts even though the program was cancelled . Completion of the trials would be delayed until May 1947 when the trials of the VRDK itself would be completed and Mikoyan tried to sell the aircraft to Naval Aviation for use as escorts for torpedo bombers . Additional fuel tanks were fitted in the wings and fuselage of 3810102 to carry an additional 218 litres ( 48 imp gal ; 58 US gal ) of fuel and the capacity of the oil tank was increased to 78 litres ( 17 imp gal ; 21 US gal ) . These changes increased its empty weight to 3,028 kg ( 6,676 lb ) and its take-off weight to 3,931 kg ( 8,666 lb ) . A new round of State trials began on 9 October 1947 , but these were delayed by bad weather and reliability issues . Only six flights totaling two hours and twenty-five minutes had been completed by 21 January 1948 and the VRDK had only been run for a minute and half during a ground test . The I-250 was unsurprisingly declared to have failed the trials on 3 April 1948 . = = Specifications ( first prototype ) = = Data from Gordon and Komissarov , OKB Mikoyan : A History of the Design Bureau and its Aircraft General characteristics Crew : 1 Length : 8.19 m ( 26 ft 10 in ) Wingspan : 9.5 m ( 31 ft 2 in ) Height : 3.7 m ( 12 ft 2 in ) Wing area : 15 m2 ( 160 sq ft ) Empty weight : 2,797 kg ( 6,166 lb ) Gross weight : 3,680 kg ( 8,113 lb ) Fuel capacity : 612 litres ( 135 imp gal ; 162 US gal ) Powerplant : 1 \u00d7 Klimov VK-107R liquid-cooled V12 engine , 1,230 kW ( 1,650 hp ) Powerplant : 1 \u00d7 VRDK ( Vozdushno-Reaktivny Dvigatel Kompressornyi \u2013 air reaction compressor jet ) motorjet , 6 kN ( 1,300 lbf ) thrust Propellers : 3-bladed AV-10P-60 , 3.1 m ( 10 ft 2 in ) diameter Performance Maximum speed : 820 km / h ( 510 mph ; 443 kn ) Range : 790 km ( 491 mi ; 427 nmi ) Service ceiling : 11,900 m ( 39,042 ft ) Time to altitude : 5,000 m ( 16,400 ft ) in 3.9 min ( with VRDK ) Wing loading : 245 kg / m2 ( 50 lb / sq ft ) Armament Guns : 3 \u00d7 20 mm Berezin B-20 cannons ( 160 rounds each )",

                    "text": "Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor = The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation , single-seat , twin-engine , all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . The result of the USAF 's Advanced Tactical Fighter program , the aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter , but also has ground attack , electronic warfare , and signals intelligence capabilities . The prime contractor , Lockheed Martin , built most of the F-22 's airframe and weapons systems and did its final assembly , while Boeing provided the wings , aft fuselage , avionics integration , and training systems . The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F / A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A . After a protracted development and despite operational issues , the USAF considers the F-22 critical to its tactical air power , and says that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter . The Raptor 's combination of stealth , aerodynamic performance , and situational awareness gives the aircraft unprecedented air combat capabilities . The high cost of the aircraft , a lack of clear air-to-air missions due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs , a ban on exports , and development of the more versatile F-35 led to the end of F-22 production . A final procurement tally of 187 operational production aircraft was established in 2009 and the last F-22 was delivered to the USAF in 2012 . = = Development = = = = = Origins = = = In 1981 the U.S. Air Force developed a requirement for an Advanced Tactical Fighter ( ATF ) as a new air superiority fighter to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon . Code named \" Senior Sky \" , this program was influenced by the emerging worldwide threats , including development and proliferation of Soviet Su-27 \" Flanker \" - and MiG-29 \" Fulcrum \" -class fighter aircraft . It would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon , including composite materials , lightweight alloys , advanced flight control systems , more powerful propulsion systems , and stealth technology . The request for proposals ( RFP ) was issued in July 1986 and two contractor teams , Lockheed / Boeing / General Dynamics and Northrop / McDonnell Douglas , were selected on 31 October 1986 to undertake a 50-month demonstration phase , culminating in the flight test of two technology demonstrator prototypes , the YF-22 and the YF-23 . Each design team produced two prototype air vehicles , one for each of the two engine options . The Lockheed-led team employed thrust vectoring nozzles on YF-22 for enhanced maneuverability in dogfights . The ATF 's increasing weight and cost drove out certain requirements during development . Side-looking radars were deleted , and the dedicated infra-red search and track ( IRST ) system was downgraded from multi-color to single color and then deleted as well . However , space and cooling provisions were retained to allow for future addition of these components . The ejection seat requirement was downgraded from a fresh design to the existing McDonnell Douglas ACES II . After the flight test demonstration and validation of the prototypes , on 23 April 1991 , Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 as the winner of the ATF competition . The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster while the YF-22 was more maneuverable . The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more adaptable to the U.S. Navy 's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter ( NATF ) , but by 1992 , the Navy had abandoned NATF . = = = Production and procurement = = = Prime contractor Lockheed Martin Aeronautics manufactured the majority of the airframe and performed final assembly at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta , Georgia ; program partner Boeing Defense , Space & Security provided additional airframe components as well as avionics integration and training systems . F-22 production was split up over many subcontractors across 46 states to increase Congressional support , though this production split may have contributed to increased costs and delays . Many capabilities were deferred to post-service upgrades , reducing the initial cost but increasing total program cost . Production supported over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers and up to 95,000 jobs . The F-22 had several design changes from the YF-22 . The swept-back angle of the leading edge was decreased from 48 \u00b0 to 42 \u00b0 , while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20 % . To improve pilot visibility , the canopy was moved forward 7 inches ( 18 cm ) , and the engine intakes moved rearward 14 inches ( 36 cm ) . The shapes of the wing and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics , strength , and stealth characteristics . Increasing weight during development caused slight reductions in range and aerodynamic performance . The first F-22 , an engineering and manufacturing development ( EMD ) aircraft named Raptor 4001 , was unveiled at Marietta , Georgia , on 9 April 1997 , and first flew on 7 September 1997 . In 2006 , the Raptor 's development team , composed of over 1,000 contractors and the USAF , won the Collier Trophy , American aviation 's most prestigious award . The F-22 was in production for 15 years , at a rate of roughly two per month during peak production . The USAF originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs at a cost of $ 26.2 billion , with production beginning in 1994 . The 1990 Major Aircraft Review led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996 . By 1997 , funding instability had further cut the total to 339 , which was again reduced to 277 F-22s by 2003 . In 2004 , the Department of Defense ( DoD ) further reduced this to 183 operational aircraft , despite the USAF 's preference for 381 . In 2006 , a multi-year procurement plan was implemented to save $ 15 billion but raise each aircraft 's cost . That year the program 's total cost was projected to be $ 62 billion for 183 F-22s distributed to seven combat squadrons . In 2007 , Lockheed Martin received a $ 7.3 billion contract to increase the order to 183 production F-22s and extend manufacturing through 2011 . In April 2006 , the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) assessed the F-22 's cost to be $ 361 million per aircraft , with $ 28 billion invested in development and testing ; the Unit Procurement Cost was estimated at $ 178 million in 2006 , based on a production run of 181 aircraft . It was estimated by the end of production , $ 34 billion will have been spent on procurement , resulting in a total program cost of $ 62 billion , around $ 339 million per aircraft . The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at about $ 138 million in 2009 . The GAO stated the estimated cost was $ 412 million per aircraft in 2012 . = = = Ban on exports = = = The F-22 cannot be exported under American federal law to protect its stealth technology and other high-tech features . Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter , which contains technology from the F-22 but was designed to be cheaper , more flexible , and available for export . In September 2006 , Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales . Despite the ban , the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant , and another report on the effect of F-22 export sales on U.S. aerospace industry . Some Australian politicians and defense commentators proposed that Australia should attempt to purchase F-22s instead of the planned F-35s , citing the F-22 's known capabilities and F-35 's delays and developmental uncertainties . However , the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) determined that the F-22 was unable to perform the F-35 's strike and close air support roles . The Japanese government also showed interest in the F-22 for its Replacement-Fighter program . The Japan Air Self-Defense Force ( JASDF ) would reportedly require fewer fighters for its mission if it obtained the F-22 , thus reducing engineering and staffing costs . However , in 2009 it was reported that acquiring the F-22 would require increases to the defense budget beyond the historical 1 percent of GDP . With the end of F-22 production , Japan chose the F-35 in December 2011 . Israel also expressed interest , but eventually chose the F-35 because of the F-22 's price and unavailability . = = = Production termination = = = Throughout the 2000s , the need for F-22s was debated due to rising costs and the lack of relevant adversaries . In 2006 , Comptroller General of the United States David Walker found that \" the DoD has not demonstrated the need \" for more investment in the F-22 , and further opposition to the program was expressed by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England , Senator John McCain , and Chairman of U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services Senator John Warner . The F-22 program lost influential supporters in 2008 after the forced resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley . Nevertheless , in 2008 , Congress passed a defense spending bill funding the F-22 's continued production and the Pentagon released $ 50 million of the $ 140 million for four additional aircraft , raising the total orders for production aircraft to 187 and leaving the program in the hands of the next administration . In November 2008 , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the Raptor was not relevant in post-Cold War conflicts such as in Iraq and Afghanistan , and in April 2009 , under the new Obama Administration , he called for ending F-22 production in fiscal year ( FY ) 2011 , leaving the USAF with 187 production aircraft . In July , General James Cartwright , Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , stated to the Senate Committee on Armed Services his reasons for supporting termination of F-22 production . They included shifting resources to the multirole F-35 to allow proliferation of fifth-generation fighters for three service branches and preserving the F / A-18 production line to maintain the military 's electronic warfare ( EW ) capabilities in the Boeing EA-18G Growler . Issues with the F-22 's reliability and availability also raised concerns . After President Obama threatened to veto further production , the Senate voted in July 2009 in favor of ending production and the House subsequently agreed to abide by the 187 production aircraft cap . Gates stated that the decision was taken in light of the F-35 's capabilities , and in 2010 , he set the F-22 requirement to 187 aircraft by lowering the number of major regional conflict preparations from two to one . In 2010 , USAF initiated a study to determine the costs of retaining F-22 tooling for a future Service Life Extension Program ( SLEP ) . A RAND Corporation paper from this study estimated that restarting production and building an additional 75 F-22s would cost $ 17 billion , resulting in $ 227 million per aircraft or 54 million higher than the flyaway cost . Lockheed Martin stated that restarting the production line itself would cost about $ 200 million . Production tooling will be documented in illustrated electronic manuals stored at the Sierra Army Depot . Retained tooling will produce additional components ; due to the limited production run there are no reserve aircraft , leading to considerable care during maintenance . Later attempts to retrieve this tooling found that the containers were empty . Russian and Chinese fighter developments have fueled concern , and in 2009 , General John Corley , head of Air Combat Command , stated that a fleet of 187 F-22s would be inadequate , but Secretary Gates dismissed this concern . In 2011 , Gates explained that Chinese fifth-generation fighter developments had been accounted for when the number of F-22s was set , and that the U.S. would have a considerable advantage in stealth aircraft in 2025 , even with F-35 delays . In December 2011 , the 195th and final F-22 was completed out of 8 test and 187 operational aircraft produced , the aircraft was delivered to the USAF on 2 May 2012 . In April 2016 , the HASC Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee proposed legislation that would direct the Air Force \" to conduct a comprehensive assessment and study of the costs associated with resuming production of F-22 aircraft . \" Defense Secretary Robert Gates had production halted at 187 F-22s ( at a cost of $ 67 billion ) to direct funds for ongoing irregular warfare operations in Iraq and Afghanistan . Since then , lawmakers and the Pentagon have noted that air warfare systems of Russia and China are catching up to U.S. air superiority capabilities . The bill notes that Air Combat Command has a stated requirement for 381 F-22s from initial program objectives of 749 aircraft , and would require reviewing of anticipated future air superiority capacity and capability requirements , estimated costs to restart F-22 production , and other measures . In addition to identifying the cost of building another 194 aircraft , the report must also consider the possibility of the 1998 prohibition on the export of the F-22 being repealed . Previous estimates of restarting production placed figures at around $ 2 billion , including $ 300 \u2013 500 million in non-recurring start-up costs , with an estimated unit cost of $ 233 million for a production run of 75 aircraft over five years . Lockheed has proposed upgrading the 36 early training-model Block 20 Raptors into combat-coded Block 30 / 35 versions as a way to increase numbers available for deployment . = = = Upgrades = = = The first combat-capable Block 3.0 aircraft first flew in 2001 . Increment 2 , the first F-22 upgrade program , was implemented in 2005 and enables the aircraft to employ Joint Direct Attack Munitions ( JDAM ) . Increment 3.1 provides improved ground-attack capability through synthetic aperture radar mapping and radio emitter direction finding , electronic attack and the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb ( SDB ) ; testing began in 2009 and the first upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2012 . Increment 3.2 is a two-part upgrade process ; 3.2A focuses on electronic warfare , communications and identification , while 3.2B will allow the F-22 to fully exploit the AIM-9X and AIM-120D missiles . The subsequent Increment 3.3 may include the adoption of an open avionics platform and air traffic control updates . Upgrades due in 2015 will allow the F-22 to employ the AIM-9X and have full Link 16 reception and transmission capability , and an upgrade scheduled in 2018 will integrate the AIM-120D into the weapons suite . The F-22 fleet is planned to have 36 Block 20 training and 149 Block 30 / 35 combat aircraft by 2016 . The Increment 3.2B upgrade planned for 2018 will include a new stores management system to show the correct symbols for the AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120D AMRAAM and improved control of them . To enable two-way communication with other platforms , the F-22 can use the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node ( BACN ) as a gateway . The originally planned MADL integration was cut due to the lack of system maturity . In 2014 Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman were competing to connect the F-22 with other platforms while maintaining stealth . Other upgrades being developed include infra-red search and track functionality for the AN / AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector ( MLD ) and integration of a helmet-mounted cuing system ( HMCS ) to enable off-boresight missile launches by 2020 . Until the F-22 gains a helmet mounted system it will use the AIM-9X 's helmetless high off-boresight ( HHOBS ) capabilities . In March 2010 , the USAF accelerated software portions of 3.2 to be completed in FY 2013 . In January 2011 , the USAF opened the Raptor enhancement , development and integration ( REDI ) contract to bidders , with a $ 16 billion budget . In November 2011 , Lockheed Martin 's upgrade contract ceiling was raised to $ 7.4 billion . Nearly $ 2 billion was allocated for structural repairs and to achieve fleet availability rate of 70.6 % by 2015 . However , only 63 % was achieved . Some F-35 technology , such as more durable stealth coatings , have been applied to the F-22 . By 2012 , the update schedule had slipped seven years due to instability in requirements and funding . In 2014 the USAF moved to cut upgrade funding . In 2012 the F-22 was upgraded with a backup oxygen system , software upgrades and oxygen sensors to address the frequent oxygen deprivation issues and normalize operations . In 2013 , the faulty flight vest valves were replaced and altitude restrictions lifted ; distance restrictions will be lifted once a backup oxygen system is installed . In April 2014 the USAF stated in Congressional testimony that installation of automatic backup oxygen systems on the F-22 fleet would be completed within twelve months . The F-22 was designed for a lifespan of 30 years and 8,000 flight hours , with a $ 100 million \" structures retrofit program \" . Investigations are being made for upgrades to extend their useful lives further . In the long term , the F-22 is expected to be superseded by a sixth-generation jet fighter to be fielded in the 2030s . = = Design = = = = = Overview = = = The F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF . It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise , supermaneuverability , stealth , and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform . The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear , four empennage surfaces , and a retractable tricycle landing gear . Flight control surfaces include leading and trailing-edge flaps , ailerons , rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers , and all-moving horizontal tails ; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes . The aircraft 's dual Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 afterburning turbofan engines are closely spaced and incorporate pitch-axis thrust vectoring nozzles with a range of \u00b1 20 degrees ; each engine has maximum thrust in the 35,000 lbf ( 156 kN ) class . The F-22 's thrust to weight ratio in typical combat configuration is nearly at unity in maximum military power and 1.25 in full afterburner . Maximum speed without external stores is estimated to be Mach 1.82 during supercruise and greater than Mach 2 with afterburners . The F-22 is among only a few aircraft that can supercruise , or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners ; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach . The Raptor 's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters . The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters due to a lack of aerodynamic drag from external stores . The F-22 's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight . Respectively , titanium alloys and composites comprise 39 % and 24 % of the aircraft 's structural weight . The F-22 is highly maneuverable at both supersonic and subsonic speeds . Computerized flight control system and full authority digital engine control ( FADEC ) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable . The Raptor 's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha ( angle of attack ) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver ( J-turn ) and Pugachev 's Cobra . The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60 \u00b0 alpha while having some roll control . The Raptor 's aerodynamic performance , sensor fusion , and stealth work together for increased effectiveness . Altitude , speed , and advanced active and passive sensors allow the aircraft to spot targets at considerable ranges and increase weapons range ; altitude and speed also complement stealth 's ability to increase the aircraft 's survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles . = = = Avionics = = = Key avionics include BAE Systems EI & S AN / ALR-94 radar warning receiver ( RWR ) , Lockheed Martin AN / AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector ( MLD ) and Northrop Grumman AN / APG-77 active electronically scanned array ( AESA ) radar . The MLD features six sensors to provide full spherical infrared coverage . The RWR is a passive radar detector with more than 30 antennas blended into the wings and fuselage for all-round coverage . Tom Burbage , former F-22 program head at Lockheed Martin , described it as \" the most technically complex piece of equipment on the aircraft . \" The range of the RWR ( 250 + nmi ) exceeds the radar 's , and can cue radar emissions to be confined to a narrow beam ( down to 2 \u00b0 by 2 \u00b0 in azimuth and elevation ) to increase stealth . Depending on the detected threat , the defensive systems can prompt the pilot to release countermeasures such as flares or chaff . According to Bill Sweetman , experts had said the ALR-94 can be used as a passive detection system capable of searching targets and providing enough information for a radar lock on . The AN / APG-77 radar features a low-observable , active-aperture , electronically scanned array that can track multiple targets under any weather conditions . Radar emissions can also be focused to overload enemy sensors as an electronic-attack capability . The radar changes frequencies more than 1,000 times per second to lower interception probability and has an estimated range of 125 \u2013 150 miles , though planned upgrades will allow a range of 250 miles ( 400 km ) or more in narrow beams . Radar information is processed by two Raytheon Common Integrated Processor ( CIP ) s , each capable of processing up to 10.5 billion instructions per second . In a process known as sensor fusion , data from the radar , other sensors , and external systems is filtered and combined by the CIP into a common view , reducing pilot workload . However , upgrading the aircraft 's avionics was reportedly very challenging due to their highly integrated nature . The F-22 's ability to operate close to the battlefield gives the aircraft threat detection and identification capability comparative with the RC-135 Rivet Joint , and the ability to function as a \" mini-AWACS \" , though the radar is less powerful than those of dedicated platforms . The F-22 can designate targets for allies , and determine whether two friendly aircraft are targeting the same aircraft . This radar system can sometimes identify targets \" many times quicker than the AWACS \" . The IEEE 1394B bus developed for the F-22 was derived from the commercial IEEE 1394 \" FireWire \" bus system . In 2007 , the F-22 's radar was tested as a wireless data transceiver , transmitting data at 548 megabits per second and receiving at gigabit speed , far faster than the Link 16 system . The F-22 's software has some 1.7 million lines of code , the majority involving processing radar data . Former Secretary of the USAF Michael Wynne blamed the use of the DoD 's Ada for cost overruns and delays on many military projects , including the F-22 . Cyberattacks on subcontractors have reportedly raised doubts about the security of the F-22 's systems and combat-effectiveness . In 2009 , former Navy Secretary John Lehman considered the F-22 to be safe from cyberattack , citing the age of its IBM software . = = = Cockpit = = = The F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments . The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument ; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) panels . The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles . The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input ( DVI ) controls , but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned . The canopy 's dimensions are approximately 140 inches long , 45 inches wide , and 27 inches tall ( 355 cm x 115 cm x 69 cm ) and weighs 360 pounds . The F-22 has integrated radio functionality , the signal processing systems are virtualized rather than as a separate hardware module . There have been several reports on the F-22 's inability to communicate with other aircraft , and funding cuts have affected the integration of the Multifunction Advanced Data Link ( MADL ) . Voice communication is possible , but not data transfer . The integrated control panel ( ICP ) is a keypad system for entering communications , navigation , and autopilot data . Two 3 in \u00d7 4 in ( 7.6 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm ) up-front displays located around the ICP are used to display integrated caution advisory / warning data , communications , navigation and identification ( CNI ) data and also serve as the stand-by flight instrumentation group and fuel quantity indicator . The stand-by flight group displays an artificial horizon , for basic instrument meteorological conditions . The 8 in \u00d7 8 in ( 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm ) primary multi-function display ( PMFD ) is located under the ICP , and is used for navigation and situation assessment . Three 6.25 in \u00d7 6.25 in ( 15.9 cm \u00d7 15.9 cm ) secondary multi-function displays are located around the PMFD for tactical information and stores management . The ejection seat is a version of the ACES II ( Advanced Concept Ejection Seat ) commonly used in USAF aircraft , with a center-mounted ejection control . The F-22 has a complex life support system , which includes the on-board oxygen generation system ( OBOGS ) , protective pilot garments , and a breathing regulator / anti-g ( BRAG ) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot 's mask and garments . The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit ( ATAGS ) project and are to protect against chemical / biological hazards and cold-water immersion , counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes , and provide thermal relief . Suspicions regarding the performance of the OBOGS and life support equipment have been raised by several mishaps , including a fatal crash . = = = Armament = = = The Raptor has three internal weapons bays : a large bay on the bottom of the fuselage , and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage , aft of the engine intakes . The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142 / A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141 / A launcher for short-range missiles . Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000 lb ( 450 kg ) or four 250 lb ( 110 kg ) bombs . Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft 's stealth and minimizes additional drag . Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second , during which hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft ; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight . The F-22 can also carry air-to-surface weapons such as bombs with Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) guidance and the Small-Diameter Bomb , but cannot self-designate for laser-guided weapons . Internal air-to-surface ordnance is limited to 2,000 lb . An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm cannon is embedded in the right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door to maintain stealth . The radar projection of the cannon fire 's path is displayed on the pilot 's head-up display . The F-22 's high cruise speed and altitude increase the effective ranges of its munitions , it has 50 % greater employment range for the AIM-120 AMRAAM than prior platforms , and range will be further extended with the introduction of the AIM-120D . While specifics are classified , it is expected that JDAMs employed by F-22s will have twice or more the effective range of legacy platforms . In testing , an F-22 dropped a GBU-32 JDAM from 50,000 feet ( 15,000 m ) while cruising at Mach 1.5 , striking a moving target 24 miles ( 39 km ) away . While the F-22 typically carries weapons internally , the wings include four hardpoints , each rated to handle 5,000 lb ( 2,300 kg ) . Each hardpoint can accommodate a pylon that can carry a detachable 600-gallon ( 2,270 L ) external fuel tank or a launcher holding two air-to-air missiles ; the two inboard hardpoints are \" plumbed \" for external fuel tanks . The use of external stores degrades the aircraft 's stealth and kinematic performance ; after releasing stores the external attachments can be jettisoned to restore those characteristics . A stealthy ordnance pod and pylon was being developed to carry additional weapons in the mid-2000s . = = = Stealth = = = The F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar . Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges , fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view , use of radar-absorbent material ( RAM ) , and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return . The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions , infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye . The aircraft 's flat thrust vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ( \" heat seeking \" ) surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles . Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight . Compared to previous stealth designs like the F-117 , the F-22 is less reliant on RAM , which are maintenance-intensive and susceptible to adverse weather conditions . Unlike the B-2 , which requires climate-controlled hangars , the F-22 can undergo repairs on the flight line or in a normal hangar . The F-22 features a Signature Assessment System which delivers warnings when the radar signature is degraded and necessitates repair . The F-22 's exact radar cross-section ( RCS ) is classified ; however , in 2009 Lockheed Martin released information indicating it has an RCS ( from certain angles ) of \u2212 40 dBsm \u2013 equivalent to the radar reflection of a \" steel marble \" . Effectively maintaining the stealth features can decrease the F-22 's mission capable rate to 62 \u2013 70 % . The effectiveness of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge . The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft 's frontal or side area from the perspective of a static radar . When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area , potentially increasing radar observability . Furthermore , the F-22 's stealth contouring and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars , usually found on other aircraft . The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size . However , such radars are also conspicuous , susceptible to clutter , and have low precision . Additionally , while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present , reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging . According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV , despite Iran 's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf . = = Operational history = = = = = Designation and testing = = = The YF-22 was originally given the unofficial name \" Lightning II \" , after the World War II Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter , which persisted until the mid-1990s when the USAF officially named the aircraft \" Raptor \" . The name \" Lightning II \" was later given to the F-35 . The aircraft was also briefly dubbed \" SuperStar \" and \" Rapier \" . In September 2002 , USAF changed the Raptor 's designation to F / A-22 , mimicking the Navy 's McDonnell Douglas F / A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft 's role and relevance . The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005 , when the aircraft entered service . Flight testing of the F-22 began in 1997 with Raptor 4001 , the first EMD jet , and eight more F-22s would participate in the EMD and flight test program . Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base ( AFB ) for survivability testing , including live fire testing and battle damage repair training . EMD F-22s have been used for testing upgrades , and also as maintenance trainers . The first production F-22 was delivered to Nellis AFB , Nevada , in January 2003 . In May 2006 , a released report documented a problem with the F-22 's forward titanium boom , caused by defective heat-treating . This made the boom on roughly the first 80 F-22s less ductile than specified and potentially shortened the part 's life . Modifications and inspections were implemented to the booms to restore life expectancy . In August 2008 , an unmodified F-22 of the 411th Flight Test Squadron performed in the first ever air-to-air refueling of an aircraft using synthetic jet fuel as part of a wider USAF effort to qualify aircraft to use the fuel , a 50 / 50 mix of JP-8 and a Fischer \u2013 Tropsch process-produced , natural gas-based fuel . In 2011 , an F-22 flew supersonic on a 50 % mixture of biofuel derived from camelina . = = = Introduction into service = = = In December 2005 , the USAF announced that the F-22 had achieved Initial Operational Capability ( IOC ) . During Exercise Northern Edge in Alaska in June 2006 , in simulated combat exercises 12 F-22s of the 94th FS downed 108 adversaries with no losses . In the exercises , the Raptor-led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air-to-air combat , with neither loss being an F-22 . During Red Flag 07-1 in February 2007 , 14 F-22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook close air support sorties . Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s , 6 \u2013 8 F-22s maintained air dominance throughout . No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures ; a single F-22 was judged lost against the defeated opposing force . F-22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance . The Raptor achieved Full Operational Capability ( FOC ) in December 2007 , when General John Corley of Air Combat Command ( ACC ) officially declared the F-22s of the integrated active duty 1st Fighter Wing and Virginia Air National Guard 192d Fighter Wing fully operational . This was followed by an Operational Readiness Inspection ( ORI ) of the integrated wing in April 2008 , in which it was rated \" excellent \" in all categories , with a simulated kill-ratio of 221 \u2013 0 . = = = Deployments = = = F-22 fighter units have been frequently deployed to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa , Japan . In February 2007 , on the aircraft 's first overseas deployment to Kadena Air Base , six F-22s of 27th Fighter Squadron flying from Hickam AFB , Hawaii , experienced multiple software-related system failures while crossing the International Date Line ( 180th meridian of longitude ) . The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following tanker aircraft . Within 48 hours , the error was resolved and the journey resumed . In early 2013 , F-22s were involved in U.S.-South Korean military drills . In November 2007 , F-22s of 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf AFB , Alaska , performed their first NORAD interception of two Russian Tu-95MS \" Bear-H \" bombers . Since then , F-22s have also escorted probing Tu-160 \" Blackjack \" bombers . The first pair of F-22s assigned to the 49th Fighter Wing became operational at Holloman AFB , New Mexico , in June 2008 . In 2014 , Holloman F-22s and their support personnel were reassigned to the reactivated 95th Fighter Squadron at Tyndall AFB . Secretary of Defense Gates initially refused to deploy F-22s to the Middle East in 2007 . The type made its first deployment in the region at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE in 2009 . In April 2012 , F-22s have been rotating into Al Dhafra Air Base , less than 200 miles from Iran ; the Iranian defense minister referred to the deployment as a security threat . In March 2013 the USAF announced that an F-22 had intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that approached within 16 miles of an MQ-1 Predator flying off the Iranian coastline . In June 2014 , F-22s from the 199th Fighter Squadron of the Hawaii Air National Guard were deployed to Malaysia to participate in the Cope Taufan 2014 exercise conducted by the USAF Pacific Air Forces and Royal Malaysian Air Force . On 22 September 2014 , F-22s performed the type 's first combat sorties during the American-led intervention in Syria ; a number of aircraft dropped 1,000-pound GPS-guided bombs on Islamic State targets in the vicinity of Tishrin Dam . Combat operations by F-22s are planned to continue into the foreseeable future . While some missions involve striking targets , the F-22 's main role is intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( ISR ) gathering . By January 2015 , the F-22 accounted for three percent of Air Force sorties during Operation Inherent Resolve . General Mike Hostage of ACC said that it performed \" flawlessly \" during this deployment . Between September 2014 and July 2015 , F-22s flew 204 sorties over Syria , dropping 270 bombs at some 60 locations . On 23 June 2015 , a pair of F-22s performed the aircraft 's first close air support ( CAS ) mission after receiving a short-notice request for airstrikes in close proximity to friendly forces . In late 2014 , the USAF was testing a rapid deployment concept involving four F-22s and one C-17 for support , first proposed in 2008 by two F-22 pilots . The goal was for the type to be able to set up and engage in combat within 24 hours . Four F-22s were deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany in August and Lask Air Base in Poland and Amari Air Base in Estonia in September 2015 to train with NATO allies . = = = Maintenance and training = = = F-22 aircraft were available for missions 62 % of the time on average in 2004 and 70 % in 2009 . The rate was at 63 % in 2015 . Early on , the F-22 required more than 30 hours of maintenance per flight hour and a total cost per flight hour of $ 44,000 ; by 2008 it was reduced to 18.1 , and 10.5 by 2009 ; lower than the Pentagon 's requirement of 12 maintenance hours per flight hour . When introduced , the F-22 had a Mean Time Between Maintenance ( MTBM ) of 1.7 hours , short of the required 3.0 ; in 2012 this rose to 3.2 hours . By 2013 , the cost per flight hour was $ 68,362 , over three times as much as the F-16 . In 2014 , the F-22 fleet required 43 maintenance man-hours per flight hour . Each aircraft requires a month-long packaged maintenance plan ( PMP ) every 300 flight hours . The stealth system , including its radar absorbing metallic skin , account for almost one third of maintenance . The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours . F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB , Utah . In January 2007 , the F-22 reportedly maintained 97 % sortie rate , flying 102 out of 105 tasked sorties while amassing a 144-to-zero kill ratio during \" Northern Edge \" air-to-air exercises in Alaska . According to Lieutenant Colonel Wade Tolliver , squadron commander of the 27th Fighter Squadron , the stealth coatings of the F-22 are more robust than those used in earlier stealth aircraft , being less sensitive to weather and wear and tear . However , rain caused \" shorts and failures in sophisticated electrical components \" when F-22s were posted to Guam . To reduce operating costs and lengthen the F-22 's service life , some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators , while the T-38 Talon is used for adversary training . DoD budget cuts led to F-22 demonstration flights being halted in 2013 before resuming in 2014 . In 2012 , it was reported that the F-22 's maintenance demands have increased as the fleet aged , the stealth coatings being particularly demanding . = = = = Operational problems = = = = Operational problems have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings . Critically , pilots have experienced a decreased mental status , including losing consciousness . There were reports of instances of pilots found to have a decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing . F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough ; other symptoms include irritability , emotional lability and neurological changes . A number of possible causes were investigated , including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing , pressure suit malfunction , side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations , and oxygen supply disruptions . Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures . The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight , but reports of oxygen issues persisted . In 2005 , the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group , a USAF expert panel , recommended several changes to deal with the oxygen supply issues . In October 2011 , Lockheed Martin was awarded a $ 24M contract to investigate the breathing difficulties . In July 2012 , the Pentagon concluded that a pressure valve on flight vests worn during high-altitude flights and a carbon air filter were likely sources of at least some hypoxia-like symptoms . Long-distance flights were resumed , but were limited to lower altitudes until corrections had been made . The carbon filters were changed to a different model to reduce lung exposure to carbon particulates . The breathing regulator / anti-g ( BRAG ) valve , used to inflate the pilot 's vest during high G maneuvers , was found to be defective , inflating the vest at unintended intervals and restricting the pilot 's breathing . The on-board oxygen generating system ( OBOGS ) also unexpectedly reduced oxygen levels during high-G maneuvers . In late 2012 , Lockheed Martin was awarded contracts to install a supplemental automatic oxygen backup system , in addition to the primary and manual backup . Changes recommended by the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group in 2005 received further consideration in 2012 ; the USAF reportedly considered installing EEG brain wave monitors on the pilot 's helmets for inflight monitoring . New backup oxygen generators and filters have been installed on the aircraft . The coughing symptoms have been attributed to acceleration atelectasis , which may be exacerbated by the F-22 's high performance ; there is no present solution to the condition . The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated . On 4 April 2013 , the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided . = = Variants = = YF-22A \u2013 pre-production technology demonstrator for ATF demonstration / validation phase ; two were built .

Former SoAF Donald Rice has called the possibility of the naval variant the deciding factor for his choice of the YF-22 over the YF-23 . = = = Derivatives = = = The FB-22 was a proposed medium-range bomber for the USAF . The FB-22 was projected to carry up to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to about twice the range of the F-22A , while maintaining the F-22 's stealth and supersonic speed . However , the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments , in lieu of a larger subsonic bomber with a much greater range . The X-44 MANTA , or multi-axis , no-tail aircraft , was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup . The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring , without featuring any rudders , ailerons , or elevators . Funding for this program was halted in 2000 . = = Operators = = United States United States Air Force The U.S. Air Force is the only operator of the F-22 .

The test pilot , Tom Morgenfeld , escaped without injury . The cause of the crash was found to be a flight control software error that failed to prevent a pilot-induced oscillation . The first F-22 crash occurred during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004 , in which the pilot ejected safely before impact . The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction ; consequently the aircraft design was corrected to avoid the problem . Following a brief grounding , F-22 operations resumed after a review . On 25 March 2009 , an EMD F-22 crashed 35 miles ( 56 km ) northeast of Edwards AFB during a test flight , resulting in the death of Lockheed Martin test pilot David P. Cooley . An Air Force Materiel Command investigation found that Cooley momentarily lost consciousness during a high-G maneuver , then ejected when he found himself too low to recover . Cooley was killed during ejection by blunt-force trauma from windblast due to the aircraft 's speed . The investigation found no design issues . On 16 November 2010 , an F-22 from Elmendorf AFB crashed , killing the pilot , Captain Jeffrey Haney . F-22s were restricted to flying below 25,000 feet , then grounded during the investigation . The crash was attributed to a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected , shutting down the Environmental Control System ( ECS ) and OBOGS . The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame , as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system . Haney 's widow sued Lockheed Martin , claiming equipment defects . She later reached a settlement . After the ruling , the engagement handle of the emergency oxygen system was redesigned ; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure . On 11 February 2013 , the DoD 's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney , and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions ; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling . During a training mission , an F-22 crashed to the east of Tyndall AFB , on 15 November 2012 . The pilot ejected safely and no injuries were reported on the ground . The investigation determined that a \" chafed \" electrical wire ignited the fluid in a hydraulic line , causing a fire that damaged the flight controls . = = Aircraft on display = = EMD F-22A 91-4003 is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force . = = Specifications ( F-22A ) = = Data from USAF , F-22 Raptor Team web site , manufacturers ' data , Aviation Week , and Journal of Electronic Defense , General characteristics Crew : 1 Length : 62 ft 1 in ( 18.92 m ) Wingspan : 44 ft 6 in ( 13.56 m ) Height : 16 ft 8 in ( 5.08 m ) Wing area : 840 ft \u00b2 ( 78.04 m \u00b2 ) Airfoil : NACA 64A ? 05.92 root , NACA 64A ? 04.29 tip Empty weight : 43,340 lb ( 19,700 kg ) Loaded weight : 64,840 lb ( 29,410 kg ) Max. takeoff weight : 83,500 lb ( 38,000 kg ) Powerplant : 2 \u00d7 Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 pitch thrust vectoring turbofans Dry thrust : 26,000 lb ( 116 kN ) each Thrust with afterburner : 35,000 + lb ( 156 + kN ) each Fuel capacity : 18,000 lb ( 8,200 kg ) internally , or 26,000 lb ( 12,000 kg ) with two external fuel tanks Performance Maximum speed : At altitude : Mach 2.25 ( 1,500 mph , 2,410 km / h ) [ estimated ] Supercruise : Mach 1.82 ( 1,220 mph , 1,960 km / h ) Range : > 1,600 nmi ( 1,840 mi , 2,960 km ) with 2 external fuel tanks Combat radius : 460 nmi ( with 100 nmi in supercruise clean ) ( 529 mi , 852 km ) Ferry range : 1,740 nmi ( 2,000 mi , 3,220 km ) Service ceiling : > 65,000 ft ( 20,000 m ) Wing loading : 77.2 lb / ft \u00b2 ( 377 kg / m \u00b2 ) Thrust / weight : 1.08 Maximum design g-load : + 9.0 / \u2212 3.0 g Armament Guns : 1 \u00d7 20 mm ( 0.787 in ) M61A2 Vulcan 6-barrel Gatling cannon in right wing root , 480 rounds Air to air mission loadout : 6 \u00d7 AIM-120 AMRAAM 2 \u00d7 AIM-9 Sidewinder Air to ground mission loadout : 2 \u00d7 1,000 lb ( 450 kg ) JDAM or 8 \u00d7 250 lb ( 110 kg ) GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs 2 \u00d7 AIM-120 AMRAAM 2 \u00d7 AIM-9 Sidewinder Hardpoints : 4 \u00d7 under-wing pylon stations can be fitted to carry 600 U.S. gallon drop tanks or weapons , each with a capacity of 5,000 lb ( 2,270 kg ) .

                    "text": "Douglas XCG-17 = The Douglas XCG-17 was an American assault glider , developed by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain twin-engine transport during World War II . Although the XCG-17 was successful in testing , the requirement for such a large glider had passed , and no further examples of the type were built ; one additional C-47 , however , was converted in the field to glider configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation , but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration . = = Design and development = = With the introduction of the Douglas C-54 Skymaster four-engined transport aircraft , the United States Army Air Forces , observing that conventional gliders then in service would be an inefficient use of the C-54 's power and capacity , determined that a requirement existed for a new , much larger assault glider . It was determined that the best solution to the requirement was the conversion of the Douglas C-47 Skytrain , already in large-scale production , to meet the requirement . The C-47 could be converted to a glider configuration with minimal alteration to the airframe , and would provide the required capacity . Trials conducted using a conventional , powered C-47 , first conducting ordinary deadstick landings , then being towed by another C-47 , indicated that the scheme was feasible . Therefore , a C-47-DL was taken in hand for conversion into a glider , which was given the designation XCG-17 . The aircraft , formerly a Northwest Airlines DC-3 that had been impressed into military service at the start of World War II , was modified by the removal of the aircraft 's engines ; the nacelles , containing the landing gear , remained in place , covered with aerodynamically profiled hemispherical domes for streamlining , containing fixed weight to compensate for the removal of the engines . Other equipment , no longer necessary with the conversion to an unpowered configuration , was also removed to save weight ; items removed included the aircraft 's wiring and bulkheads , along with the navigator 's and radio operator 's positions . = = Operational history = = The conversion , carried out at Clinton County Army Air Field , was completed on June 12 , 1944 , with the aircraft undergoing its initial flight test shortly thereafter . The flight testing of the XCG-17 proved that the aircraft was satisfactory ; compared with conventional gliders in service , the aircraft possessed lower stalling and higher towing speeds than conventional gliders , as well as gliding at a significantly shallower angle . Tow tests were conducted using a variety of aircraft ; the most commonly used configuration was a tandem tow by two C-47s , with the towing aircraft coupled in tandem and the leading aircraft detaching following takeoff . This configuration was dangerous for the \" middle \" C-47 , however , and it was determined that a single C-54 was the optimal tug aircraft . The XCG-17 's cargo hold had a capacity of 15,000 pounds ( 6,800 kg ) ; alternatively , up to 40 fully equipped troops could be transported , these figures being significantly larger than conventional gliders ' capacity . The XCG-17 was also capable of carrying three jeeps in a single load , or alternatively two 105-millimetre ( 4.1 in ) howitzers . Regardless of the aircraft 's load , no ballast was required to maintain the aircraft 's center of gravity , a trait unique among American assault gliders . Despite the satisfactory results in testing , however , the aircraft failed the Army 's requirement that it be capable of landing on unimproved fields ; in addition , by the time the evaluation of the XCG-17 was completed the need for such a large assault glider had passed . The primary role for the glider had been intended to increase the amount of supplies that could be carried to China over \" The Hump \" ; the war situation had , however , become more favorable and the added capacity an oversized glider would provide was no longer required . No further examples of the type were produced ; the prototype , its trials complete , was placed in storage , being ferried to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for disposal in August 1946 . In August 1949 , the aircraft was sold to Advance Industries , its engines being reinstalled to return the aircraft to powered status in DC-3C configuration . Some sources , however , indicate that the XCG-17 was reconverted to C-47 configuration in 1946 . Following its restoration to powered status , the aircraft was transferred to Mexico , where it remained in civilian service until 1980 . = = Field conversion = = Although the XCG-17 failed to lead to any production of a C-47 derived glider type , a single C-47 was converted in the field to glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command , located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines , during January 1946 . Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17 , the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings , with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed . Referred to as \" XCG-47 \" as well as \" XCG-17 \" , and named \" Nez Perce \" , the aircraft undertook its initial flight following conversion on June 17 , 1946 , towed by a C-54 . The flight tests of the field-converted aircraft proved favorable , and an ambitious flight , towing the aircraft from Luzon to Tokyo in Japan , was planned . This flight was intended to prove the suitability of large gliders to act as an \" aerial freight train \" for regular transport . The flight , conducted in late June 1946 , took 11 hours of flight time and included an overnight stay on Okinawa ; covering 1,800 miles ( 2,900 km ) , it concluded at Tachikawa Airfield near Tokyo . Despite the success of the flight , the \" aerial freight train \" concept did not catch on ; the aircraft had its engines re-fitted in August 1946 and was returned to service as a normal C-47 . = = Operators = = = = = Military ( as C-47 , then XCG-17 ) = = = United States United States Army Air Forces = = = Civilian ( as DC-3C ) = = = Mexico Petroleos Mexicanos = = Specifications ( 41-18496 ) = = Data from General characteristics Crew : Two ( Pilot and copilot ) Capacity : 15,000 pounds ( 6,800 kg ) cargo or 40 troops Length : 63 ft 9 in ( 19.43 m ) Wingspan : 95 ft 6 in ( 29.11 m ) Height : 17 ft ( 5.2 m ) Wing area : 987 sq ft ( 91.7 m2 ) Empty weight : 11,001 lb ( 4,990 kg ) Gross weight : 26,000 lb ( 11,793 kg ) Performance Maximum speed : 290 mph ( 467 km / h ; 252 kn ) max towing speed Cruising speed : 190 mph ; 165 kn ( 305 km / h ) gliding speed Stall speed : 35 mph ( 30 kn ; 56 km / h ) Maximum glide ratio : 14 : 1 Wing loading : 26.3 lb / sq ft ( 128 kg / m2 )",

                    "text": "Northrop F-20 Tigershark = The Northrop F-20 Tigershark ( initially F-5G ) was a privately financed light fighter , designed and built by Northrop . Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop 's F-5E Tiger II , featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance , and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar . Compared with the F-5E , the F-20 was much faster , gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability , and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons . With these improved capabilities , the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon , but was much less expensive to purchase and operate . Much of the F-20 's development was carried out under a US Department of Defense ( DoD ) project called \" FX \" . FX sought to develop fighters that would be capable in combat with the latest Soviet aircraft , but excluding sensitive front-line technologies used by the United States Air Force 's own aircraft . FX was a product of the Carter administration 's military export policies , which aimed to provide foreign nations with high quality equipment without the risk of US front-line technology falling into Soviet hands . Northrop had high hopes for the F-20 in the international market , but policy changes following Ronald Reagan 's election meant the F-20 had to compete for sales against aircraft like the F-16 , the USAF 's latest fighter design . The development program was abandoned in 1986 after three prototypes had been built and a fourth partially completed . = = Development = = = = = F-5E = = = When the Kennedy administration entered office in 1961 , the U.S. Department of Defense was instructed to find an inexpensive fighter aircraft that the United States could offer to its allies through the Mutual Defense Assistance Act . A number of designs were studied , including stripped-down versions of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Vought F-8 Crusader , and the newly designed Northrop N-156F . On 23 April 1962 , the United States Air Force ( USAF ) informed the United States Secretary of Defense that the N-156F had been selected , under the designation F-5 and given the name \" Freedom Fighter . \" 847 F-5 's of various early marks would be produced . As the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 became more common , the U.S. Air Force initiated the International Fighter Aircraft ( IFA ) program to provide an equivalent to allies . The USAF desired a light weight fighter with competitive performance to the MiG , inexpensive when purchased in large numbers , and with reasonable operating costs for prospective customer nations . Although numerous companies entered designs , Northrop 's existing F-5 put them in a leading position . They submitted an upgrade , the F-5E Tiger II , with the AN / APQ-153 radar and other changes to allow the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile to be fired from wing-tip rails . On 20 November 1970 , Northrop 's entry was announced as the IFA winner . Northrop produced a total of 1,399 F-5E / F Tiger IIs by the time manufacturing ended in 1986 . = = = F-5G and export limitations = = = In the late 1970s , the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) Air Force started looking for a fighter aircraft to match improvements made in mainland People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) ' s air force . In particular , they wanted a platform capable of firing the AIM-7 Sparrow long-range missile . At the time , the US was in the process of opening up ties with the People 's Republic of China after President Nixon 's famous visit in 1972 . China considered US support of Taiwan against their interests , and the US State Department wanted to tread carefully . They blocked export of all of the AIM-7 capable aircraft , even otherwise outdated early models of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II . The State Department suggested the Israeli IAI Kfir instead ; however , it was rejected . Taiwan was already producing the F-5E under license , so the Department of Defense asked Northrop to study adding an AIM-7 capable radar to the Tiger II as an alternative . This effort became the first of several F-5G studies . In the spring of 1977 , Jimmy Carter 's administration had announced a new military export policy that limited sales of front line designs to countries within NATO , along with Australia and Japan . Carter stated at the time that the U.S. could not be \" both the world 's champion of peace and the world 's leading supplier of the weapons of war . \" Previously , there was no coherent export policy , fueling concerns that the US 's latest technologies might quickly end up in Soviet hands . Numerous exceptions were made ; Israel and Egypt could buy advanced designs under the Camp David Agreements , Israel was even allowed to buy McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles , a key component in U.S. air-defense technology . Iran was already receiving the Grumman F-14 Tomcat , and this demonstrated the problem with advanced exports in February 1979 when reports emerged that Iran had sold an AIM-54 Phoenix missile to the Soviets . South Korea 's F-16 order was initially blocked under this policy , but later allowed in the context of strengthening relations . Despite exceptions , the export policy was implemented , covering many potential and current customers . As the F-5G was a relatively modest upgrade to the F-5E , the F-5G appeared to be in a strong position for sales given the limitations placed on rival designs , however Carter personally blocked the sales of the F-5G to Taiwan . = = = FX = = = In 1979 , problems with the export policy were becoming apparent . The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients , placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage . Denied by the U.S. , countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters , notably France 's Dassault Mirage 2000 . Barry N. Blechman , Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency , testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales . At the same time , there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan . The State Department argued that the U.S. needed a modern counterpart for the role the F-5E had occupied in the 1960s and 1970s . In light of Carter 's concerns , they suggested that a new aircraft be designed for the role , based on technology that would not pose a threat to the U.S. After a lengthy study , in January 1980 , President Carter allowed the development of a new export fighter : \" FX . \" The FX would have to outperform the F-5E ; however , it could not use any advanced avionics systems that were also used in US aircraft . Unlike the Mutual Defense Assistance Act programs that led to the F-5E , FX would be entirely privately financed . Moreover , the companies could not market the aircraft directly ; all sales would be handled by the Secretary of Defense . Both Northrop and General Dynamics ( GD ) responded to the FX requirement . GD 's F-16 / 79 was a variant of the F-16A , replacing the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine with the J79 and equipping it with downgraded avionics ; Northrop responded with the F-5G . = = = FX stumbles and F-20 emerges = = = When Ronald Reagan 's administration took power in 1981 , the export restrictions put in place by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed . At first , the FX program continued as normal , but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G 's potential sales . The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqu\u00e9 was a major agreement on arms sales , which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan . By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project , the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo . In signing the Communiqu\u00e9 , the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft , therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan 's primary focus . As a result , the F-5G 's sales potential remained unestablished . In the summer of 1982 , Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci sent a memorandum to the Air Force and Navy , encouraging them to seek out potential foreign customers to procure FX aircraft . However , four months later Carlucci sent a classified memo to the same services to abandon the FX , and green-lighting the exporting of front-line fighters overseas . In December , after prompting from the White House , Carlucci reversed his position again , and directed the Air Force to fund a small number of F-20s in the fiscal year 1984 budget . The future of the FX program seemed doubtful . Following an agreement to sell F-16s to Pakistan , Northrop felt that the F-5G needed to match the performance of F-16 . This would require not only better performance from the engine , but a new and comparable avionics suite as well . Northrop saw that the F-5G was still being viewed as the \" FX fighter \" , a low-cost option for second-tier air forces . To combat this perception , Northrop requested the designation \" F-20 \" ; the USAF approved in late 1982 , and of the name Tigershark in March 1983 . = = Design = = The primary design change between the earlier F-5E and the F-5G was the use of a single General Electric F404 engine that was originally designed for the F / A-18 Hornet . The new engine provided 60 % more thrust compared to the combined output of the F-5E 's paired General Electric J85s . This improved the aircraft 's thrust-to-weight ratio to 1.13 from 1.0 . The new engine gave speed of over Mach 2.0 , a ceiling over 55,000 ft ( 16,800 m ) , an initial climb rate of 52,800 ft per minute ( 16,100m / min ) . The wing profile remained the same as the F-5E , but had modified leading edge extensions ( LEX ) , which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12 % with an increase in wing area of only 1.6 % . The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch , so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30 % and a new dual-channel fly-by-wire control system was added . Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7 % to 20 \u00b0 / sec . Sustained turn rate at Mach 0.8 and 15,000 ft ( 4,572 m ) rose to 11.5 \u00b0 / sec , which compared well with the F-16 's 12.8 \u00b0 / sec . Supersonic turn rates were 47 % higher than those of the F-5E . The F-20 would also make greater usage of composite materials in its construction . During its development , several areas using metal were re-designed to use fiberglass , and there were numerous upgrades to various mechanical parts . The F-20 's avionics suite was all-new and greatly improved over the earlier designs . The General Electric AN / APG-67 multi-mode radar was the heart of the sensor suite , offering a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes . The F-5 's electro-mechanical navigation system was replaced with an all-electronic version based on a ring laser gyroscope . Time from power-on to being able to launch was greatly reduced as a result , to about 22 seconds , and Northrop boasted the aircraft had the shortest scramble time of any contemporary aircraft . The cockpit of the F-5 was completely re-worked with a large heads-up display ( HUD ) and two monochrome multi-function displays set high on the control panel , and the addition of a complete hands-on-throttle-and-stick ( HOTAS ) control system . Many of the avionics promised to have reliability beyond that of any competing aircraft then in service . The F-20 would have been able to utilize most of the common weapons in U.S. ' s inventory , including the entire range of Mark 80 series bombs , the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile , and the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles . Like the earlier F-5s , the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted in the nose . Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s ; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39 , it was lighter and had a higher rate of fire than the M39A2 . The F-20 did , however , have several problems inherent to its small size . The low-mounted wing meant that there was limited ground clearance , and the position of the landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings . This limited hard point weights to 1,000 lb ( 454 kg ) . A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more , a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb or up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs . Additionally , although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack ( AoA ) while maneuvering , it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA . This did not present a problem in the fighter role , but did severely reduce its payload / range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16 . Offered as a low-cost option , the F-20 was significantly more expensive than the F-5E , but much less expensive than other designs like the $ 30 million F-15 Eagle , or $ 15 million F-16 Fighting Falcon . The F-20 was projected to consume 53 % less fuel , require 52 % less maintenance manpower , had 63 % lower operating and maintenance costs and had four times the reliability of average front-line designs of the era . The F-20 also offer the ability to fire the beyond-visual-range AIM-7 Sparrow missile , a capability that the F-16 lacked at that time , and did not gain until the Block 15 ADF version in February 1989 . = = Operational history = = = = = Testing = = = On 30 August 1982 , the original engine-change-only F-5G ( serial 82-0062 , c / n GG1001 , registered N4416T ) made its maiden flight piloted by Russ Scott . During the 40-minute flight , the prototype climbed to 40,000 ft ( 12,000 m ) and reached Mach 1.04 . GG1001 demonstrated outstanding reliability ; by the end of April 1983 240 flights had been accumulated , including evaluation flights with 10 potential customer nations . The second prototype ( serial number 82-0063 , registered N3986B , c / n GI1001 ) , featuring the complete avionics suite , made its first flight on 26 August 1983 . The F-20 would fly a total of 1,500 flights prior to its termination ; although these were exclusively flown in ideal conditions . Note : \" ... Northrup did not take a prototype approach with the F-20 ... The First F-20 was intended to be a production quality aircraft ... \" page 5 Rand Corporation report A Case Study of the F-20 Tigershark June 1987 . During the test program , the F-20 fired the AIM-9 Sidewinder and , in February 1985 the AIM-7 Sparrow . In air-to-ground testing , it fired the AGM-65 Maverick , 2.75 in ( 70 mm ) folding fin aerial rockets , dropped Mk . 82 bombs , and fired rounds from a 30 mm ( 1.18 in ) gun pod ( GPU-5 / A , four-barrel GAU-13 / A ) in addition to the two internal 20 mm ( .79 in ) M39 cannon . One of the F-20 's flight characteristics was the ability to fly at only 124 km / h ( 77 mph ) at 35 \u00b0 AoA ( angle of attack ) , while the F-16 was limited to 30 \u00b0 ; acceleration from Mach 0.9 to 1.2 in 29 seconds ( at 9,150 m ) ; climb to 12,200 m ( or 40,000 ft ) in 2.3 minutes ( including 55 sec for the start and 22 for the INS set-up ) . Northrop signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Air Force in May 1983 that made the Air Force responsible for certifying the F-20 's performance , air worthiness and fixed-price program . Aerospace legend Chuck Yeager , employed as a spokesperson for Northrop , touted the aircraft as \" magnificent \" and was featured in advertising . In November 1982 , Bahrain became the first customer . South Korea also explored local production of the F-20 , and in support improvements were implemented . These included avionics upgrades , an expanded fuel tank , and the use of fibreglass composites . The changes were so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to test them . By 1983 , Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20 , and its prospects appeared positive . On 10 October 1984 , GG1001 crashed in South Korea on a demonstration flight , killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell . An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults ; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces . GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay , Labrador , killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes . Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC ; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show . = = = Battle for sales = = = In December 1981 , President Reagan , reacting to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , signed a major economic and military aid package for Pakistan that included 40 F-16As . The offer was in keeping with U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union , and the idea of \" containment \" within a ring of U.S.-friendly countries . The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was initially viewed as an attempt to break out of the arranged containment system , thus the U.S. placed a priority on quickly building up a new layer of defense . However , other U.S. allies saw this as a potential break in the FX policy , and began requesting only \" the very best . \" Such approval was increasingly granted starting in 1982 . In May , Venezuela , who had long examined the FX project , agreed to buy 18 F-16As and six F-16Bs , replacing a fleet of Mirage III interceptors and Mirage 5 ground-attack aircraft . Sweden decided to develop their own design , the JAS 39 Gripen . In September 1983 , Turkey announced plans to buy 132 F-16Cs and 28 F-16Ds to replace their Lockheed F-104G / S Starfighter and Northrop F-5A / B. Greece , stung by its long-time rival receiving the F-16 , purchased 34 F-16C and six F-16Ds in November 1984 , giving a firm pledge of secrecy . Then , late in 1983 , the U.S. government made a financial commitment to help Israel develop its own new fighter , the IAI Lavi . Northrop objected to this , as the Lavi would be a potential competitor to the F-20 in the export market ; while Northrop had to privately fund the F-5G , the government was directly subsidizing a foreign competitor . Congressional support for Israel overruled Northrop 's complaints along with complaints from other branches of the government . While other companies marketed directly to foreign air forces , as part of the FX program , the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department . Under this policy umbrella , Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review , which could take months . The State Department had no interest in selling the FX , from their perspective it was one aircraft among many , leading to a lackadaisical approach , and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough . = = = Congressional investigation and Air Force collusion = = = Starting in March 1984 , Congress chaired a series of hearings into FX . William Schneider , Jr . , the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance , Science and Technology , testified that FX policy might not result in any sales , in spite of any government support . He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy , secondarily a commercial venture . Thomas V. Jones , Northrop 's CEO , argued that there was little point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them . He suggested the FX concept be dropped , and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor . Additionally , Brigadier General Thomas Baker , USAF Director of International Programs , testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX . He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries , none were FX . He also compared France 's aircraft exports , showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed . In the Committee 's concluding remarks , the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric , and lacking support , on FX . In April 1984 , after the Congressional hearings , the USAF was directed to promote FX actively . Several potential customers were briefed during May and June 1984 on the performance and cost of both the F-20 and F-16 / 79 . The Air Force published an internal report on FX in late June 1984 . The F-20 was characterized as having outstanding performance against viable threats ; and seen as a candidate for the Air Force 's aggressor requirement . The report additionally stated that the F-20 had been contractor-funded , totaling over $ 750 million , compared to $ 60 million on the F-16 / 79 . However , the report concluded that it had little or no market to sell to . The USAF had a vested interest to encourage F-16 sales ; larger production numbers would drive down the cost per unit . Gregg Easterbrook noted that F-20 may have cast the Air Force in a bad light , as an aircraft developed independent of their input , authors such as Donald Pattillo shared this conclusion . In contrast , the F-16 was heavily involved in the USAF hierarchy , originating from a group of officers known as the \" fighter mafia \" . By March 1985 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of State were reconsidering the policy . Despite some calls to support Northrop , FX was abandoned . = = = Aggressor and ANG roles = = = A possibility for a U.S. purchase opened in 1984 , for a small number of \" aggressor aircraft \" for dissimilar air combat training . This style of training had been introduced by the United States Navy at their TOPGUN school , using the F-5 to simulate the MiG-21 . In November 1984 , Congress directed the Navy and Air Force to study the use of a single aircraft type to fill similar aggressor roles for both services . In January 1985 the Navy announced they had selected a specially configured version of the F-16 . It was rumored that the aircraft was sold at a loss to keep Northrop 's F-20 out of the market . Another chance for the F-20 was as an upgrade for the Air National Guard ( ANG ) . Northrop claimed that the F-20 's fast scramble time made it a natural fit for this role , its lower cost would allow the ANG to operate larger aircraft numbers , and that it supported the AIM-7 while the F-16 did not . Additionally , the ANG would not be competing with the Air Force for production quotas , they would be able to replace their aircraft more quickly . However , the Air Force 's requirements had priorities favoring the F-16 for the role ; if the ANG flew the F-16 , they would further lower unit costs , maintain commonality between the ANG and USAF , and better equip ANG units to perform front line combat roles . The Congressional Budget Office had also disputed Northrop 's lower cost claim in their own research . On 31 October 1986 , the Air Force announced that the F-16C had been selected , which had been upgraded to support the AIM-7 . As several nations had suggested they would accept the F-20 on the condition that it was inducted into the USAF , the selection was a heavy blow to Northrop . = = = Cancellation = = = After six years with no buyers , in late 1986 Northrop cancelled the $ 1.2 billion project . Northrop was reluctant to protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in fear of losing support for the project for the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled ; along with the small order by Bahrain . Later on , a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea , leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones , who retired in 1989 . In the late 1980s , local production of the F-20 was discussed with India . A move was also made in the 1980s to market the aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force with a license production manufacture of the aircraft . It was evaluated by a Pakistani contingent in the United States , with the F-20 being flown by Abbas Mirza , a senior Pakistani air force fighter pilot . Of the components of the F-20 , the radar would end up being the most successful ; Taiwan selected it for the Ching-kuo , South Korea also adopted it for the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle trainer aircraft , and the radar was used in the multinational FMA IA 63 Pampa . As sales prospects were not apparent early on , GE sold their radar division , which was eventually acquired by Lockheed-Martin . Aviation author Steve Pace wrote of the F-20 as \" one of the best fighters that never went into production . \" While discussing military procurement , Thomas McNaugher stated that competition between the F-20 and the F-16 served to lower prices and generate \" massive savings \" for the U.S. government . Writing prior to cancellation , Ralph Nader and William Taylor noted that the F-20 had been commonly described as \" the first privately funded U.S. combat aircraft in recent history . \" Mazher A. Hameed commented in 1986 that the F-20 was a \" logical choice \" for the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia ; however , it had \" scant chance of being selected \" due to political factors , as well as competition from other candidates such as the Mirage 2000 and Panavia Tornado ADV . = = Aircraft disposition = = 82-0062 ( Northrop serial number GG.1001 ) - crashed at Suwon Air Base , South Korea on 10 October 1984 .

Capable of being armed with bombs or torpedoes , 2000 aircraft were ordered , but only around 200 were built . The type saw some service in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese , but continuing developmental issues affecting the aircraft , along with the success of operations using more conventional weapons , led to the decision being made to cancel the assault drone program in October 1944 . = = Design and development = = In 1936 , Lieutenant Commander Delmar S. Fahrney proposed that unpiloted , remotely controlled aircraft had potential for use by the United States Navy in combat operations . Due to the limitations of the technology of the time , development of the \" assault drone \" project was given a low priority , but by the early 1940s the development of the radar altimeter and television made the project more feasible , and following trials using converted manned aircraft , the first operational test of a drone against a naval target was conducted in April 1942 . That same month , following trials of the Naval Aircraft Factory TDN assault drone , Interstate Aircraft received a contract from the Navy for two prototype and 100 production aircraft to a simplified and improved design , to be designated TDR-1 . Control of the TDR-1 would be conducted from either a control aircraft , usually a Grumman TBF Avenger , with the operator viewing a tv screen showing the view from a camera mounted aboard the drone along with the radar altimeter 's readout , or via a pilot on board the TDR-1 for test flights . Powered by two Lycoming O-435 engines of 220 horsepower ( 160 kW ) each , the TDR-1 used a remarkably simple design , with a steel-tube frame constructed by the Schwinn bicycle company covered with a molded wood skin , thus making little use of strategic materials so as not to impede production of higher priority aircraft . Capable of being optionally piloted for test flights , an aerodynamic fairing was used to cover the cockpit area during operational missions . The TDR-1 was equipped with a fixed tricycle landing gear , that on operations would be jettisoned following takeoff for improved performance . = = Operational history = = Under the code-name Operation Option , the Navy projected that up to 18 squadrons of assault drones would be formed , with 162 Grumman TBF Avenger control aircraft and 1000 assault drones being ordered . However technical difficulties in the development of the TDR-1 , combined with a continued low priority given to the project , saw the contract modified with the order reduced to only around 300 aircraft . A single TDR-1 was tested by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the XBQ-4 , however no production contract resulted from this testing . In 1944 , under the control of the Special Air Task Force ( SATFOR ) , the TDR-1 was deployed operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese . TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron ( Special Air Task Group 1 ) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft , and the first operational mission took place on September 27 , conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships . Despite this success , the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft , due to a combination of continued technical problems , the aircraft failing to live up to expectations , and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan . The final mission was flown on October 27 , with 50 drones having been expended on operations , 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets , without loss to the pilots of STAG-1 .

                    "text": "Platt-LePage XR-1 = The Platt-LePage XR-1 , also known by the company designation PL-3 , was an early American twin-rotor helicopter , built by the Platt-LePage Aircraft Company of Eddystone , Pennsylvania . The winner of a United States Army Air Corps design competition held in early 1940 , the XR-1 was the first helicopter tested by the USAAF , flying in 1941 . The flight testing of the XR-1 proved troublesome , and although continued testing showed that the design had promise , other , improved helicopters were becoming available before the XR-1 was ready for service . As a result , the development of the aircraft was terminated in 1945 . = = Design and development = = Developed during 1939 from an earlier , unsuccessful design , the PL-1 , the Platt-LePage Model PL-3 was the winner of a 1940 design competition , held under the terms of the Dorsey-Logan Act , for the supply of a helicopter design to the United States Army Air Corps . Platt-LePage 's submission was judged by the Army to be superior to its competitors , which included a helicopter submitted by Vought-Sikorsky , and autogyros developed by Kellett and Pitcairn . Following the selection of the Platt-LePage design in May 1940 , a contract for the construction of a prototype and a static test airframe was issued in July of that year . The contract specified delivery of the flying prototype in January 1941 , however the aircraft was not completed until three months later than the contract schedule , a delay that led to Sikorsky receiving Dorsey-Logan Act funding for development of its design , which became the XR-4 . In its design , the XR-1 bore a strong resemblance to the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 , a helicopter developed by Henrich Focke in Germany that , flown by Hanna Reitsch , had impressed Platt-LePage co-founder Wynn LePage during a tour of Europe . The XR-1 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine , mounted in a buried installation within the fuselage . The aircraft had two , three-bladed rotors , mounted in a side-by-side arrangement on wing-like pylons . The pylons were aerodynamically designed to produce some lift when in forwards flight , slightly unloading the rotors . The construction of the XR-1 was conventional by the standards of the time , with the aircraft 's frame consisting of a steel-tube framework , which was covered with fabric . The XR-1 had tail surfaces similar to those of a conventional aircraft , and was equipped with a fixed , taildragger landing gear . The aircraft 's wheels freely castered for easier maneuvering on the ground . The cockpit of the XR-1 seated the aircraft 's two crew members in a tandem arrangement , the pilot located ahead of the observer , and was extensively glazed to provide good visibility in the aircraft 's intended observation and army co-operation role . During the development of the aircraft , Major General Robert M. Danford proposed to the War Department that the XR-1 be evaluated against the Stinson YO-54 and the Kellett YG-1B autogyro . = = Operational history = = Following several months of ground testing , the XR-1 conducted its maiden flight on May 12 , 1941 , although the aircraft was restrained by a tether for its early flights . On June 23 the aircraft conducted its first free flight , albeit remaining within a few feet of the ground . As flight testing continued and the aircraft 's performance envelope was expanded , the XR-1 's quickly proved troublesome , the testing showing a variety of troubles with the design . These included issues with the aircraft 's controls , insufficient control authority being present , and in addition there were resonance issues with the airframe that made the XR-1 prone to pilot-induced oscillations . The aircraft was modified in an attempt to resolve these issues , and the Army modified Platt-LePage 's contract to provide additional funding for improvements to the design , but despite this the XR-1 's problems continued . In addition , the company 's test pilot , Lou Leavitt , lacked confidence in the design , refusing to fly the aircraft to its full potential . The situation was only resolved when Colonel H. Franklin Gregory , director of rotor-wing projects for the Army Air Forces , flew the aircraft himself , reaching 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) on his first flight in the aircraft . With the worst of the aircraft 's problems believed to have been resolved , the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943 . During the course of the Army 's evaluations , the XR-1 's empennage failed during structural testing , the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing , following the repairs , resuming in 1944 . Despite the modifications to the design , however , the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority . In July 1943 , the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed , seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray , who had replaced Leavitt following the latter 's dismissal from the company . The crash was caused by an inspector 's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft , the rotor hub failing in flight as a result of the decision . The aircraft was repairable , but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again . Testing was , however , able to continue in the meantime , as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 contract to cover a second flight-test aircraft . Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1 's design and designated XR-1A , the second aircraft had flown for the first time in May 1943 . The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1 , with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility , and the pilot and observer 's positions being reversed , the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit . During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in flight performance to the XR-1 ; however , the controls were still proving troublesome , although the worst of the bugs did seem to have been worked out . Following a cross-country flight to Wright Field in Ohio from Platt-LePage 's Pennsylvania plant , testing of the XR-1A continued until a mechanical failure in the rotor hub led to a crash landing on 26 October 1944 , the company deciding to sell the wreckage for scrap . The XR-1 , having been repaired in the meantime , was once again flying , and a contract had been awarded to Platt-Lepage for the construction of seven pre-production aircraft , to be built to an improved version of the XR-1A design , and designated YR-1A . Motivated by Congressional concerns about potential favouritism towards Sikorsky Aircraft , which had in the meantime been given a contract for development of an improved version of their VS-300 experimental helicopter , the contract called for delivery of the first YR-1A to the Army in January 1945 . However , due to continued financial and flight-testing problems , Platt-Lepage proved incapable of meeting this schedule . Although the XR-1 's problems seemed to be approaching resolution by late 1944 , the protracted development of the aircraft meant that alternative , improved helicopters , such as Sikorsky 's XR-4 , less expensive and more maneuverable than Platt-LePage 's aircraft , were becoming available . In addition , even the XR-1A 's improvements had failed to cure the aircraft of all of its control and vibration problems , and the AAF 's Air Material Command considered the company \" inept \" in its work , applying a \" hit-or-miss method \" to research and development . As a result of this assessment , the Army 's contracts with the company were universally cancelled in early April 1945 . Following the cancellation of the Army 's contract , the XR-1 was returned to the company , Platt-LePage believing that the design had potential as a civilian aircraft . The planned civilian version , the PL-9 , would have been an enlarged , twin-engined aircraft ; however Platt-LePage was by now in serious financial difficulty following the cancellation of its Army contract , and in mid 1946 the XR-1 's flight test program was concluded , the aircraft being retired to the Smithsonian Institution . In the meantime , the company 's former test pilot , Lou Leavitt , had purchased the wreckage of the XR-1A at a price of 4 cents per pound . Leavitt had formed a new company , Helicopter Air Transport , intending to provide helicopter flight training in anticipation of a postwar aviation boom , and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition . The projected boom failed to materialise , however , and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy , Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki , another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company . Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns , and used the airframe in the development of the PA-2B , a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage . = = Survivors = = Following the conclusion of flight testing , the XR-1 was returned to the Army Air Forces , who placed the aircraft in storage before donating it to the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum .

                    "text": "Lavochkin La-150 = The Lavochkin La-150 ( also known as the Izdeliye 150 \u2013 Aircraft or Article 150 , USAF / DOD designation Type 3 ) , was designed by the Lavochkin design bureau ( OKB ) in response to a 1945 order to build a single-seat jet fighter using a single German turbojet . By this time both the Americans and British , as well as the Germans , had already flown jet fighters and the single Soviet jet engine under development ( the Lyulka TR-1 ) was not yet ready for production . The design was completed quickly , but the construction of the five flying prototypes was protracted by the factory 's inexperience in building metal aircraft . The aircraft made its first flight in September 1946 , but proved to require extensive modifications to meet the Soviet Air Forces ' requirements . These took so long to make and test that the aircraft was essentially obsolete by the time that they were completed . Even one variant with a much more powerful engine was inferior to other aircraft that the OKB had under development and all work was terminated in 1947 . = = Design and development = = The Lavochkin OKB was ordered to design a fighter using a single Junkers Jumo 004B axial-flow turbojet in February 1945 . Much like their rivals at the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB with their MiG-9 , the OKB chose a \" pod-and-boom \" layout for their new fighter , based on advice from the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute ( TsAGI ) , although their design had a shoulder-mounted wing . The wings of the all-metal aircraft had fixed leading edges and slotted flaps . The cockpit was well forward , giving the pilot good visibility , and he was protected by an armored headrest . The windscreen of the teardrop-shaped canopy was also armored . Two 23-millimetre ( 0.91 in ) Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon were mounted on the lower side of the fuselage with 75 rounds per gun . The tricycle landing gear retracted into the fuselage which gave the 150 a very narrow track . The Soviet derivative of the Jumo engine , the RD-10 , was rated at 900 kilograms-force ( 8.8 kN ; 2,000 lbf ) and was mounted behind the cockpit . A steel heat shield protected the bottom of the rear fuselage from the engine 's exhaust . Air was supplied by an intake in the aircraft nose that split around the cockpit before reaching the engine . Seven tanks , five in the fuselage and one in each wing , carried a total of 500 kilograms ( 1,100 lb ) of fuel . Construction of a full-scale mockup was completed in June 1945 by Factory No. 81 , but the order for five prototypes was given to Factory No. 381 as Factory No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs . Manufacturing drawings were delivered to Factory No. 381 by the end of August , but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling . By the end of the year , the factory had only managed to complete a single airframe for static load testing . This showed that the rear fuselage , wings and tail needed to be reinforced , and the opportunity was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well . These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946 . Manufacturer 's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August , after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice , and the first flight was made on 11 September . The following day , the Council of Ministers ordered that a small batch of jets from each OKB were to participate in the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution . Because of the tight deadline , the components for the two incomplete prototypes were turned over to Factory No. 301 at Khimki , the new headquarters for the Lavochkin OKB , for assembly by Factory No. 381 . Factory No. 21 in Gorky joined the program with three more aircraft built in record time with support from Factory No. 301 . Tooling was constructed in 5 \u2013 10 days with the first aircraft completed in a week and a half . = = = Testing and evaluation = = = All eight aircraft were complete by 1 November and had been tested to ensure their readiness to participate in the parade . They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13 . It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either . Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow , but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather . The tests conducted in preparation for the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability , a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation , poor access to the engine , inadequate fuel capacity , compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge , and poor elevator control forces . Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory 's testing in late 1946 . The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak . Engine problems , however , plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes . After the conclusion of the manufacturer 's trials in April 1947 , one aircraft was returned to the factory for extensive modifications as the 150M . The wing tips were angled downward 35 \u00b0 to reduce the lateral stability , the wing was redesigned to detach from the fuselage , and the aerodynamic balancing of the elevators was reduced from 24 % to 20 % . The fuel capacity was increased to 660 kilograms ( 1,460 lb ) , the cockpit was widened by 80 centimeters ( 31 in ) and fitted with an ejection seat . Fore and aft armor plates were fitted to protect the pilot and a new radio aerial mast was installed . All these changes added 365 kilograms ( 805 lb ) of weight and increased drag which reduced the aircraft 's top speed by 73 to 805 km / h ( 45 to 500 mph ) , and slowed its time to 5,000 meters ( 16,400 ft ) from 4.8 to 7.2 minutes in comparison to the unmodified aircraft . Given that a higher-performance design , the Aircraft 156 , had already been submitted for state acceptance trials , Semyon Lavochkin decided not to continue the development of the 150M . In the meantime , the OKB had been developing two afterburning versions of the RD-10 in an effort to increase the engine 's power . The more successful model was only 100 millimeters ( 3.9 in ) longer and weighed an additional 31 kilograms ( 68 lb ) more than the original engine . Its power , however , was increased by an additional 340 kilograms-force ( 3.3 kN ; 750 lbf ) , over 30 % more thrust . This engine was designated the izdeliye YuF by the bureau and was fitted into an aircraft 150 prototype in July 1947 , designated as the 150F . The additional power increased the aircraft 's top speed to 950 km / h ( 590 mph ) at sea level and 915 km / h ( 569 mph ) at an altitude of 4,320 meters ( 14,170 ft ) . This made the 150F the second-fastest Soviet fighter of the period , after the MiG-9 powered by two afterburning RD-21 engines . Nevertheless , Lavochkin decided not to submit the 150F for state acceptance trials as the fundamental design flaws of the airframe still had not been resolved . = = Operators = = Soviet Union Soviet Air Force = = Variants = = 150M \u2013 One 150 prototype was modified with drooped wingtips , a wider cockpit and extra fuel . 150F \u2013 One 150 prototype was modified with a Izdeliye YuF engine , an afterburning RD-10 . = = Specifications ( Aircraft 150 ) = = Data from Early Soviet Jet Fighters General characteristics Crew : 1 , pilot Length : 9.42 m ( 30 ft 11 in ) Wingspan : 8.20 m ( 26 ft 10.83 in ) Height : 2.6 m ( 8 ft 6.36 in ) Wing area : 12.15 m \u00b2 ( 130.64 ft \u00b2 ) Empty weight : 2,156 kg ( 4,753 lb ) Loaded weight : 2,973 kg ( 6,554 lb ) Powerplant : 1 \u00d7 RD-10 turbojet , 8.8 kN ( 1,984 lbf ) Performance Maximum speed : 546 mph ( 878 km / h ) Range : 306 mi ( 493 km ) Service ceiling : 12,600m ( 41,338ft ) Rate of climb : 22.1 m ( 4,349 ft ) Wing loading : 244.6 kg / m \u00b2 ( 50.22 lb / ft \u00b2 ) Thrust / weight : 0.303 Armament 2 \u00d7 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon with 75 rpg",

                    "text": "Supermarine Spitfire = The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was used by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries before , during and after the Second World War . The Spitfire was built in many variants , using several wing configurations , and was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft . It was also the only British fighter to be in continuous production throughout the war . The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts , with approximately 54 Spitfires being airworthy , while many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world . The Spitfire was designed as a short-range , high-performance interceptor aircraft by R. J. Mitchell , chief designer at Supermarine Aviation Works , which operated as a subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrong from 1928 . In accordance with its role as an interceptor , Mitchell supported the development of the Spitfire 's distinctive elliptical wing ( designed by B. Shenstone ) to have the thinnest possible cross-section ; this enabled the Spitfire to have a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters , including the Hawker Hurricane . Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937 , whereupon his colleague Joseph Smith took over as chief designer , overseeing the development of the Spitfire through its multitude of variants . During the Battle of Britain , from July to October 1940 , the Spitfire was perceived by the public to be the RAF fighter , though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against the Nazi German air force , the Luftwaffe . Spitfire units , however , had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance . Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging the Luftwaffe fighters ( mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for the Spitfire ) during the Battle . After the Battle of Britain , the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of RAF Fighter Command , and saw action in the European , Mediterranean , Pacific and the South-East Asian theatres . Much loved by its pilots , the Spitfire served in several roles , including interceptor , photo-reconnaissance , fighter-bomber and trainer , and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s . The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s . Although the original airframe was designed to be powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030 hp ( 768 kW ) , it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and , in later marks , Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340 hp ( 1,745 kW ) ; as a consequence of this the Spitfire 's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its life . = = Development and production = = = = = Origins = = = R. J. Mitchell 's 1931 design to meet Air Ministry specification F7 / 30 for a new and modern fighter capable of 250 mph ( 400 km / h ) , the Supermarine Type 224 , was an open-cockpit monoplane with bulky gull-wings and a large fixed , spatted undercarriage powered by the 600 horsepower ( 450 kW ) evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine . This made its first flight in February 1934 . Of the seven designs tendered to F7 / 30 , the Gloster Gladiator biplane was accepted for service . The Type 224 was a big disappointment to Mitchell and his design team , who immediately embarked on a series of \" cleaned-up \" designs , using their experience with the Schneider Trophy seaplanes as a starting point . This led to the Type 300 , with retractable undercarriage and the wingspan reduced by 6 ft ( 1.8 m ) . This was submitted to the Air Ministry in July 1934 , but was not accepted . The design then went through a series of changes , including the incorporation of a faired , enclosed cockpit , oxygen-breathing apparatus , smaller and thinner wings , and the newly developed , more powerful Rolls-Royce PV-XII V-12 engine , later named the \" Merlin \" . In November 1934 Mitchell , with the backing of Supermarine 's owner , Vickers-Armstrong , started detailed design work on this refined version of the Type 300 On 1 December 1934 , the Air Ministry issued contract AM 361140 / 34 , providing \u00a3 10,000 for the construction of Mitchell 's improved F7 / 30 design . On 3 January 1935 , they formalised the contract with a new specification , F10 / 35 , written around the aircraft . In April 1935 , the armament was changed from two .303 in ( 7.7 mm ) Vickers machine guns in each wing to four .303 in ( 7.7 mm ) Brownings , following a recommendation by Squadron Leader Ralph Sorley of the Operational Requirements section at the Air Ministry . On 5 March 1936 , the prototype ( K5054 ) took off on its first flight from Eastleigh Aerodrome ( later Southampton Airport ) . At the controls was Captain Joseph \" Mutt \" Summers , chief test pilot for Vickers , who is quoted as saying \" Don 't touch anything \" on landing . This eight-minute flight came four months after the maiden flight of the contemporary Hurricane . K5054 was fitted with a new propeller , and Summers flew the aircraft on 10 March 1936 ; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time . After the fourth flight , a new engine was fitted , and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants , Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering . They soon discovered that the Spitfire was a very good aircraft , but not perfect . The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just 330 mph ( 528 km / h ) , little faster than Sydney Camm 's new Merlin-powered Hurricane . A new and better-shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348 mph ( 557 km / h ) in level flight in mid-May , when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment ( A & AEE ) . Here , Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes-Jones took over the prototype for the RAF . He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing . Edwardes-Jones 's report was positive ; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage position indicator . A week later , on 3 June 1936 , the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires , before any formal report had been issued by the A & AEE ; interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis . = = = Initial production = = = The British public first saw the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936 . Although full-scale production was supposed to begin immediately , there were numerous problems that could not be overcome for some time and the first production Spitfire , K9787 , did not roll off the Woolston , Southampton assembly line until mid-1938 . The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats . Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components , especially the wings , Vickers-Armstrong ( the parent company ) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents . As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production , the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310 , after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters . The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938 , the two orders covering the K , L and N prefix serial numbers . In February 1936 the director of Vickers-Armstrongs , Sir Robert MacLean , guaranteed production of five aircraft a week , beginning 15 months after an order was placed . On 3 June 1936 , the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 aircraft , for a price of \u00a3 1,395,000 . Full-scale production of the Spitfire began at Supermarine 's facility in Woolston , Southampton , but it quickly became clear that the order could not be completed in the 15 months promised . Supermarine was a small company , already busy building Walrus and Stranraer flying boats , and Vickers was busy building the Wellingtons . The initial solution was to subcontract the work . The first production Spitfire rolled off the assembly line in mid-1938 , and was flown by Jeffrey Quill on 15 May 1938 , almost 24 months after the initial order . The final cost of the first 310 aircraft , after delays and increased programme costs , came to \u00a3 1,870,242 or \u00a3 1,533 more per aircraft than originally estimated . Production aircraft cost about \u00a3 9,500 . The most expensive components were the hand-fabricated and finished fuselage at approximately \u00a3 2,500 , then the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine at \u00a3 2,000 , followed by the wings at \u00a3 1,800 a pair , guns and undercarriage , both at \u00a3 800 each , and the propeller at \u00a3 350 . = = = Manufacturing at Castle Bromwich , Birmingham = = = In 1935 , the Air Ministry approached Morris Motors Limited to ask how quickly their Cowley plant could be turned to aircraft production . In 1936 this informal request for major manufacturing facilities was turned into a formal scheme to boost British aircraft production capacity under the leadership of Herbert Austin , known as the Shadow factory plan . Austin was given the task of building nine new factories , and to supplement the existing British car manufacturing industry by either adding to overall capacity or increasing the potential for reorganisation to produce aircraft and their engines . Under the plan , on 12 July 1938 , the Air Ministry bought a site consisting of farm fields and a sewage works next to Castle Bromwich Aerodrome in Birmingham . This shadow factory would supplement Supermarine 's original factories in Southampton in building the Spitfire . The Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory ordered the most modern machine tools then available , which were being installed two months after work started on the site . Although Morris Motors under Lord Nuffield ( an expert in mass motor-vehicle construction ) at first managed and equipped the factory , it was funded by government money . When the project was first mooted it was estimated that the factory would be built for \u00a3 2,000,000 , however , by the beginning of 1939 this cost had doubled to over \u00a3 4,000,000 . The Spitfire 's stressed-skin construction required precision engineering skills and techniques outside the experience of the local labour force , which took some time to train . However , even as the first Spitfires were being built in June 1940 the factory was still incomplete , and there were numerous problems with the factory management , which ignored tooling and drawings provided by Supermarine in favour of tools and drawings of its own designs , and with the workforce which , while not completely stopping production , continually threatened strikes or \" slow downs \" until their demands for higher than average pay rates were met . By May 1940 , Castle Bromwich had not yet built its first Spitfire , in spite of promises that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April . On 17 May Lord Beaverbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production , telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing over control of the Castle Bromwich plant to Beaverbook 's Ministry . Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced management staff and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave over control of the factory to Vickers-Armstrong . Although it would take some time to resolve the problems , in June 1940 , 10 Mk IIs were built ; 23 rolled out in July , 37 in August , and 56 in September . By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945 , a total of 12,129 Spitfires ( 921 Mk IIs , 4,489 Mk Vs , 5,665 Mk IXs , and 1,054 Mk XVIs ) had been built . CBAF went on to become the largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939 \u2013 45 conflict . As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK , by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month , it built over half of the approximately 20,000 aircraft of this type . = = = Production dispersal = = = During the Battle of Britain , concerted efforts were made by the Luftwaffe to destroy the main manufacturing plants at Woolston and Itchen , near Southampton . The first bombing raid , which missed the factories , came on 23 August 1940 . Over the next month , other raids were mounted until , on 26 September 1940 , both factories were completely wrecked , with 92 people being killed and a large number injured ; most of the casualties were experienced aircraft production workers . Fortunately for the future of the Spitfire , many of the production jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September , and steps were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area . To this end , the British government requisitioned the likes of Vincent 's Garage in Station Square Reading , which later specialised in manufacturing Spitfire fuselages , and Anna Valley Motors , Salisbury , which was to become the sole producer of the wing leading-edge fuel tanks for photo-reconnaissance Spitfires , as well as producing other components . A purpose-built works , specialising in manufacturing fuselages and installing engines , was built at Star Road , Caversham in Reading . The drawing office in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park , near Southampton . This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled , but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley . Four towns and their satellite airfields were chosen to be the focal points for these workshops : Southampton and Eastleigh Airport Salisbury with High Post and Chattis Hill aerodromes Trowbridge with Keevil aerodrome Reading with Henley and Aldermaston aerodromes . An experimental factory at Newbury was the subject of a Luftwaffe daylight raid but all missed their target and bombed a nearby school . Completed Spitfires were delivered to the airfields on large Commer \" Queen Mary \" low-loader articulated trucks , there to be fully assembled , tested , then passed on to the RAF . = = = Flight testing = = = All production Spitfires were flight tested before delivery . During the Second World War , Jeffrey Quill was Vickers Supermarine 's chief test pilot , in charge of flight-testing all aircraft types built by Vickers Supermarine ; he also oversaw a group of 10 to 12 pilots responsible for testing all developmental and production Spitfires built by the company in the Southampton area . Quill had also devised the standard testing procedures which , with variations for specific aircraft designs , operated from 1938 . Alex Henshaw , chief test pilot at Castle Bromwich from 1940 , was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory , co-ordinating a team of 25 pilots ; he also assessed all Spitfire developments . Between 1940 and 1946 , Henshaw flew a total of 2,360 Spitfires and Seafires , more than 10 % of total production . Henshaw wrote about flight testing Spitfires : After a thorough pre-flight check I would take off and , once at circuit height , I would trim the aircraft and try to get her to fly straight and level with hands off the stick ... Once the trim was satisfactory I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850 rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers . Then I would make a careful check of the power output from the engine , calibrated for height and temperature ... If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000 rpm , and trim her to fly hands and feet off at 460 mph ( 740 km / h ) IAS ( Indicated Air Speed ) . Personally , I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was . The production test was usually quite a brisk affair : the initial circuit lasted less than ten minutes and the main flight took between twenty and thirty minutes . Then the aircraft received a final once-over by our ground mechanics , any faults were rectified and the Spitfire was ready for collection . I loved the Spitfire in all of her many versions . But I have to admit that the later marks , although they were faster than the earlier ones , were also much heavier and so did not handle so well . You did not have such positive control over them . One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled . With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half . With the later and still heavier versions , one got even less . The essence of aircraft design is compromise , and an improvement at one end of the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else . When the last Spitfire rolled out in February 1948 , a total of 20,351 examples of all variants had been built , including two-seat trainers , with some Spitfires remaining in service well into the 1950s . The Spitfire was the only British fighter aircraft to be in continuous production before , during and after the Second World War . = = Design = = = = = Airframe = = = In the mid-1930s , aviation design teams worldwide started developing a new generation of all-metal , low-wing fighter aircraft . The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany 's Messerschmitt Bf 109 , for example , were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered , liquid-cooled , in-line aero engines . They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages , fully enclosed cockpits and low drag , all-metal wings ( all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military , who favoured the biplane 's simplicity and manoeuvrability ) . Mitchell 's design aims were to create a well-balanced , high-performance bomber interceptor and fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting the power of the Merlin engine , while being relatively easy to fly . At the time , with France as an ally , and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent , no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain , enemy bombers would be required to fly to the UK over the North Sea and no single engined fighter at the time had the range to accompany the bombers and successfully return to its own friendly airfields ; to carry out the mission of home defence , the design was intended to climb quickly to meet enemy bombers . The Spitfire 's airframe was complex : the streamlined , semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage featured a large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers , also known as frames , starting from frame number one , immediately behind the propeller unit , to the tail unit attachment frame . The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings . Frame 5 , to which the engine bearers were secured , supported the weight of the engine and accessories , and the loads imposed by the engine : this was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and , in later versions of the Spitfire , the oil tank . This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons to the rest of the airframe . Behind the bulkhead were five ' U ' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit . The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame , to which the pilot 's seat and ( later ) armour plating was attached , and ended at the nineteenth , which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin . Each of these nine frames were oval , reducing in size towards the tail , and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them . The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached . Frames 21 , 22 and 23 formed the fin ; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post . Before being attached to the main fuselage , the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them . A combination of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons attached to the frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached . The fuselage plating was 24 , 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail , while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23 , before being covered in 22 gauge plating . The skins of the fuselage , wings and tailplane were secured by rivets and in critical areas such as the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required , with flush rivets ; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting . From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage , affecting all Spitfire variants . In some areas , such as at the rear of the wing , and the lower tailplane skins the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs . The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin skinned spruce formers . At first the ailerons , elevators and rudder were fabric-covered . When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds , a light alloy replaced the fabric , enhancing control throughout the speed range . = = = Elliptical wing design = = = In 1934 , Mitchell and the design staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two conflicting requirements ; the wing needed to be thin , to avoid creating too much drag , while still able to house a retractable undercarriage , plus armament and ammunition . An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing , leading to the lowest amount of induced drag . The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure , which occurs at the quarter-chord position , aligned with the main spar , thus preventing the wings from twisting . Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70 , which first flew in 1932 ; but as Beverley Shenstone , the aerodynamicist on Mitchell 's team , explained \" Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section to that of the Heinkel . In any case it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose . \" The wing section used was from the NACA 2200 series , which had been adapted to create a thickness-to-chord ratio of 13 % at the root , reducing to 9.4 % at the tip . A dihedral of six degrees was adopted to give increased lateral stability . A feature of the wing which contributed greatly to its success was an innovative spar boom design , made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other . As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away in a similar fashion to a leaf spring ; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web , creating a lightweight and very strong main spar . The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner , rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure . The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing . Ahead of the spar , the thick-skinned leading edge of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box , which took most of the wing loads . At the time the wing was designed , this D-shaped leading edge was intended to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII . Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100 % glycol . The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough ; this used the cooling air to generate thrust , greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators . In turn , the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser , but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes , a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938 . Another feature of the wing was its washout . The trailing edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span , the angle of incidence decreasing from + 2 \u00b0 at its root to - \u00bd \u00b0 at its tip . This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips , reducing tip-stall that could otherwise have resulted in a wing drop , often leading to a spin . As the wing roots started to stall , the separating air stream started to buffet ( vibrate ) the aircraft , warning the pilot , and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance . This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire . The complexity of the wing design , especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures , at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire . The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors , most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured , high-speed aircraft . By June 1939 , most of these problems had been resolved , and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings . All of the main flight controls were originally metal structures with fabric covering.Designers and pilots felt that having ailerons which were too heavy to move ( in terms of effort , not mass ) at high speed would avoid possible aileron reversal , stopping pilots throwing the aircraft around and pulling the wings off . It was also felt that air combat would take place at relatively low speed and that high-speed manoeuvring would be physically impossible . During the Battle of Britain , pilots found the ailerons of the Spitfire were far too heavy at high speeds , severely restricting lateral manoeuvres such as rolls and high-speed turns , which were still a feature of air-to-air combat . Flight tests showed the fabric covering of the ailerons \" ballooned \" at high speeds , adversely affecting the aerodynamics . Replacing the fabric covering with light alloy dramatically improved the ailerons at high speed . The Spitfire had detachable wing tips which were secured by two mounting points at the end of each main wing assembly : when the Spitfire took on a role as a high-altitude fighter ( Marks VI and VII and some early Mk VIIIs ) the standard wing tips were replaced by extended , \" pointed \" tips which increased the wingspan from 36 ft 10 in ( 11.23 m ) to 40 ft 2 in ( 12.3 m ) . The other wing tip variation , used by several Spitfire variants , was the \" clipped \" wing ; the standard wing tips were replaced by wooden fairings which reduced the span to 32 ft 6 in ( 9.9 m ) The wing tips used spruce formers for most of the internal structure with a light alloy skin attached using brass screws . The airflow through the main radiator was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps . In early marks of Spitfire ( Mk I to Mk VI ) the single flap was operated manually using a lever to the left of the pilot 's seat . When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator ; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside . Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit . The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat . The light alloy split flaps at the trailing edge of the wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel . Only two positions were available ; fully up or fully down ( 85 \u00b0 ) . The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing , and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing . The ellipse also served as the design basis for the Spitfire 's fin and tailplane assembly , once again exploiting the shape 's favourable aerodynamic characteristics . Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward , thus reducing control-surface flutter . The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and , later , horizontal tail surfaces to compensate for the altered aerodynamics , culminating in those of the Mk 22 / 24 series which were 25 % larger in area than those of the Mk I. = = = Improved late wing designs = = = As the Spitfire gained more power and was able to manoeuvre at higher speeds , the possibility that pilots would encounter aileron reversal increased , and the Supermarine design team set about redesigning the wings to counter this . The original wing design had a theoretical aileron reversal speed of 580 mph ( 930 km / h ) , which was somewhat lower than that of some contemporary fighters . The Royal Aircraft Establishment noted that , at 400 mph ( 640 km / h ) IAS , roughly 65 % of aileron effectiveness was lost , due to wing twist . The new wing of the Spitfire F Mk 21 and its successors was designed to help alleviate this problem ; the wing 's stiffness was increased by 47 % , and a new design of aileron using piano hinges and geared trim tabs meant that the theoretical aileron reversal speed was increased to 825 mph ( 1,328 km / h ) . Alongside the redesigned wing Supermarine also experimented with the original wing , raising the leading edge by one inch ( 2.54 cm ) , with the hope of improving pilot view and reducing drag . This wing was tested on a modified F Mk 21 , also called the F Mk 23 , ( sometimes referred to as \" Valiant \" rather than \" Spitfire \" ) . The increase in performance was minimal and this experiment was abandoned . Supermarine developed a new laminar flow wing based on new aerofoil profiles developed by NACA in the United States , with the objective of reducing drag and improving performance . These laminar flow airfoils were the Supermarine 371-I used at the root and the 371-II used at the tip . Supermarine estimated that the new wing could give an increase in speed of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) over the Spitfire Mk 21 . The new wing was initially fitted to a Spitfire Mk XIV ; later a new fuselage was designed , with the new fighter becoming the Supermarine Spiteful . Somewhat surprisingly , the new trapezoid wing had lower critical Mach number than the old elliptic one , bringing one of the test pilots who flew the \" jet Spiteful \" ( the Supermarine Attacker ) to remark that the original wing should have been retained on the jet . = = = Carburetion versus fuel injection = = = Early in its development , the Merlin engine 's lack of fuel injection meant that Spitfires and Hurricanes , unlike the Bf 109E , were unable to simply nose down into a steep dive . This meant a Luftwaffe fighter could simply \" bunt \" into a high-power dive to escape an attack , leaving the Spitfire behind , as its fuel was forced out of the carburettor by negative \" g \" . RAF fighter pilots soon learned to \" half-roll \" their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents . Carburettors were adopted because , as Sir Stanley Hooker explained , the carburettor \" increased the performance of the supercharger and thereby increased the power of the engine . \" In March 1941 , a metal disc with a hole was fitted in the fuel line , restricting fuel flow to the maximum the engine could consume . While it did not cure the problem of the initial fuel starvation in a dive , it did reduce the more serious problem of the carburettor being flooded with fuel by the fuel pumps under negative \" g \" . It became known as \" Miss Shilling 's orifice \" as it was invented by Beatrice \" Tilly \" Shilling . Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin series , with Bendix-manufactured pressure carburettors , which were designed to allow fuel to flow during all flight attitudes , introduced in 1942 . = = = Armament = = = Due to a shortage of Brownings , which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934 , early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns , with the other four fitted later . Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly on the ground and at low altitudes , they tended to freeze at high altitude , especially the outer wing guns . This was because the RAF 's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt ; while this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition , it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered . Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938 , when they added hot air ducts from the rear of the wing mounted radiators to the guns , and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing . Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold , dirt and moisture until they were fired . Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly , pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft . Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft . In November 1938 , tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon of at least 20 mm calibre was urgently needed . A variant on the Spitfire design with four 20 mm Oerlikon cannon had been tendered to specification F37 / 35 but the order for prototypes had gone to the Westland Whirlwind in January 1939 . In June 1939 , a Spitfire was fitted with a drum-fed Hispano in each wing , an installation that required large blisters on the wing to cover the 60-round drum . The cannon suffered frequent stoppages , mostly because the guns were mounted on their sides to fit as much of the magazine as possible within the wing . In January 1940 , P / O George Proudman flew this prototype in combat , but the starboard gun stopped after firing a single round , while the port gun fired 30 rounds before seizing . If one cannon seized , the recoil of the other threw the aircraft off aim . Nevertheless , 30 more cannon-armed Spitfires were ordered for operational trials , and they were soon known as the Mk IB , to distinguish them from the Browning-armed Mk IA , and were delivered to No. 19 Squadron beginning in June 1940 . The Hispanos were found to be so unreliable that the squadron requested an exchange of its aircraft with the older Browning-armed aircraft of an operational training unit . By August , Supermarine had perfected a more reliable installation with an improved feed mechanism and four .303s in the outer wing panels . The modified fighters were then delivered to 19 Squadron . = = Operational history = = = = = Service operations = = = The operational history of the Spitfire with the RAF started with the first Mk Is K9789 , which entered service with 19 Squadron at RAF Duxford on 4 August 1938 . The Spitfire achieved legendary status during the Battle of Britain , a reputation aided by the famous \" Spitfire Fund \" organised and run by Lord Beaverbrook , the Minister of Aircraft Production . In fact the Hurricane outnumbered the Spitfire throughout the battle , and shouldered the burden of the defence against the Luftwaffe ; however , because of its higher performance the overall attrition rate of the Spitfire squadrons was lower than that of the Hurricane units , and the Spitfire units had a higher victory-to-loss ratio . The key aim of Fighter Command was to stop the Luftwaffe 's bombers ; in practice the tactic , whenever possible , was to use Spitfires to counter German escort fighters , by then based in northern France , particularly the Bf 109s , while the Hurricane squadrons attacked the bombers . Well-known Spitfire pilots included \" Johnnie \" Johnson ( 34 enemy aircraft shot down ) , who flew the Spitfire right through his operational career from late 1940 to 1945 . Douglas Bader ( 20 e / a ) and \" Bob \" Tuck ( 27 e / a ) flew Spitfires and Hurricanes during the major air battles of 1940 , and both were shot down and became prisoners of war while flying Spitfires over France in 1941 and 1942 . Paddy Finucane ( 28 \u2013 32 e / a ) scored all his successes in the fighter before disappearing over the English Channel in July 1942 . Some notable Commonwealth pilots were George Beurling ( 311 \u2044 3 e / a ) from Canada , \" Sailor \" Malan ( 27 e / a ) from South Africa , New Zealanders Alan Deere ( 17 e / a ) and C F Gray ( 27 e / a ) and the Australian Hugo Armstrong ( 12 e / a ) . The Spitfire continued to play increasingly diverse roles throughout the Second World War and beyond , often in air forces other than the RAF . The Spitfire , for example , became the first high-speed photo-reconnaissance aircraft to be operated by the RAF . Sometimes unarmed , they flew at high , medium and low altitudes , often ranging far into enemy territory to closely observe the Axis powers and provide an almost continual flow of valuable intelligence information throughout the war . In 1941 and 1942 , PRU Spitfires provided the first photographs of the Freya and W\u00fcrzburg radar systems and , in 1943 , helped confirm that the Germans were building the V1 and V2 Vergeltungswaffe ( \" vengeance weapons \" ) by photographing Peenem\u00fcnde , on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany . In the Mediterranean the Spitfire blunted the heavy attacks on Malta by the Regia Aeronautica and Luftwaffe and , from early 1943 , helped pave the way for the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy . On 7 March 1942 , 15 Mk Vs carrying 90-gallon fuel tanks under their bellies took off from HMS Eagle off the coast of Algeria on a 600-mile flight to Malta . Those Spitfires V were the first to see service outside Britain . The Spitfire also served on the Eastern Front : approximately a thousand were supplied to the Soviet Air Force . Though some were used at the frontline in 1943 , most of them saw service with the Protivo-Vozdushnaya Oborona ( English : \" Anti-air Defence Branch \" ) . The Spitfire also served in the Pacific Theater . During the Malaya campaign in defense of Singapore , the Spitfire met its match in the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero . \" The RAF pilots were trained in methods that were excellent against German and Italian equipment but suicide against the acrobatic Japs . \" as Lt.Gen. Claire Lee Chennault had to notice . Although not as fast as the Spitfire , the Zero could out-turn the Spitfire with ease , could sustain a climb at a very steep angle , and could stay in the air for three times as long . To counter the Zero , Spitfire pilots had to adopt a \" slash and run \" policy and use their superior speed and diving superiority to fight while avoiding classic dogfights . It also did not help that Southeast Asia was a lower-priority area which was allocated few Spitfires and other modern fighters compared to Europe , which allowed the Japanese to easily achieve air superiority by 1942 . Over the Northern Territory of Australia , RAAF and RAF Spitfires helped defend the port town of Darwin against air attack by the Japanese Naval Air Force . Spitfire MKVIII 's took part in the last battle of WWII involving the Western allies , in Burma as a ground attack role , helping to defeat a Japanese break-out attempt . During the Second World War , Spitfires were used by the USAAF in the 4th Fighter Group until replaced by Republic P-47 Thunderbolts in March 1943 . The Spitfire is listed in the appendix to the novel KG 200 as \" known to have been regularly flown by \" the German secret operations unit KG 200 , which tested , evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the Second World War . = = = Speed and altitude records = = = Beginning in late 1943 , high-speed diving trials were undertaken at Farnborough to investigate the handling characteristics of aircraft travelling at speeds near the sound barrier ( i.e. , the onset of compressibility effects ) . Because it had the highest limiting Mach number of any aircraft at that time , a Spitfire XI was chosen to take part in these trials . Due to the high altitudes necessary for these dives , a fully feathering Rotol propeller was fitted to prevent overspeeding . It was during these trials that EN409 , flown by Squadron Leader J. R. Tobin , reached 606 mph ( 975 km / h , Mach 0.891 ) in a 45 \u00b0 dive . In April 1944 , the same aircraft suffered engine failure in another dive while being flown by Squadron Leader Anthony F. Martindale , RAFVR , when the propeller and reduction gear broke off . The dive put the aircraft to Mach 0.92 , the fastest ever recorded in a piston-engined aircraft , but when the propeller came off the Spitfire , now tail-heavy , zoom-climbed back to altitude . Martindale blacked out under the 11g loading , but when he resumed consciousness he found the aircraft at about 40,000 feet with its ( originally straight ) wings now slightly swept back . Martindale successfully glided the Spitfire 20 mi ( 32 km ) back to the airfield and landed safely . Martindale was awarded the Air Force Cross for his exploits . A Spitfire was modified by the RAE for high-speed testing of the stabilator ( then known as the \" flying tail \" ) of the Miles M.52 supersonic research aircraft . RAE test pilot Eric Brown stated that he tested this successfully during October and November 1944 , attaining Mach 0.86 in a dive . On 5 February 1952 , a Spitfire 19 of 81 Squadron based at Kai Tak in Hong Kong reached probably the highest altitude ever achieved by a Spitfire . The pilot , Flight Lieutenant Ted Powles , was on a routine flight to survey outside-air temperature and report on other meteorological conditions at various altitudes in preparation for a proposed new air service through the area . He climbed to 50,000 ft ( 15,240 m ) indicated altitude , with a true altitude of 51,550 ft ( 15,712 m ) . The cabin pressure fell below a safe level and , in trying to reduce altitude , he entered an uncontrollable dive which shook the aircraft violently . He eventually regained control somewhere below 3,000 ft ( 900 m ) and landed safely with no discernible damage to his aircraft . Evaluation of the recorded flight data suggested that , in the dive , he achieved a speed of 690 mph ( 1,110 km / h , Mach 0.96 ) , which would have been the highest speed ever reached by a propeller-driven aircraft , but it has been speculated this figure resulted from inherent instrument errors . The critical Mach number of the Spitfire 's original elliptical wing was higher than the subsequently used laminar-flow-section , straight-tapering-planform wing of the follow-on Supermarine Spiteful , Seafang and Attacker , illustrating that Reginald Mitchell 's practical engineering approach to the problems of high-speed flight had paid off . = = Variants = = = = = Overview = = = Although R. J. Mitchell is justifiably known as the engineer who designed the Spitfire , his premature death in 1937 meant that all development after that date was undertaken by a team led by his chief draughtsman , Joe Smith , who became Supermarine 's chief designer on Mitchell 's death . As Jeffrey Quill noted : \" If Mitchell was born to design the Spitfire , Joe Smith was born to defend and develop it . \" There were 24 marks of Spitfire and many sub-variants . These covered the Spitfire in development from the Merlin to Griffon engines , the high-speed photo-reconnaissance variants and the different wing configurations . More Spitfire Mk Vs were built than any other type , with 6,487 built , followed by the 5,656 Mk IXs . Different wings , featuring a variety of weapons , were fitted to most marks ; the A wing used eight .303 in ( 7.7 mm ) machine guns , the B wing had four .303 in ( 7.7 mm ) machine guns and two 20 mm ( .79 in ) Hispano cannon , and the C , or universal , wing could mount either four 20 mm ( .79 in ) cannon or two 20 mm ( .79 in ) and four .303 in ( 7.7 mm ) machine guns . As the war progressed , the C wing became more common . Another armament variation was the E wing which housed two 20 mm ( .79 in ) cannon and two .50 in ( 12.7 mm ) Browning machine guns . Although the Spitfire continued to improve in speed and armament , because of its limited fuel capacity its range and endurance were also limited : it remained \" short-legged \" throughout its life except in the dedicated photo-reconnaissance role , when its guns were replaced by extra fuel tanks . Supermarine developed a two-seat variant known as the T Mk VIII to be used for training , but none were ordered , and only one example was ever constructed ( identified as N32 / G-AIDN by Supermarine ) . In the absence of an official two-seater variant , a number of airframes were crudely converted in the field . These included a 4 Squadron SAAF Mk VB in North Africa , where a second seat was fitted instead of the upper fuel tank in front of the cockpit , although it was not a dual-control aircraft and is thought to have been used as the squadron \" run-about \" . The only unofficial two-seat conversions that were fitted with dual-controls were a small number of Russian lend / lease Mk IX aircraft . These were referred to as Mk IX UTI and differed from the Supermarine proposals by using an inline \" greenhouse \" style double canopy rather than the raised \" bubble \" type of the T Mk VIII . In the postwar era , the idea was revived by Supermarine and a number of two-seat Spitfires were built by converting old Mk IX airframes with a second \" raised \" cockpit featuring a bubble canopy . Ten of these TR9 variants were then sold to the Indian Air Force along with six to the Irish Air Corps , three to the Royal Netherlands Air Force and one for the Royal Egyptian Air Force . Currently several of the trainers are known to exist , including both the T Mk VIII , a T Mk IX based in the US , and the \" Grace Spitfire \" ML407 , a veteran flown operationally by 485 ( NZ ) Squadron in 1944 . = = = Seafire = = = The Seafire , a name derived from sea , and Spitfire , was a naval version of the Spitfire specially adapted for operation from aircraft carriers . Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations , it was considered to be the best available fighter at the time . The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations on the use of the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter ; poor visibility over the nose , for example , meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking alongside the port cowling of their Seafire ; also , like the Spitfire , the Seafire had a relatively narrow undercarriage track , which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations . Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe ; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes , folding wings , arrestor hooks and other modifications , culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F / FR Mk 47 . The Seafire II was able to outperform the A6M5 Zero at low altitudes when the two types were tested against each other during wartime mock combat exercises . However , contemporary Allied carrier fighters such as the F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair were considerably more robust and so more practical for carrier operations . Performance was greatly increased when later versions of the Seafire were fitted with the Griffon engines . These were too late to see service in the Second World War . = = = Griffon-engined variants = = = The first Rolls Royce Griffon-engined Mk XII flew on August 1942 , and first flew operationally with 41 Squadron in April 1943 . This mark could nudge 400 mph ( 640 km / h ) in level flight and climb to an altitude of 33,000 ft ( 10,000 m ) in under nine minutes . As American fighters took over the long-range escorting of USAAF daylight bombing raids , the Griffon-engined Spitfires progressively took up the tactical air superiority role , and played a major role in intercepting V-1 flying bombs , while the Merlin-engined variants ( mainly the Mk IX and the Packard-engined Mk XVI ) were adapted to the fighter-bomber role . Although the later Griffon-engined marks lost some of the favourable handling characteristics of their Merlin-powered predecessors , they could still outmanoeuvre their main German foes and other , later American and British-designed fighters . The final version of the Spitfire , the Mk 24 , first flew at South Marston on 13 April 1946 . On 20 February 1948 , almost twelve years from the prototype 's first flight , the last production Spitfire , VN496 , left the production line . Spitfire Mk 24s were used by only one regular RAF unit , with 80 Squadron replacing their Hawker Tempests with F Mk 24s in 1947 . With these planes , 80 Squadron continued its patrol and reconnaissance duties from Wunstorf in Germany as part of the occupation forces , until it relocated to Kai Tak Airport , Hong Kong in July 1949 . During the Chinese Civil War , 80 Squadron 's main duty was to defend Hong Kong from perceived Communist threats . Operation Firedog during the Malayan Emergency saw the Spitfire fly over 1,800 operational sorties against the Malaysian Communists . The last operational sortie of an RAF Spitfire was flown on 1 April 1954 , by PR Mk 19 Spitfire PS888 flying from RAF Seletar , in Singapore . The last non-operational flight of a Spitfire in RAF service , which took place on 9 June 1957 , was by a PR Mk 19 , PS583 , from RAF Woodvale of the Temperature and Humidity Flight . This was also the last known flight of a piston-engined fighter in the RAF . The last nation in the Middle East to operate Spitfires was Syria , which kept its F 22s until 1953 . In late 1962 , Air Marshal Sir John Nicholls instigated a trial when he flew Spitfire PM631 , a PR Mk 19 in the custody of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight , against an English Electric Lightning F 3 ( a supersonic jet-engined interceptor ) in mock combat at RAF Binbrook . At the time British Commonwealth forces were involved in possible action against Indonesia over Malaya and Nicholls decided to develop tactics to fight the Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang , a fighter that had a similar performance to the PR Mk 19 . The first airframe ( PM631 ) developed mechanical issues which removed it from the trial . Another PR Mk 19 , PS853 which is now owned by Rolls-Royce , was on gate-guard duties at Binbrook , having been retired from the BBMF one year before . It had been maintained in running condition by ground crews at Binbrook , and after a short time was participating in the trials . At the end of the trials , RAF pilots found that Firestreak infra-red guided missiles had trouble acquiring the Spitfire due to a low exhaust temperature , and decided that the twin ADEN 30 mm ( 1 in ) cannons were the only weapons suited to the task , which was complicated by the tight turning circle of the Spitfire and the Lightning 's proclivity for over-running the Spitfire . It was concluded that the most effective and safest way for a modern jet-engined fighter to attack a piston-engined fighter was to engage full afterburner at an altitude lower than the Spitfire , and behind it to perform a hit-and-run attack , contrary to all established fighter-on-fighter doctrine at that time . = = Operators = = = = Surviving aircraft = = There are approximately 55 Spitfires and a few Seafires in airworthy condition worldwide , although many air museums have examples on static display , for example , Chicago 's Museum of Science and Industry has paired a static Spitfire with a static Ju 87 R-2 / Trop . Stuka dive bomber . The oldest surviving Spitfire is a Mark 1 , serial number K9942 ; it is preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Shropshire . This aircraft was the 155th built and first flew in April 1939 . It flew operationally with No. 72 Squadron RAF until June 1940 , when it was damaged in a wheels-up landing . After repair , it was used for training until August 1944 , when it became one of several Battle of Britain aircraft veterans that were allocated to the Air Historical Branch for future museum preservation . What may be the most originally restored Spitfire in the world is maintained in airworthy condition at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City , Florida . Over a six-year period in the 1990s , this aircraft was slowly restored by Personal Plane Services in England using almost 90 % of its original aircraft skins . Owner Kermit Weeks insisted that the aircraft be restored to original condition as closely as possible . Machine guns , cannon , gun sight and original working radios are all installed . Two MK 1 Supermarine Spitfires originally restored remain in a flying condition at the Imperial War Museum Duxford , in Cambridgeshire , England . Both restored by American billionaire Thomas Kaplan , one has been donated to the Imperial War Museum and the second was auctioned in July 2015 at Christie 's , London . Being only one of four flying MK 1 Spitfires in the world , the aircraft fetched a record \u00a3 3.1 million at auction on 9 July , beating the previous record for a Spitfire of \u00a3 1.7 million set in 2009 . = = = Surviving Spitfires in Burma = = = After hostilities ceased in Asia in 1945 , a number of Spitfire Mk.XIVs were reportedly buried , after being greased , tarred and prepared for long-term storage , in crates in Burma . Excavations carried out in early 2013 failed to locate any of the rumoured aircraft . It is widely reported from numerous sources that aircraft from RAF bases in Burma were actually crated up and shipped out for reuse in elsewhere . = = Memorials = = A fibreglass replica of the Mk.1 Spitfire Mk1 YT-J ( R6675 ) , flown by Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill during his brief period of active service with 65 Squadron is on display at the Battle of Britain memorial at Capel-le-Ferne near Folkestone , along with a replica Mk.1 Hurricane representing US-X , in which Pilot Officer Geoffrey Page was shot down on 12 August 1940 . Sentinel is a sculpture depicting three Spitfires in flight by Tim Tolkien at the roundabout junction ( popularly known as Spitfire Island ) of the A47 and A452 in Castle Bromwich , Birmingham England , commemorating the main Spitfire factory . The island sits at the adjoining southern corners of the former Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory and Aerodrome ( now Castle Vale housing estate ) . There is also both a Spitfire and a Hurricane in the nearby Thinktank Science Museum . A sculpture of the prototype Spitfire , K5054 , stands on the roundabout at the entrance to Southampton International Airport , which , as Eastleigh Aerodrome , saw the first flight of the aircraft in March 1936 . Jeffrey Quill , the former Supermarine test pilot , initiated a project to build an exact replica of K5054 , the prototype Spitfire to be put on permanent public display as a memorial to R.J. Mitchell . A team of original Supermarine designers worked with Aerofab Restorations of Andover for 10 years to create the facsimile . It was unveiled to the public in April 1993 by Quill at the RAF Museum , Hendon , and is currently on loan to the Tangmere Military Aviation Museum . A fibreglass replica in the colours of a Polish Squadron Leader based at the station during the Second World War is on display at RAF Northolt , the last Battle of Britain Sector Station still in RAF operational service . A replica Spitfire is on display on the Thornaby Road roundabout near the school named after Sir Douglas Bader who flew a Spitfire in the Second World War . This memorial is in memory of the old RAF base in Thornaby which is now a residential estate . A fibreglass replica of a Spitfire has been mounted on a pylon in Memorial Park , Hamilton , New Zealand as a tribute to all New Zealand fighter pilots who flew Spitfires during the Second World War . At Bentley Priory , the Second World War command centre for Fighter Command , fibreglass replicas of a Spitfire Mk 1 and a Hurricane Mk 1 can be seen fixed in a position of attack . This was built as a memorial to everyone who worked at Bentley Priory during the war . A fibreglass replica in the colours of 603 ( City of Edinburgh ) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force Spitfire Memorial next to the Edinburgh Airport control tower .

Lodge Hill Garage , Abingdon , Oxfordshire has a full-size replica Spitfire as its own rooftop monument . Owner Peter Jewson bought the replica in a campaign to build the first ever national memorial to honour the 166 women from the Air Transport Auxiliary ( ATA ) who flew Spitfires and other aircraft from factories to their operational airbases ; 14 died during these ferry flights . A fibreglass replica of a Spitfire Mk IX is mounted to the roof of the speciality shop , Spitfire Emporium , in Kitchener , Ontario . There is a replica of a Spitfire ( and of a Hurricane ) at the entrance to the Eden Camp Modern History Museum as a memorial to pilots who served in the Battle of Britain . Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre has a full size replica Spitfire MkVb LO-D ( EP121 ) on display as a memorial to the men and women who served at RFC / RAF Montrose . = = Replicas = = Several small manufacturers have produced replica Spitfires , either as complete aircraft , or as kits for self-building . These range in scale from \u00be full scale to full-size , although most use wooden construction , rather than the original all-metal monocoque design . The British Historic Flying Company has either restored or built from scratch a significant proportion of the Spitfires that are now air-worthy . Other examples include the Jurca Spit from France , and those manufactured by Tally Ho Enterprises in Canada , SAC in California , USA , and even the microlight Silence Twister from Germany . Supermarine Aircraft originally from Brisbane , Australia , and now based in Cisco Texas , manufacture the 80 % scale Spitfire Mk 26 and the 90 % scale Mk 26B replicas . The Supermarine Spitfire Mk 26 and 26B are supplied in kit form and are the only all-aluminium reproduction Spitfires in production . The Isaacs Spitfire is a homebuilt 60 % scale replica . = = Notable appearances in media = = During and after the Battle of Britain the Spitfire became a symbol of British resistance : for example , Lord Beaverbrook 's \" Spitfire Fund \" of 1940 was one campaign which drew widespread public attention to the Spitfire . The Spitfire continues to be highly popular at airshows , on airfields and in museums worldwide , and continues to hold an important place in the memories of many people , especially the few still living who flew the Spitfire in combat . Numerous films and documentaries featuring the Spitfire are still being produced , some of which are listed in this section . The First of the Few ( also known as Spitfire in the US and Canada ) ( 1942 ) was a British film produced and directed by Leslie Howard , with Howard in the starring role of R.J. Mitchell , and David Niven playing a composite character based on the Schneider Trophy pilots of 1927 , 1929 and 1931 , and the Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill . Some of the footage includes film shot in 1941 of operational Spitfires and pilots of 501 Squadron ( code letters SD ) . Howard spent a long time researching the history of the Spitfire 's development for the film ; Mrs. Mitchell and her son Gordon were on the set during much of the production . The aerobatic flying sequences featured in the last 15 minutes of the film were made by Jeffrey Quill in early November 1941 , flying a Spitfire Mk II mocked up to represent the prototype . Malta Story ( 1953 ) , starring Alec Guinness , Jack Hawkins , Anthony Steel and Muriel Pavlow , is a black and white war film telling the story of the defence of Malta in 1942 when Spitfires were the island 's main defence from air attacks . Reach for the Sky ( 1956 ) starring Kenneth More tells the story of Douglas Bader , using contemporary Spitfire aircraft in the production . Battle of Britain ( 1969 ) directed by Guy Hamilton and starring Laurence Olivier , Michael Caine , Christopher Plummer , Ralph Richardson , Michael Redgrave , Susannah York and many others . Set in 1940 , this film features several sequences involving a total of 12 flying Spitfires ( mostly Mk IX versions ) , as well as a number of other flying examples of Second World War-era British and German aircraft . Eagles Over London ( 1969 ) , a wholly fictional Italian film , features Spitfires in a recreation of the Battle of Britain . Piece of Cake ( 1987 ) starring Tom Burlinson . Aired on the ITV network in 1987 . Based on the novel by Derek Robinson , the six-part miniseries covered the prewar era to \" Battle of Britain Day , \" 15 September 1940 . The series depicted air combat over the skies of France and Britain during the early stages of the Second World War , though using five flying examples of late model Spitfires in place of the novel 's early model Hurricanes . There were shots of Spitfires taking off and landing together from grass airstrips . Dark Blue World ( 2001 ) , starring Ond\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd was a tale of two Czech pilots who escape Nazi-occupied Europe to fly Spitfires during the Battle of Britain . Jan Sv\u011br\u00e1k filmed some new aerial scenes and reused aerial footage from Hamilton 's film . James May 's Toy Stories ( 2009 ) , starring James May was a BBC TV series which featured an episode in which children constructed a 1 : 1 scale model of the Spitfire in the style of the Airfix 1 / 72 scale model first released in 1953 . Doctor Who \u2013 \" Victory of the Daleks \" ( 2010 ) , was an episode of a popular BBC TV series in which three Spitfires modified for spaceflight aid in defending London from alien Daleks during the Blitz . Inform-Educate-Entertain ( 2013 ) , the debut album by alternative British band Public Service Broadcasting ( band ) features the single ' Spitfire ' in which the design and construction of the plane are described through various samples to the backing of the song itself . Guy Martin 's Spitfire ( 2014 ) was a Channel 4 documentary covering the two-year restoration of a Mark 1 Spitfire , N3200 , coded ' QV ' , that had been buried beneath the sand for 46 years after crash landing on a French beach during the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 . Guy Martin tells the Boy 's Own-style story of its pilot , Squadron Leader Geoffrey Stephenson and helps in the restoration of the aircraft . = = Specifications ( Spitfire Mk VB ) = = The Spitfire 's performance improved greatly as WWII progressed , for more information see Supermarine Spitfire variants : specifications , performance and armament .

                    "text": "No. 72 Wing RAAF = No. 72 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) wing that operated during World War II . It was formed in April 1943 at Townsville , Queensland , as part of North-Eastern Area Command . Led by Group Captain Charles Eaton , the wing soon deployed to Merauke , Dutch New Guinea , where it comprised three squadrons flying CAC Boomerang and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters , and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers . Eaton was succeeded by Group Captain Allan Walters in mid-1943 . No. 72 Wing took part in the defence of Torres Strait , undertaking interception , patrol and occasional ground-attack and anti-shipping duties . By July 1944 , its original squadrons had all been disbanded or transferred to other operational formations . No. 120 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron , which had arrived in May 1944 , operating Kittyhawks , remained at Merauke until February 1945 . The wing headquarters returned to Australia that May , and disbanded the following month . = = History = = No. 72 Wing was formed on 23 April 1943 at Townsville , Queensland , under the command of Group Captain Charles Eaton . Early the next month , its headquarters deployed to Merauke , described by the official history of the RAAF in World War II as \" a desolate marshy little port in Dutch New Guinea \" . Controlling No. 84 Squadron ( flying CAC Boomerang fighters ) , No. 86 Squadron ( P-40 Kittyhawk fighters ) , and No. 12 Squadron ( A-31 Vengeance dive bombers ) , the wing 's purpose was to assist in the defence of Torres Strait . The Boomerangs , operating out of Horn Island , undertook air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea , first making contact with enemy forces on 16 May 1943 ; they exchanged fire with three Japanese bombers , but the latter escaped into cloud . Merauke airfield was only completed in late June , and Nos. 86 and 12 Squadrons began arriving early the next month ; by then the wing had also acquired No. 44 Operational Base Unit and its own medical receiving station and mobile fighter sector headquarters . Eaton 's relations with North-Eastern Area Command in Townsville had meanwhile became strained . In his opinion , \" the problems of Merauke were not understood from there ... mountains were made out of molehills \" , and he was posted that July to lead a bombing and gunnery establishment in South Australia . Later in the year he would form No. 79 Wing at Batchelor , Northern Territory . Group Captain Allan Walters , formerly in charge of No. 1 ( Fighter ) Wing in Darwin , assumed command of No. 72 Wing following Eaton 's reassignment . Enemy contact was generally sporadic and inconclusive , but on 9 September 1943 a force of over thirty Japanese bombers and escorting fighters heading for Merauke were intercepted by fourteen of No. 72 Wing 's Kittyhawks and four of its Boomerangs ; although most of the Kittyhawks ' guns failed to fire through oil clogging , and none of the Boomerangs made contact , the Australian aircraft claimed one bomber and two fighters destroyed without loss . No. 12 Squadron became fully operational at Merauke in September , but was mainly given patrol duty and only rarely saw enemy activity . The following month , No. 84 Squadron converted to Kittyhawks and transferred to a new formation , No. 75 Wing , which controlled units on Horn Island , Thursday Island and Higgins Field . During late 1943 and early 1944 , No. 86 Squadron was actively engaged in air defence , enjoying some success against Japanese bombers and their escorts , as well as participating in attacks on infrastructure and shipping in Dutch New Guinea . No. 86 Squadron departed Merauke on 25 April 1944 ; the squadron was subsequently reduced to a cadre and its Kittyhawks transferred to Nos. 78 and 81 Wings of No. 10 Operational Group on Noemfoor Island . It was replaced by the Dutch-Australian No. 120 Squadron , which arrived from Canberra in early May and became operational on the 9th of the month . The same month , Walters handed over command of the wing to Group Captain Bill Hely . In July , No. 12 Squadron was withdrawn to Strathpine , Queensland , where it was reduced to cadre status ahead of converting to B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and eventually serving with another new formation , No. 85 Wing . Hely departed in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation , No. 84 Wing , at Cairns . Most of the RAAF units at Merauke were redeployed in late 1944 but No. 120 Squadron remained there until February 1945 , when it was declared non-operational . The squadron returned to operational status and departed for eventual service at Biak in April that year . No. 72 Wing headquarters returned to Townsville in May 1945 , disbanding on 20 June .",

                    "text": "Russian battleship Tsesarevich = Tsesarevich ( Russian : \u0426\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 ) was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy , built in France at the end of the 19th century . The ship 's design formed the basis of the Russian-built Borodino-class battleships . She was based at Port Arthur , Manchuria after entering service and fought in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 \u2013 05 . Tsesarevich was the flagship of Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft in the Battle of the Yellow Sea and was interned in Tsingtau after the battle . After the end of the war , the ship was transferred to the Baltic Fleet and helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in mid-1906 . While on a Mediterranean cruise , she helped survivors of the 1908 Messina earthquake . Tsesarevich was not very active during the early part of World War I and her bored sailors joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in early 1917 . Now named Grazhdanin , the ship participated in the Battle of Moon Sound in 1917 , during which she was lightly damaged . The ship seized by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution in late 1917 and decommissioned the following year . Grazhdanin was scrapped in 1924 \u2013 1925 . = = Design and description = = The ship was ordered as part of the \" Programme for the Needs of the Far East \" , authorised by Tsar Nicholas II in 1898 to defend Russia 's newly acquired ice-free port of Port Arthur in Manchuria . Russian shipyards were already at full capacity so the Naval Ministry decided to order ships from abroad . Specifications were issued on 14 June 1898 and a few days later the chief designer of the French shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e proposed a design based on that of the French battleship Jaur\u00e9guiberry . The Naval Technical Committee approved the design with a few changes to which the French readily agreed . The General Admiral , Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich selected the French design over a competing proposal from the Baltic Works . A contract was signed on 20 July 1898 at a cost of 30.28 million francs ( 11.355 million rubles ) for delivery in 42 months . Tsesarevich 's most obvious design feature was her tumblehome hull . This had several advantages because it allowed greater freeboard since the narrow upper decks reduced the structural weight of the vessel 's hull , it increased the field of fire of guns mounted on the sides , and it reduced the ship 's roll in heavy seas . Its great disadvantage was that it reduced buoyancy and stability which contributed to excessive heel during turns . During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904 , Imperial Japanese Navy observers thought the Tsesarevich was going to capsize when she suddenly turned out of the battleline . Tsesarevich was 118.5 metres ( 388 ft 9 in ) long overall , had a beam of 23.2 metres ( 76 ft 1 in ) and a draught of 7.92 metres ( 26 ft 0 in ) . The ship displaced 13,105 tonnes ( 12,898 long tons ) . Her crew consisted of 28 \u2013 29 officers and 750 enlisted men . The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers at a working pressure of 19 kg / cm2 ( 1,863 kPa ; 270 psi ) . The boilers were fitted with economizers that preheated their feed water . The engines were rated at 16,300 indicated horsepower ( 12,200 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Tsesarevich handily exceeded her design speed and reached 18.77 knots ( 34.76 km / h ; 21.60 mph ) from 15,254 indicated horsepower ( 11,375 kW ) during her official machinery trials in July \u2013 August 1903 . She normally carried 800 long tons ( 810 t ) of coal , but could carry a maximum of 1,350 long tons ( 1,370 t ) . This allowed the ship to steam for 5,500 nautical miles ( 10,200 km ; 6,300 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Tsesarevich was fitted with six steam-driven generators with a total capacity of 550 kilowatts ( 740 hp ) . = = = Armament and fire control = = = Tsesarevich 's main armament consisted of two pairs of 40-calibre 12-inch guns mounted in center-pivot , electrically powered , twin-gun turrets fore and aft . The guns and their mountings were Russian-built , but the turrets themselves were made in France . The guns could be loaded at all angles of elevation and the turrets could traverse 270 \u00b0 . Trials revealed that the ammunition hoists tended to jam when the ship was rolling ; the shipyard shipped new hoists to Port Arthur because the Russians wanted the ship in the Far East as soon as possible and they were installed in January 1904 . 70 rounds per gun were carried . The guns fired one shell every 90 \u2013 132 seconds . They fired a 731.3-pound ( 331.7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,598 ft / s ( 792 m / s ) to a range of 16,010 yards ( 14,640 m ) at an elevation of 15 \u00b0 . The secondary armament of the ships consisted of a dozen 45-caliber Canet Model 1892 6-inch ( 150 mm ) ( QF ) guns mounted in six electrically powered twin-gun turrets on the upper deck . The corner turrets had an 150 \u00b0 arc of fire and the center turrets could cover 180 \u00b0 . Each six-inch gun was provided with 200 rounds . Their rate of fire was 2 \u2013 4 rounds per minute . They fired shells that weighed 91 lb ( 41.4 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2,600 ft / s ( 792.5 m / s ) . They had a maximum range of approximately 12,600 yards ( 11,500 m ) . A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included twenty 50-calibre Canet QF 75-millimetre ( 3.0 in ) guns ; 14 in hull embrasures and the remaining six mounted on the superstructure . The ship carried 300 shells for each gun . They fired a 11-pound ( 4.9 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,700 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) to a maximum range of 7,005 yards ( 6,405 m ) at an elevation of 13 \u00b0 . Tsesarevich also mounted twenty 47-millimetre ( 1.9 in ) Hotchkiss guns in the superstructure . They fired a 2.2-pound ( 1.00 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1,400 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) at a rate of around 15 rounds per minute . Eight smaller 37-millimetre ( 1.5 in ) Hotchkiss guns were also fitted , but their locations are unknown . The ship carried four 381-millimetre ( 15.0 in ) torpedo tubes ; two of these were mounted above water in the bow and stern , and the two broadside underwater tubes were located near the forward 12-inch magazine . Tsesarevich carried a total of 14 torpedoes . The ship also carried 45 mines to be laid to protect her anchorage in remote areas . The ship was fitted with two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images that had to be superimposed to derive the range . The gunnery officer then calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target and transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each turret . = = = Protection = = = Tsesarevich used the latest Krupp armor in a version of the French cellular armor scheme . This consisted of a full-length waterline armoured belt with armored decks above and below . Behind the belt were well-subdivided compartments mostly used to store coal . This was intended to keep the ship afloat regardless of the damage inflicted above the upper armoured deck . The waterline armor belt was 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) high , with 1.5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) below the waterline at normal load . It had a maximum thickness of 250 millimetres ( 9.8 in ) for a length of 60 metres ( 196 ft 10 in ) amidships which gradually reduced to a thickness of 180 millimetres ( 7.1 in ) at the bow and 170 millimetres ( 6.7 in ) at the stern . The belt tapered to a thickness of 170 millimetres at its bottom edge amidships and presumably tapered proportionally along its length . Above the waterline belt was an upper strake of armour that was 1.67 metres ( 5 ft 6 in ) high and had a maximum thickness of 200 millimetres ( 7.9 in ) . It was slightly shorter than the waterline belt and similarly reduced in thickness towards the ends of the ship . Forward it consisted of 120-millimetre ( 4.7 in ) armour plates and 130 millimetres ( 5.1 in ) aft . The armor of the main gun turrets and their supporting tubes was 250 millimetres thick with roofs 63 millimetres ( 2.5 in ) thick . Below the upper armour deck the armour of the support tubes decreased to 100 millimetres ( 3.9 in ) . The turrets of the secondary armament had 150-millimetre ( 5.9 in ) sides with 30 millimetres ( 1.2 in ) roofs . The sides of the conning tower were 254 millimetres ( 10.0 in ) thick and it had a 63-millimetre roof . It had a communications tube that extended down to the upper armoured deck that was protected by 100-millimetre armour . The funnel uptakes were protected by 19 millimetres ( 0.7 in ) of armour for the height of one deck above the upper armoured deck . Above the upper armour belt there was a deck that ran the full length of the ship that consisted of a 50-millimetre ( 2.0 in ) armour plate laid on 10-millimetre ( 0.39 in ) deck plating . At the top of the waterline belt was two layers of 20-millimetre ( 0.79 in ) armour . It also extended the full length of the ship , but not the full width ; it curved downward behind the belt and was connected to the lower edge of the belt by a 20-millimetre plate . It continued downward to the ship 's inner bottom plates and formed a sort of torpedo bulkhead . This bulkhead was 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) from the side of the ship and extended for a length of 84 metres ( 275 ft 7 in ) . It was backed with coal bunkers . = = Construction and service = = Construction began on Tsesarevich , named after the title of the heir to the Russian throne , on 18 May 1899 at the Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e shipyard in La Seyne-sur-Mer , France . The ship was laid down on 8 July 1899 and launched on 23 February 1901 . Construction was supervised by Captain Ivan Grigorovich , who became the ship 's first captain . Tsesarevich entered service in August 1903 and was assigned to the Far East . She arrived in Port Arthur on 2 December 1903 . Upon completion , the Tsesarevich was the Russian Navy 's best battleship at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War . = = = Russo-Japanese War = = = She was one of three ships to be struck by Japanese torpedoes during the surprise attack on Port Arthur during the night of 8 / 9 February 1904 . Tsesarevich was hit abaft the portside torpedo bulkhead and the ship took on an 18 \u00b0 list that was partially corrected by counterflooding compartments on the starboard side . She got underway , but ran aground at the narrow harbor entrance . She was refloated and moved into the harbour for repairs that lasted until 7 June . Some of the ship 's guns were removed during the summer to reinforce the defenses of the port . Tsesarevich lost a total of four 75-millimeter , two 47-millimeter and two 37-millimeter guns . The ship was hit twice on 7 August by Japanese 4.7-inch ( 120 mm ) shells fired at long range ; a fragment from one of them lightly wounded Vitgeft . On the morning of 10 August 1904 , the First Pacific Squadron sortied from Port Arthur in an attempt to break through the Japanese fleet blockading the port and reach Vladivostok . The Russian squadron consisted of six battleships , Tsesarevich , Retvizan , Pobeda , Peresvet , Sevastopol and Poltava , along with four protected cruisers and eight destroyers . The Japanese fleet , commanded by Admiral Togo , was comprised four battleships , Mikasa , Asahi , Fuji , Shikishima , two armoured cruisers Nishin and Kasuga , as well as seven protected cruisers . Tsesarevich and Pobeda both suffered mechanical problems within an hour of departure that forced the fleet to slow down to a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . Togo failed in his attempt to cross the Russian 's T after spotting them around 12 : 25 and a general engagement began around 13 : 25 with the Japanese ships concentrating their fire on Tsesarevich and Retvizan , but the effective Russian fire forced Togo to disengage around 15 : 20 . He closed with the Russians about two hours later and opened fire at 17 : 35 . Neither side was able to mortally damage any ships while the Russians were still in the lead with about a half-hour of daylight left when two 12-inch shells fired by Asahi struck near Tsesarevich 's conning tower at 18 : 40 . Shell fragments bounced off the conning tower 's overhanging roof into the conning tower , killing Vitgeft , two staff officers and the helmsman . The ship turned to port with the steering wheel jammed and was followed by several other battleships . Tsesarevich became the focus of attention from every Japanese ship so the captain of Retvizan decided to charge the Japanese battleline to buy time for Tsesarevich to fix her steering problem . He succeeded in doing so and the squadron 's second-in-command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky gradually asserted command over the scattered Russian ships and ordered them back to Port Arthur in the darkness . Tsesarevich attempted to head north to Vladivostok in the dark , but her damaged funnels greatly increased her coal consumption and reduced her speed to only 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6.9 mph ) so that she was forced to head for the German treaty port of Tsingtau instead with three destroyers for escort . Upon arrival the following day , Tsesarevich and her companions were interned and disarmed . The ship had been hit by thirteen 12-inch and two 8-inch ( 200 mm ) shells that killed 12 and wounded 47 members of her crew . = = = Post Russo-Japanese War and WWI = = = At the end of the Russo-Japanese war , the ship was transferred to the Baltic in early 1906 and helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion later that year . Around 1906 , her fighting top was removed and her superstructure was cut down . The 75 mm guns in the superstructure were apparently removed as well . Tsesarevich made regular winter cruises to the Mediterranean before World War I and aided survivors of the Messina earthquake in December 1908 . In 1909 \u2013 10 the ship 's machinery was overhauled and her amidships casemated 75 mm guns were removed and plated over four years later . Tsesarevich was not very active during the early part of World War I and she reportedly received two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns during the war . Because of her inactivity her bored sailors joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in early 1917 . She was renamed Grazhdanin ( Russian : \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d ( meaning Citizen ) ) on 13 April 1917 after the February Revolution . The ship took part in the Battle of Moon Sound in October 1917 . During the climatic part of the battle , Grazhdanin engaged the German minesweepers on 17 October with little effect while Slava engaged the German dreadnoughts K\u00f6nig and Kronprinz . The latter fired at Grazhdanin and hit her twice , killing one and wounding four crewmen , although neither hit caused significant damage . The German dreadnoughts outranged Grazhdanin , and she was forced to retreat and abandon Moon Sound in the face of German pressure . By December the ship was in Kronstadt , where she came under the control of the Bolsheviks , and she was hulked there in May 1918 . Grazhdanin was scrapped beginning in 1924 , although she was not officially stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925 .",

                    "text": "Rochus Misch = Rochus Misch ( 29 July 1917 \u2013 5 September 2013 ) was a German Oberscharf\u00fchrer ( sergeant ) in the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ( LSSAH ) . He was badly wounded during the Polish campaign during the first month of World War II in Europe . After recovering , from 1940 to April 1945 , he served in the F\u00fchrerbegleitkommando ( F\u00fchrer Escort Command ; FBK ) as a bodyguard , courier , and telephone operator for German dictator Adolf Hitler . He was widely reported in the media as being the last surviving occupant of the F\u00fchrerbunker when he died in September 2013 . = = Early life = = Rochus Misch was born on 29 July 1917 in Alt-Schalkowitz near Oppeln ( Opole ) in the Province of Silesia ( now Stare Sio\u0142kowice , Poland ) . His father , a construction worker , died of wounds sustained in World War I. His widowed mother died of pneumonia when he was two and a half , and he grew up with his grandparents . His older brother Bruno died after a swimming accident in May 1922 . Over the objections of the school director , his grandfather took him out of school after eight years as he thought Rochus needed to learn a trade . After several years , Misch moved to Hoyerswerda and became an apprentice with the firm of Schm\u00fcller & Model . There he trained as a painter . In 1935 , after working as a journeyman painter , Misch attended the Masters ' School for Fine Arts in Cologne . After six months , he returned to Hoyerswerda to continue his training . Misch met Gerda , his wife-to-be , in July 1938 . They later married on New Year 's Eve , 1942 . They had a daughter , Brigitta Jacob-Engelken who after the war supported Jewish causes . = = Military service = = In 1937 , Misch received a call up notice for military service . In Offenberg , he joined the SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe ( SS-VT ) , the predecessor to the Waffen-SS , instead of the German Army as the SS-VT did not require Reichsarbeitsdienst ( National Labour Service ) time . Along with eleven others , he was selected for Hitler 's personal bodyguard unit , the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ( LSSAH ) . In August 1939 , he was promoted to the rank of SS-Rottenf\u00fchrer . = = = World War II = = = For the invasion of Poland in September 1939 , his regiment was attached to the XIII Army Corps , a part of the 8th Army . Near Warsaw on 24 September , he was one of four men selected by his company commander , then SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Wilhelm Mohnke to negotiate the surrender of Polish troops during the Battle of Modlin . He was picked because of his ability , although very limited , to speak Polish . After the negotiations failed , the Germans headed back to their lines . When they were about 80 metres from the fort , firing began . Several rounds hit Misch , who then fell down and lost consciousness . Some German soldiers carried him to an aid station . Later , he was transferred to two different hospitals . Thereafter , he spent six weeks at a convalescent home . For his actions , Misch was awarded the Iron Cross , Second Class . As Misch was the last living member of his Lower Silesian family , Mohnke recommended him for the F\u00fchrerbegleitkommando ( F\u00fchrer Escort Command ; FBK ) . This was made up of SS members , including men from the LSSAH , who no longer had to serve on the front lines . Misch was transferred to the FBK in early May 1940 . As a junior member of Hitler 's permanent bodyguard , Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war . When not serving as bodyguards , Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators , couriers , orderlies , valets , and waiters . When on duty , the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him . They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler . It did cause Misch some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols . On 16 January 1945 , following the Wehrmacht 's defeat in the Battle of the Bulge , Misch and the rest of Hitler 's personal staff moved into the F\u00fchrerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin . His FBK commanding officer , Franz Sch\u00e4dle , appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator . Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker . He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945 . On 22 April 1945 , Sch\u00e4dle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin . Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft . However , his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin . Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery , Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin . By that date , as the Red Army was entering Berlin , propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker . Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch 's telephone exchange in the lower level of the F\u00fchrerbunker . The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch 's post . On 30 April , the Soviets were less than 500 metres ( 1,600 ft ) from the bunker . That afternoon , Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married . Misch witnessed the discovery of the bodies of Hitler and Braun . He followed Otto G\u00fcnsche and Hitler 's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler 's private room . After the door was opened , Misch only took a quick \" glance \" . He saw Eva , with her legs drawn up , to Hitler 's left on the sofa . Her eyes were open and she was dead . Hitler was also dead . He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it ; his head \" had fallen forward slightly \" . Misch started to leave to report the events to Sch\u00e4dle , but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler 's study . By then Misch observed that Hitler 's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket . Several men then picked it up and carried it past him . Misch left and reported the events to Sch\u00e4dle , who instructed him to return to his duty station . After returning to the telephone exchange , Misch later recalled Unterscharf\u00fchrer Retzbach proclaiming \" So they 're burning the boss now ! \" Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events , but Misch declined to go . Thereafter , G\u00fcnsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery . Misch was present in the bunker complex when Magda Goebbels poisoned her six children and then committed suicide with her husband Joseph on 1 May 1945 . According to Misch , this act by the Goebbels ' of murdering their children was most unsettling . Years later he stated that event was the \" most dreadful thing \" he experienced in the bunker . Prior to his suicide , Joseph Goebbels finally released Misch from further service ; he was free to leave . Misch and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker . They exchanged letters to their wives in case anything happened to either of them . Misch then went upstairs through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Sch\u00e4dle had his office to report one last time . According to Hentschel , by that time Sch\u00e4dle 's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous . Misch told Sch\u00e4dle that Goebbels had released him . Sch\u00e4dle told Misch of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area . After helping Misch , Sch\u00e4dle shot himself . Misch fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May , only hours before the Red Army seized it . He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels . However , they were captured shortly thereafter and taken prisoner . Misch was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow , where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler 's last days . Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler 's fate and theories about possible escape . Misch spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps . = = Later life = = After his release from captivity in 1953 , Misch returned to what was then West Berlin . He arrived home on New Year 's Eve 1953 to the house which was 3.2 kilometres ( 2.0 mi ) from the F\u00fchrerbunker . At the time , Misch 's wife worked as a teacher in Neuk\u00f6lln . Misch struggled for several years with what to do with his life after captivity . He was offered various odd jobs , among others as a porter in a hospital and as a driver . Most of these job offers were through his wartime contacts , and required moving away from Berlin , which his wife refused to do . He finally obtained a loan backed by wealthy German philanthropists to buy out a painting and interior decorating shop from a retiree in Berlin . He ran this modest business successfully , and during the early Allied occupation of Berlin also became involved in the making of peanut butter for American troops . The business had been started by Misch 's old friend , Adolf Kleinholdermann . This sideline business became so successful that Misch considered leaving his shop . His wife convinced him to remain in the painting and interior decorating business . In 1975 , Gerda was elected to the parliament of West Berlin in which she served for several years . Years later Gerda developed Alzheimer 's and died in 1998 . Misch continued to manage his shop until his retirement at age 68 in 1985 . His memoir in German , Der letzte Zeuge ( The Last Witness ) , was published in 2008 . The English edition was published in 2014 with an introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse . With the deaths of Bernd von Freytag-Loringhoven on 27 February 2007 , Armin Lehmann on 10 October 2008 , and Siegfried Knappe on 1 December 2008 , Misch was said to be the last survivor of the F\u00fchrerbunker . Misch was loyal to Hitler to the end , stating in Nazi apologia , \" He was no brute . He was no monster . He was no superman \" , \" ... very normal . Not like what is written \" , and \" [ h ] e was a wonderful boss \" . Misch 's daughter , Brigitta , learned through her maternal grandmother that Gerda was of Jewish descent . However , Gerda never mentioned it and her father refused to acknowledge it . Brigitta became an architect and has supported Jewish causes . After the release of the 2004 German film Downfall ( Der Untergang ) in France , French journalist Nicolas Bourcier interviewed Misch on multiple occasions during 2005 . The resulting biography was published in French as J '\u00e9tais garde du corps d 'Hitler 1940 \u2013 1945 ( I was Hitler 's bodyguard 1940 \u2013 1945 ) in March 2006 , ISBN 2253121541 . Translations were released in South America , Japan , Spain , Poland , Turkey , and Germany in 2006 and 2007 . Misch served as consultant to writer Christopher McQuarrie on the 2008 film Valkyrie , a Hollywood depiction of the 20 July plot . Misch lived in Berlin in the same house he moved into when he was released by the Soviets . The house is in the district of Rudow in South Berlin . Misch regularly received visitors who wished to speak to or interview him .

                    "text": "1970 Canada hurricane = The 1970 Canada hurricane was an unnamed tropical cyclone that brought impact to Bermuda and Newfoundland . The fourth hurricane and ninth tropical storm of the annual hurricane season , this system developed northeast of the Bahamas as a subtropical depression on October 12 . While tracking northeastward , the system intensified , becoming a subtropical storm on the following day . The subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone on October 16 , and strengthened into a hurricane about twelve hours later . The hurricane later bypassed Bermuda , before further intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir \u2013 Simpson hurricane wind scale . Thereafter , the hurricane accelerated rapidly northeastward , and made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as a Category 1 hurricane . It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on October 17 . The system produced tropical storm force winds on Bermuda , which caused the suspension of schools , transportation , and interrupted businesses , although minimal structural damage occurred . Light rainfall was also reported on the island . Hurricane force winds were observed throughout Newfoundland , which caused damage to structures , though mostly limited to broken windows . Rough seas damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp on the Atlantic coast of the island . The cost of damage on the Burin Peninsula was estimated to be in the thousands of dollars , although the specific figure in unknown . Heavy rainfall was also reported in the region , with precipitation in Quebec reaching nearly 5 inches ( 130 mm ) . On the French Territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , several buildings and houses lost their roof due to strong winds . = = Meteorological history = = On October 11 , 1970 , satellite images indicated that a tropical depression developed north of Hispaniola . However , according to post-analysis , a subtropical depression actually formed on October 12 at 1200 UTC . The depression slowly intensified over the next few days , and became a subtropical storm on October 12 , thought this was operationally unnoticed by the National Hurricane Center . By October 13 , satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with the depression merged with a weak stationary front . As a result , the National Hurricane Center no longer considered it purely tropical and classified the system as a \" subtropic storm \" on October 14 . Later that day , the National Hurricane Center began issuing special bulletins for the storm , indicating the possibility of the system acquiring tropical characteristics . Early on October 16 , satellite imagery indicated that the storm was developing a cloud pattern typical of a normal tropical cyclone . In addition , Reconnaissance aircraft flight data indicated that a warm core was developing . As a result , the system had acquired enough characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on that day . Later that day , the storm strengthened enough to be upgraded to a hurricane at 1200 UTC . Six hours later , the system passed just west of Bermuda , although winds were well below hurricane force on the island . Spiral cloud bands and an eye feature were observed on radars as the hurricane bypassed the island . The warm core persisted into October 17 , which indicated that the hurricane was fully tropical for at least 30 \u2013 36 hours . Early on October 17 , the National Hurricane Center discontinued bulletins on the system , while it was located about 150 miles ( 240 km ) northeast of Bermuda . At 0600 UTC on October 17 , the system intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir \u2013 Simpson hurricane wind scale . Six hours later , the hurricane attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 974 mbar ( 28.8 inHg ) . Although a radio bulletin by the Naval Communications Station Washington , D.C. Transmitter ( NSS ) at 1200 UTC noted that it had hurricane characteristics , the National Hurricane Center did not name the storm . By 1800 UTC , a cold front began impacting the circulation of the hurricane , which caused the storm to weaken back to a Category 1 hurricane , and began losing its tropical characteristics . At approximately 2330 UTC on October 17 , the hurricane made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Only 30 minutes later , the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The remnant extratropical cyclone curved abruptly northward and later re-emerged into the Atlantic , before dissipating on October 20 . = = Impact = = Late on October 16 , the storm passed close to Bermuda as a minimal Category 1 hurricane , causing strong winds on the island . Maximum sustained winds of 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) and gusts up to 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) were recorded . At an elevated location , an anemometer reported sustained winds as high as 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . Strong winds caused the suspension of school , transportation , and disruption to businesses across Bermuda . A riot started by the recurrence of vandalism and arson plagued the island for two weeks leading up to the storm . However , merchants and police were forced to ease their anti-riot efforts to board up their windows . In addition to high winds , the storm also produced light rainfall on the island of Bermuda , which peaked at 1.68 inches ( 43 mm ) . Shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone , the hurricane moved across the extreme southeastern portion of Newfoundland at Category 1 intensity . As a result , high winds were reported across the region ; wind speeds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) occurred on the Burin Peninsula . Wind damage occurred throughout the island , although mostly limited to broken windows , trees being uprooted , and fences knocked over . In addition , a house under construction blew over in Marystown ; another house was abandoned in St. John 's for the fear of the roof blowing off . Hydro poles also caught fire in Burin and Grand Banks . Rough seas caused by the storm sunk or damage several fishing dories in Grand Bank and three fishing premises were washed away in Lamaline . In addition , a fishing ramp was washed out to sea in Lourdes Cove . Damage in the Burin Peninsula alone totaled to thousands of dollars , although the exact figure is unknown . Heavy rainfall also occurred across much of the Atlantic Canada region , especially in areas well west of the path of the storm . The highest amount of precipitation from the storm was reported in Quebec , where rainfall peaked at 4.9 inches ( 120 mm ) in the extreme eastern part of the province . Rainfall occurred further north into Labrador , with precipitation of at least 1 inch ( 25 mm ) being reported as far north as Groswater Bay . Further south in the provinces of Prince Edward Island , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick , rainfall amounts did not exceed 4 inches ( 100 mm ) . No flooding was reported in Atlantic Canada . On the offshore French Territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , severe wind damage was also reported on Saint-Pierre . Several homes and a church lost its roof .",

                    "text": "On the Day Before = \" On the Day Before \" is the forty-eighth The West Wing episode and fourth of the third season . It originally aired on NBC October 31 , 2001 . The episode deals with a suicide bomber in Jerusalem , as well as continued negotiations over the estate tax . Written by Aaron Sorkin , Paul Redford , and Nanda Chitre , and directed by Christopher Misiano , the episode contains the first appearances by H. Richard Greene as Congressman Robert Royce and Thomas Kopache as Assistant Secretary of State Bob \" Bobby \" Slatterly . There are also guest appearances by Kevin Tighe , Cliff DeYoung and Mary Mara . Janel Moloney was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance in this episode . = = Plot = = The White House is hosting a dinner for Nobel laureates but the staff keep getting interrupted by various domestic and international crises . As President Bartlet vetoes the bill to repeal the estate tax , it appears that the Republican Party might have the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto . A representative of the dissenting Democrats is brought in to negotiate a deal with Toby and Sam . Meanwhile , Josh is meeting with Indiana Governor Jack Buckland ( Tighe ) to talk him out of a potential primary challenge against Bartlet . Leo is at this point getting exasperated by their own partisans taking advantage of the administration 's weakness due to the impending hearings over the president 's concealment of his MS. He tells Josh to \" throw an elbow \" and threaten to leak the fact that Buckland tried to blackmail the president . In the end , Josh ends up striking a compromise , while it is Toby and Sam who \" throw an elbow \" by turning down Democratic Congressman Kimble and offering the same deal to moderate Republican Congressman Robert Royce instead . A Palestinian suicide bomber in Jerusalem causes the death of several Israelis , as well as two American nationals . National Security Advisor Nancy McNally and Leo consider the potential implications of possible retributions and are relieved when the Palestinians respond to American pressure by arresting a leader of a militant group . As Leo points out , however , the solution is likely to be only temporary . Other staff members have their own problems to deal with . Charlie has been offered immunity from the special prosecutors and Leo , among others , suggests he take it . Charlie , however , insists that he will \" stay with [ his ] team \" . Donna , who in the previous episode ( \" Ways and Means \" ) went on a date with a Republican congressional aide involved in the investigation , comes clean with Josh . It turns out she met him not only once , but also on another occasion after she had found out what position he held , and Josh is not pleased . C.J. is provoked by an inexperienced lifestyle reporter , Sherri Wexler ( Mara ) , trying to put her in a bad light and responds by embarrassing her in front of a full press room . = = Production = = The West Wing episodes were written close to production and at the time of the September 11 attacks Sorkin was writing on episode six of the season ( \" Gone Quiet \" ) , which originally was to air on Halloween ( October 31 ) . The events caused consternation in the writing staff , and the episode had to be entirely rewritten . \" I was kind of paralyzed , \" said Sorkin , \" I didn 't know what to write \" . Because of the attacks , air dates were postponed and the already finished \" On the Day Before \" became the Halloween episode instead . Nevertheless , the episode took on greater relevance to actual , international events than the writers had intended . On August 9 , after the actors had just done a cold reading of the episode , they were informed about the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing , a Jerusalem suicide bombing in which an American was killed . The close similarity to an event in the script came as a shock to the actors . \" It was mind-blowing , \" said Richard Schiff ( Toby ) . = = Social and cultural references = = The title of this episode refers to a conversation that the President has with his staff towards the end of the episode . In it , he tells his staff that at a White House dinner , someone told him that on Yom Kippur Jews ask God for forgiveness , but \" on the day before \" Yom Kippur , called Erev Yom Kippur , Jews ask forgiveness from one another . The president remarks that \" you can 't ask forgiveness of God until you 've asked forgiveness of people on the day before . \" In a reference to the Palestinian leadership , Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat is mentioned by name . Even though foreign dignitaries were normally fictional on the show , producer Aaron Sorkin said it felt right to call the Chairman by his real name \" ' cause Arafat 's been around forever and he 'll be around forever \" . In a later episode , however ( \" Gaza \" in season five ) , the name of the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was changed to Nizar Farad , a fictional character . By that point in mid-2004 , Arafat was in failing health in real life , and would die in November 2004 . The show continued to use the Farad character and never made any references to Arafat 's successor Mahmoud Abbas . When the president vetoes the bill , it is said that this is Bartlet 's first veto . In a previous episode , \" In This White House \" as Sam debates Ainsley Hayes for the first time , it is made clear that the president has in fact previously vetoed a bill . It has been suggested , however , that what was discussed on that occasion was a pocket veto . At one point in the episode , Josh quotes an interview with one of Buckland 's aides in what he calls the Indianapolis Post-Dispatch . No such newspaper exists . The show chose to combine the names of two different newspapers : the Indianapolis Star , and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . = = Reception = = It was for this episode , along with \" War Crimes \" , that Janel Moloney was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2002 . In this category she was up against two of her co-stars : Mary-Louise Parker and Stockard Channing , who went on to win the award . Deborah of Television Without Pity gave the episode a grade of \" A \" .",

After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and meeting his longtime girlfriend , English actress Kate Fahy , in 1974 , he began his career as a stage actor in the 1970s . His work in theatre , including an award-winning performance in the title role of the Royal Court Theatre 's Hamlet , led to several supporting roles in film and television . He made his breakthrough screen performance in Terry Gilliam 's 1985 cult film Brazil . Critically lauded for his versatility , Pryce has participated in big-budget films including Evita , Tomorrow Never Dies , Pirates of the Caribbean , The New World , GI Joe : The Rise of Cobra , GI Joe : Retaliation as well as independent films including Glengarry Glen Ross and Carrington . His career in theatre has also been prolific , and he has won two Tony Awards \u2014 the first in 1977 for his Broadway debut in Comedians , the second for his 1991 role as The Engineer in the musical Miss Saigon . Beginning in 2015 , Pryce became a guest actor on the HBO series Game of Thrones as the High Sparrow before being upgraded to a regular cast member in 2016 . = = Early life = = Born John Price in Carmel , Flintshire , he is the son of Margaret Ellen ( n\u00e9e Williams ) and Isaac Price , a former coal miner who , along with his wife , ran a small general grocery shop . Price has two older sisters . He was educated at Holywell Grammar School ( today Holywell High School ) , and , at the age of 16 , he went to art college and then started training to be a teacher at Edge Hill College ( now Edge Hill University ) in Ormskirk . While studying , he took part in a college theatre production . When he joined Equity , the British actors ' trade union , he used Jonathan Pryce as a stage name because Equity can only have one actor with any particular name on its books . An impressed tutor suggested he became an actor and on Pryce 's behalf sent off to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for an application form , and Pryce was awarded a scholarship to RADA . While at RADA Pryce worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings . Pryce was part of ' new wave ' of actors to emerge from the Academy . Others included Bruce Payne , Juliet Stevenson , Alan Rickman , Anton Lesser , Kenneth Branagh and Fiona Shaw . Despite finding RADA \" straight-laced \" , and being told by his tutor that he could never aspire to do more than playing villains in Z-Cars , when he graduated he joined the Everyman Theatre Liverpool Company , eventually becoming the theatre 's Artistic Director and went on to perform with the Royal Shakespeare Company and at the Nottingham Playhouse . To gain his Equity card to work in Liverpool , he made his first screen appearance in a minor role on a 1972 episode of the British science fiction programme Doomwatch , called \" Fire & Brimstone \" . He then starred in two television films , both directed by Stephen Frears , Daft as a Brush and Playthings . After the Everyman , Pryce joined the director Sir Richard Eyre at the Nottingham Playhouse and starred in the Trevor Griffiths play Comedians in a role specially written for his talents , Gethin Price . The production then transferred to London 's Old Vic Theatre and in 1976 he reprised the role on Broadway , this time directed by Mike Nichols , for which he won the 1977 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play , his first Tony Award . It was around this time that he appeared in his first movie role , playing the character Joseph Manasse in the film drama Voyage of the Damned , starring Faye Dunaway . He did not , however , abandon the stage , appearing from 1978 to 1979 in the Royal Shakespeare Company 's productions of The Taming of the Shrew as Petruchio , and Antony and Cleopatra as Octavius Caesar . = = Career = = = = = 1980s = = = In 1980 , his performance in the title role of Hamlet at the Royal Court Theatre won him an Olivier Award , and was acclaimed by some critics as the definitive Hamlet of his generation . That year , Pryce had a small but pivotal role as Zarniwoop in the 12th episode of the Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy radio series , one that he reprised for the Quintessential Phase which was broadcast in 2005 . In his original role as Zarniwoop , Pryce 's character questions the \" ruler of the Universe \" , a solipsist who has been chosen to rule arguably because of either his inherent manipulability , or immunity therefrom , on his philosophical opinions . Around the same time , he also appeared in the film Breaking Glass ( 1980 ) . Pryce played the role of the sinister Mr. Dark in Something Wicked This Way Comes ( 1983 ) , based on the Ray Bradbury novel of the same title . After appearing mostly in films , such as the Ian McEwan-scripted The Ploughman 's Lunch , and Martin Luther , Heretic ( both also 1983 ) , he achieved a breakthrough with his role as the subdued protagonist Sam Lowry in the Terry Gilliam film , Brazil ( 1985 ) . After Brazil , Pryce appeared in the historical thriller The Doctor and the Devils ( also 1985 ) and then in the Gene Wilder-directed film Haunted Honeymoon ( 1986 ) . During this period of his life , Pryce continued to perform on stage , and gained particular notice as the successful but self-doubting writer Trigorin in a London production of Anton Chekhov 's The Seagull in late 1985 . From 1986 to 1987 Pryce played the lead part in the Royal Shakespeare Company 's production of Macbeth , which also starred Sin\u00e9ad Cusack as Lady Macbeth . Also in 1986 he starred in the film Jumpin ' Jack Flash . Pryce worked once again with Gilliam in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen ( 1988 ) , playing \" The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson \" . The film was a notorious financial fiasco , with production costing more than $ 40 million , when the original budget was $ 23.5 million . The following year Pryce appeared in three of the earliest episodes of the improvisation show Whose Line Is It Anyway ? , alongside Paul Merton and John Sessions , and in Uncle Vanya , again a play by Chekhov , at the Vaudeville Theatre . = = = 1990s = = = After a series of major dramatic roles on stage , including Vanya and Macbeth , Pryce decided he wanted to do musicals after seeing his friend Patti LuPone in the original London production of Les Mis\u00e9rables . He would successfully return to the stage originating the role of The Engineer , a Eurasian pimp , in the West End musical Miss Saigon . His performance was praised in England where he won the Olivier and Variety Club awards , but when the production transferred to Broadway the Actors ' Equity Association ( AEA ) would not allow Pryce to portray The Engineer because , according to their executive secretary , \" [ t ] he casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an affront to the Asian community . \" Cameron Mackintosh , the show 's producer , decided to cancel the $ 10 million New York production because , he said , he would not let the freedom of artistic expression be attacked . Realizing that its decision would result in the loss of many jobs , and after Pryce received much support from the acting community ( both Charlton Heston and John Malkovich threatened to leave the union if Pryce was not allowed to perform ) the AEA decided to make a deal with Mackintosh , allowing Pryce to appear in the production . He would then , in 1991 , win a Tony Award for his performance . Made in the same period , Pryce starred in the ITV mini-series Selling Hitler ( 1991 ) as Gerd Heidemann . Pryce returned to the London stage the following year to star for one night only at the Royal Festival Hall for an AIDS charity alongside Elaine Paige and Lilliane Montivecchi in the 1992 revival of the Federico Fellini-inspired musical Nine . Pryce featured , alongside Kathy Burke and Minnie Driver , in the BBC serial Mr. Wroe 's Virgins ( 1993 ) , directed by Danny Boyle . Pryce played Henry Kravis in the HBO produced made-for-TV movie Barbarians at the Gate ( 1993 ) . He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and for a Golden Globe Award for his role . Also during 1993 , Pryce starred alongside River Phoenix and Judy Davis in the unfinished film Dark Blood , but production had to be shut down when , 11 days short of completion , Phoenix died from a drug overdose . Director George Sluizer , who owns the rights to what has been filmed , has made available some of the raw material , which features Pryce and Phoenix on a field in Utah , on his personal website . Between 1993 and 1997 , Pryce , on a multimillion-dollar contract became the spokesman for the Infiniti automobile marque in a series of American television commercials , in particular for the Infiniti J30 and Infiniti Q45 . In one of these advertisements Pryce appeared alongside jazz singer Nancy Wilson in a Prague nightclub . In 1994 , Pryce portrayed Fagin in a revival of the musical Oliver ! , and starred alongside Emma Thompson in the film Carrington ( 1995 ) , which centres on a platonic relationship between gay writer Lytton Strachey and painter Dora Carrington . For his portrayal of Strachey , Pryce received the Best Actor Award at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival . Pryce then starred with Madonna and Antonio Banderas in his first musical film , Evita ( 1996 ) . In this adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's stage musical , Pryce portrayed the Argentinian president Juan Per\u00f3n . The movie 's soundtrack was an international success . It contains over 30 songs sung mainly by Madonna , Banderas and Pryce , of which two are solos for Pryce : \" She Is A Diamond \" and \" On The Balcony Of The Casa Rosada \" . After Evita , Pryce went on to portray Elliot Carver in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies ( 1997 ) . During the rest of the decade Pryce would play to his new acquired fame as a villain , portraying an Irish terrorist in Ronin ( 1998 ) , a corrupt Cardinal in the controversial Stigmata ( 1999 ) and , for Comic Relief , the Master in the Doctor Who special , Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death . About this time Pryce sang at the Hollywood Bowl alongside opera singer Lesley Garrett in highlights from My Fair Lady and in 1998 , he performed in Cameron Mackintosh 's gala concert Hey , Mr Producer ! , also as Professor Henry Higgins from My Fair Lady and reprising his role as the Engineer from Miss Saigon . = = = 2000s = = = During the early 2000s Pryce starred and participated in a variety of movies , such as The Affair of the Necklace ( 2001 ) , Unconditional Love ( 2002 ) , What a Girl Wants ( 2003 ) , and Terry Gilliam 's aborted project , The Man Who Killed Don Quixote . While the success of some of these films was variable , the 2001 London stage production of My Fair Lady and his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins was acclaimed by observers . This production turned out to be very stressful for Pryce because Martine McCutcheon , who portrayed Eliza Doolittle , was sick during much of the show 's run . McCutcheon was replaced by her understudy Alexandra Jay , who would also fall sick hours before a performance , forcing her understudy , Kerry Ellis , to take the lead . Pryce was understandably upset and on her first night introduced Ellis to the audience before the show by saying \" This will be your first Eliza , my second today and my third this week . Any member of the audience interested in playing Eliza can find applications at the door . Wednesday and Saturday matinee available . \" Pryce ended up dealing with four Elizas during the course of 14 months . Despite the difficulty , the show was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards on 2001 : Best Actress in a Musical for Martine McCutcheon , Outstanding Musical Production , Best Theatre Choreographer and Best Actor in a Musical for Pryce . Pryce lost to Philip Quast , although ironically McCutcheon won in her category having played fewer performances than any of her understudies . Pryce did express interest in doing My Fair Lady in New York , but when asked if he would do it with McCutcheon he said that \" there 's as much chance of me getting a date with Julia Roberts as doing My Fair Lady in New York with Martine McCutcheon . \" In April 2003 Pryce returned to the non-musical stage with A Reckoning , written by American dramatist Wesley Moore . The play co-starred Flora Montgomery and after premiering at the Soho Theatre in London was described by The Daily Telegraph as \" one of the most powerful and provocative new American plays to have opened since David Mamet 's Oleanna . \" Pryce had a role in Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl ( 2003 ) , in which he portrayed a fictional Governor of Jamaica , Weatherby Swann , a film he has described as \" one of those why-not movies . \" After Pirates , Pryce appeared in several large-scale motion pictures , such as De-Lovely ( 2004 ) , his second musical film , a chronicle of the life of songwriter Cole Porter , for which Kevin Kline and Pryce covered a Porter song called \" Blow , Gabriel , Blow \" . The Brothers Grimm ( 2005 ) , Pryce 's third completed film with Terry Gilliam , starred Matt Damon and Heath Ledger , and The New World ( 2005 ) , in which he had a cameo role as King James I.

Pryce 's performance was highly praised , but he lost the Olivier to Richard Griffiths . Pryce lent his voice to the French animated film , Renaissance ( 2006 ) , which he stated he wanted to do because he had never \" done anything quite like it before . \" He reprised the role of Governor Weatherby Swann for the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels , Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest ( 2006 ) and Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End ( 2007 ) . Both were filmed at the same time but released a year apart .

In 2015 he joined the cast of the HBO series Game of Thrones in Season 5 as the High Sparrow .

Her parents met while they were both working in a hotel in their twenties . When she was three years old , her family moved to Germany when her father was hired to manage a hotel there . While living in Germany , Mulligan and her brother attended the International School of D\u00fcsseldorf . When she was eight , she and her family moved back to England . As a teenager , she was educated at Woldingham School in Surrey . Her interest in acting sparked from watching her brother perform in a school production of The King and I when she was six . During his rehearsals , she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play . They let her join the chorus . While enrolled in Woldingham School as teen , she was heavily involved in theatre . She was the student head of the drama department there , performing in plays and musicals , conducting workshops with younger students , and helping put on productions . When Mulligan was 16 , she attended a production of Henry V starring Kenneth Branagh . His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief that she wanted to pursue a career in acting . Mulligan wrote a letter to Branagh 's mail listing asking him for advice . \" I explained that my parents didn 't want me to act , but that I felt it was my vocation in life , \" she said . Kenneth Branagh 's sister wrote back to Mulligan saying , \" Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress , you must be an actress . \" Mulligan 's parents disapproved of her acting ambitions and wished for her to attend a university like her brother . At age 17 , Mulligan applied to three London drama schools , instead of the universities that she was expected to submit an application to , but did not receive a subsequent offer . During Mulligan 's final year at Woldingham School , actor / screenwriter Julian Fellowes delivered a lecture at her school on the production of the film Gosford Park .

Several weeks later , Fellowes 's wife Emma invited Mulligan to a dinner for young , aspiring actors that she and her husband were hosting to offer advice .

It received mixed reviews from critics , having a \" Rotten \" rating with a weighted average of 5.5 / 10 .

At the 2009 MTV Movie Awards , Lautner was nominated for Male Breakthrough Performance , which was won by co-star Robert Pattinson .

Brent Hartinger , a columnist for AfterElton , blasted the magazine , calling the questioning \" unimaginably irresponsible , \" commenting that Lautner was just \" a 17-year old kid \" and that while the rumors were baseless and speculation from certain blogs and fans , it was disappointing that a \" legitimate media outlet \" would print gossip . Hartinger said the magazine reached a \" new low \" and did not have common decency , noting that the line between child and adult \" is there for a good reason \" . Lautner has stated that he does not want to be just known for his looks , as some have attributed his popularity to that and not his actual acting skill .

He stated , \" The script said we were walking into school and Willy takes off his shirt . I said , ' Whoa , whoa , whoa . Time out . He 's gonna take off his shirt in the middle of school ?

You are your own editor , nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you . \" His first professional role , while still in his third and final year at RADA , was in When She Danced at the Globe Theatre in 1991 . He later described the role as \" a big break . One day I was at RADA doing a movement class , the next I was at a read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour . \" Milton Shulman of the Evening Standard praised an \" excellent \" performance while The Observer wrote of \" a notable West End debut \" .

Sheen played the title role in Peer Gynt in 1994 . The Yukio Ninagawa production was staged in Oslo , Tokyo and at the Barbican Centre , London .

Ben Brantley , chief theatre critic for The New York Times , was particularly vocal in his praise . He noted that \" Mr. Sheen elicits a real poetry from the role \" and felt that , while watching him , \" you start to appreciate the derivation of the term star . This actor is so luminous it 's scary ! \" The Independent found him \" quite stunning as Mozart . His fantastically physical performance convinces you of his character 's genius and the play catches fire whenever he 's on stage . \" Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actor . In 1999 , Sheen explored the role of Jimmy Porter in the National Theatre 's production of Look Back in Anger . In 2003 , Sheen described the production as \" the most enjoyable thing I 've ever done ... everything came together \" . The Daily Mail declared him a \" definitive Jimmy Porter ... simply exhilarating in his great jazz riffs of speeches , mercurial and irresistible . \" \" Sheen has cornered the market in explosive energy \" , said The Independent , \" but this thrilling performance is his finest yet . \" The Financial Times noted : \" As Jimmy Porter , a role of staggering difficulty in every way , Michael Sheen gives surely the best performance London has yet seen from him ... You hang on every word he utters ... This is a dazzlingly through-the-body performance . \" He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor . = = = The Deal , The Queen and Fantabulosa ( 2002 \u2013 2006 ) = = = At this point in his career , Sheen began to devote more time to film work . Heartlands , a little-seen 2002 film about a naive man 's road trip in the Midlands , was his first leading film role . While The Guardian dismissed the \" cloying bittersweet-regional-lottery-Britfilm \" , it noted that \" Sheen himself has a childlike , Frank Spencer-ish charm \" . \" It was great to do something that was so different \" , Sheen has said of the role . \" I usually play very extreme characters but I couldn 't get away with doing all my usual silly tricks with Colin . \" Also in 2002 , he had a minor role in the action-adventure film The Four Feathers . In 2003 , Sheen appeared in Bright Young Things , the directorial debut of his Wilde co-star , Stephen Fry . An adaptation of Evelyn Waugh 's novel , the film followed high society partygoers in decadent , pre-war London . Sheen played a gay aristocrat in an ensemble cast which included James McAvoy , Emily Mortimer , David Tennant , Dan Aykroyd , Jim Broadbent and Peter O 'Toole . While the Los Angeles Times said he \" shone \" , The Guardian felt the role \" drastically under-uses his talents \" . Sheen described his character as \" possibly the campest man in cinema history \" and relished a scene \" where I do drugs with [ a then 95-year-old ] Sir John Mills . \" In other 2003 film work , Sheen portrayed the main antagonist , the werewolf leader Lucian , in Underworld and made a brief appearance in the sci-fi film Timeline . Sheen also returned to the stage in 2003 to play the title role in Caligula at the Donmar Warehouse , directed by Michael Grandage . It was the first of just three stage appearances during the 2000s ; his young daughter was now based in Los Angeles , California which made more frequent stage runs in Britain impractical . The Independent 's critic declared it \" one of the most thrilling and searching performances I have ever witnessed \" while The Daily Telegraph described him as an \" outrageously charismatic actor \" with \" an astonishing physical presence \" . The Times praised a \" riveting performance \" while The Guardian found him \" highly impressive ... at one point he attacks his court poet with a single hair-raising leap across a chair and table \" . Sheen won an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor and a Critics ' Circle Theatre Award for Best Actor , and was again nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor . Sheen 's breakthrough role was as British politician Tony Blair in 2003 's The Deal . The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown prior to the 1994 Labour Party leadership election , and was the actor 's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan . Director Stephen Frears cast him because \" he was in Mary Reilly and I knew he was brilliant . \" Filmed while he was playing Caligula nightly on stage , Sheen has remarked , \" It \u2019 s interesting that in searching for monsters to play , you often end up playing leaders . \" The Daily Telegraph praised his \" earnest , yet steely , portrayal \" while The Guardian found him \" excellent . This is intelligent and honest casting . \" In 2004 , Sheen starred in ITV 's Dirty Filthy Love , a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette 's after a marital separation . Sheen spoke of \" treading a fine line \" because \" a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical \" . He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award .

In 2005 , Sheen starred in the National Theatre 's production of The UN Inspector , a David Farr adaptation of The Government Inspector . The Times wrote of \" a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance \" while Variety noted that the actor \" adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire \" . The Evening Standard , while conceding that the performance was \" technically brilliant \" , expressed bemusement as to why \" one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout \" . Also that year , he took part in the Old Vic 's 24 Hour Play , in which The Telegraph felt he \" dazzled \" . In 2005 film work , Sheen starred in Dead Long Enough , a small-budget Welsh / Irish film , with his longtime friend , Jason Hughes . In addition , he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott 's Kingdom of Heaven , made a cameo appearance in The League of Gentlemen 's Apocalypse and starred in the short film The Open Doors . Sheen came to international attention in 2006 for his portrayal of Tony Blair in The Queen . The film focused on the differing reactions of the British Royal Family and the newly appointed Prime Minister following the death of Diana , Princess of Wales in 1997 ; it was Sheen 's third collaboration with director Stephen Frears and his second with screenwriter Peter Morgan . He enjoyed reprising his role because Blair , at this point in his career , had \" a weight to him that he didn \u2019 t have before \" . When asked to discuss his personal opinion of Blair , Sheen admitted that the more time he spent working on the character , the \" less opinion \" he has of the politician : \" Now when I watch him on TV or hear his voice , it 's sort of like a cross between a family member , a friend and seeing a really old embarrassing video of yourself . \" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised \" a sensational performance , alert and nuanced \" while Empire spoke of an \" uncanny , insightful performance \" . Sheen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role . His second film appearance of 2006 was a supporting role in Blood Diamond as an unscrupulous diamond dealer . Also in 2006 , Sheen starred as the troubled English comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four 's Fantabulosa ! In preparation for the role , he lost two and a half stone ( approx . 35 lbs ) , studied archival footage and read Williams ' published diaries . Sheen has said he is \" fascinated by finding the private side of the public face \" . The Times found his performance \" mesmerising \" while The Observer described it as \" a characterisation for which the description tour-de-force is , frankly , pretty faint praise \" . He won a RTS Award for Best Actor , and received his second BAFTA nomination of 2006 , for Best Television Actor . Sheen starred in two other BBC television productions in 2006 , playing H. G. Wells in HG Wells : War with the World and Nero in Ancient Rome : The Rise and Fall of an Empire . = = = Frost / Nixon and The Damned United ( 2007 \u2013 2009 ) = = = From 2006 to 2007 , Sheen starred as the television broadcaster David Frost in Frost / Nixon at both the Donmar Warehouse and Gielgud Theatre in London and at the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway . The play , written by Peter Morgan , directed by Michael Grandage and co-starring Frank Langella , was a critical and commercial success but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and \" never thought it was going anywhere \" . The Guardian said the actor \" exactly captures Frost 's verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance \" . \" He \u2019 s got the voice , the mannerisms , the blaze , \" said the Financial Times , \" but , more than that , Sheen \u2014 as viscerally exciting an actor as any in Britain today \u2014 shows us the hunger of Frost \u2019 s ambition .. and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill . \" Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance . Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film Music Within as a political activist with cerebral palsy . He spoke of having a \" responsibility \" to accurately portray the condition . Variety said his performance was \" remarkable .. utterly convincing \" , USA Today found him \" outstanding \" while the Los Angeles Times felt he was \" reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot , bringing a vibrancy and wit to the role \" . Also that year , Sheen starred in the short film Airlock , or How To Say Goodbye in Space with Derek Jacobi and was invited to join the actors ' branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences . Sheen reprised the role of David Frost in 2008 's Frost / Nixon , a film dramatisation of The Nixon Interviews of 1977 . Despite appearing in the original stage production in a part written for him by Peter Morgan , Sheen was surprised to have been cast in the film : \" Peter said he 'd only be prepared to give the rights to someone who would cast me as Frost , which was very nice , but when the studios get their hands on something ... Right up until we started filming I was prepared to be disappointed \" . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times asserted that Sheen embodied his character in a \" compelling , intense \" performance while The Wall Street Journal felt he was \" a brilliant actor \" who \" grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator \" . However , The New York Times felt \" the likable , watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer \" in Frank Langella 's Nixon . Frost himself later said it was \" a wonderful performance \" . Sheen was the recipient of the Variety Award at the British Independent Film Awards 2008 . 2009 saw Sheen portray another public figure ; he starred in The Damned United as the outspoken football manager Brian Clough . The Tom Hooper-directed film focused on Clough 's disastrous 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United and marked Sheen 's fifth collaboration with writer Peter Morgan . The actor has said Clough is the real-life character he enjoyed playing most . The Guardian , writing in 2009 , declared it the \" best performance of his big-screen career \" while The Times found him \" magnificent \" . USA Today praised \" Sheen 's masterful performance \" while the Los Angeles Times felt he played the role with \" a cheeky , dark panache \" and \" skillful verve \" . Entertainment Weekly asserted that , despite American audiences ' unfamiliarity with Clough , \" what 's lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen 's astonishing performance \" . Variety noted that his \" typically scrupulous channeling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right , but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth \" . Also in 2009 , Sheen reprised his role as a werewolf in Underworld : Rise of the Lycans , a prequel to the original film . Of his decision to take part , Sheen has said : \" My rule of thumb is that I want to do things I 'd like to go and see myself . \" The New York Times felt he was \" the movie \u2019 s greatest asset ... [ taking ] a lively break from his usual high-crust duties to bring wit , actual acting and some unexpected musculature to the goth-horror flick \" . Variety said he hit \" all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse , if not amaze , anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost \" while Richard Corliss of Time noted that he \" tries bravely to keep a straight face \" Sheen had a supporting role in 2009 's The Twilight Saga : New Moon , the second film in the highly popular vampire series . He was paid a reported \u00a3 5 million fee and director Chris Weitz has said he \" aggressively \" pursued the actor for the role . In its review , Rolling Stone said : \" Late in the film , a real actor , Michael Sheen , shows up as the mind-reading Aro , of the Italian Volturi vampires , and sparks things up . You can almost hear the young cast thinking , ' Is that acting ? It looks hard . ' So Sheen is quickly ushered out . \" While The New York Times said he \" preens with plausible menace \" , USA Today felt he \" plays the character with more high-pitched giddiness than menace \" . He was named Actor of the Year at GQ magazine 's annual Men of the Year ceremony . Sheen made two one-off stage appearances in 2009 ; he performed a scene from Betrayal as part of a Harold Pinter tribute evening at the National Theatre and performed improvisational comedy as part of The Groundlings ' Crazy Joe Show in Los Angeles . = = = Hamlet and Masters of Sex ( 2010 \u2013 present ) = = = In 2010 , Sheen had a supporting role in the science fiction sequel Tron : Legacy . Referring to his David Bowie-esque character , Sheen has said , \" I was paid to show off basically \" . The Wall Street Journal found little fun in the movie \" except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen \" while The New York Times said he \" shows up to deliver the closest thing to a performance in the movie \" . The Daily Telegraph felt his \" lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal \u2014 how inhuman \u2014 much else here is \" . However , USA Today felt his \" scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief , but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring \" . In other 2010 film work , Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton 's Alice in Wonderland and Disney 's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable . On television , Sheen 's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan 's Blair trilogy , The Special Relationship , was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Movie . The HBO film examined the \" special relationship \" between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton . It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan ; both parties have since said they will not work together again \" for the foreseeable future \" . Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC 's 30 Rock as Wesley Snipes , a love interest for Tina Fey 's Liz Lemon .

The event was the subject of both a BBC documentary and The Gospel of Us , a film by director Dave McKean . Sheen has described it as \" the most meaningful experience \" of his career . The Observer declared it \" one of the outstanding theatrical events not only of this year , but of the decade \" . The Independent 's critic described it as \" the most extraordinary piece of community-specific theatre I 've ever beheld \" . While the The Daily Telegraph bemoaned the large-scale production 's logistical problems , \" overall I found it touching , transformative and , in its own wayward way , a triumph . \" The Guardian felt it was \" so much more than just an epic piece of street theatre .. transforming and uplifting \" . Sheen and co-director Bill Mitchell were jointly honoured as Best Director at the Theatre Awards UK 2011 . In 2013 , Sheen was nominated for a Best Actor Welsh BAFTA for The Gospel of Us . Sheen 's most notable film appearance of 2011 was a supporting role in Woody Allen 's Midnight in Paris . Allen noted that \" Michael had to do the pseudo-intellectual , the genuine intellectual , the pedant , and he came in and nailed it from the start \" . Sheen enjoyed playing \" someone who \u2019 s just absolutely got no sense that he \u2019 s overstepping the mark or that he \u2019 s being a bore . \" The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and became Allen 's highest grossing film to date . Also in 2011 , Sheen starred in Beautiful Boy , an independent drama focusing on the aftermath of a school shooting , voiced the enigmatic and mysterious villain House in the Doctor Who episode \" The Doctor 's Wife \" written by his friend Neil Gaiman and made cameo appearances in The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1 and Resistance .

Sheen played the title role in Hamlet at the Young Vic in late 2011 and early 2012 , a role he first explored in a 1999 BBC Radio 3 production . While there had been tentative plans over the years for both Peter Hall and Michael Grandage to direct Sheen in the play , he eventually asked Ian Rickson . Rickson 's production was set in the secure wing of a psychiatric hospital and featured original music by PJ Harvey . The Evening Standard declared Sheen 's performance \" an audacious achievement \" that \" will live in the memory \" while The Independent praised \" a recklessly brilliant and bravura performance . \" The Telegraph felt that Sheen \" could be right up there among the great Hamlets \" while The Times found him \" unbearably moving \" . The Guardian described him as \" fascinating to watch ... intelligent , inventive and full of insights ... [ he ] delivers the \" What a piece of work is man \" passage with a beautiful consciousness of human potential . \" The Observer declared him an actor \" always worth crossing a principality to see and hear \" whose \" \" To be , or not to be \" is a marvel . \" In 2013 , Sheen appeared in a supporting role as the boyfriend of Tina Fey in the comedy Admission , with Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice describing the character as \" a whiskery , elfin academic who chuckles to himself as he reads the Canterbury Tales prologue aloud in bed , in Middle English , no less . ( Sheen is scarily good at this . ) In 2014 , he starred in the fantasy children 's film Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box . R. Kurt Osenlund of Slant Magazine said \" the ever-versatile Sheen brings an artful hamminess to his role \" but Matt Pais of RedEye found him \" insufficiently zany \" in \" a part that Robert Downey Jr. would nail but never accept . \" His second film role of 2014 was a minor role in the political thriller Kill the Messenger . Also in 2014 , he starred in IFC 's six-episode The Spoils of Babylon , a television parody of classic , sweeping miniseries , in which he played the husband of Kristen Wiig 's character . In 2015 , Sheen starred opposite Carey Mulligan in the romantic drama Far from the Madding Crowd as prosperous bachelor William Boldwood . His performance was well received . Anthony Lane of The New Yorker remarked : \" How you prevent such a fellow , crushed by his own decency , from sagging into a bearded Ashley Wilkes is no easy task , yet Sheen succeeds , and Boldwood \u2019 s brave smile grows dreadful to behold . \" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the character \" pitiful , and sometimes downright painful to watch . He \u2019 s not Hardy \u2019 s Boldwood , but he \u2019 s a Boldwood . The only sad , genuine moment of the film belongs to him . \" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked that Sheen 's face \" is etched with agony and an awful kind of abject adoration , forever trying to find ways to forgive the loved one in advance for rejection . When Sheen \u2019 s Boldwood confides to Oak that he feels \u201c grief \u201d you really can feel his pain . \" Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice also referred to the scene where Boldwood expressed his grief , commenting : \" Sheen 's performance is fine-grained , and the pure Englishness of his understatement is heartrending . \" Also in 2015 , Sheen had well-received comedic television performances in Comedy Bang ! Bang ! , The Spoils Before Dying and 7 Days in Hell . Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said his television host in 7 Days in Hell was \" played with damp lechery and cigarette-ash mastery . \" Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire said he may have \" stolen the show \" while John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter described him as the \" scene-stealer of the bunch . \" Since 2013 , Sheen stars in and produces Showtime 's Masters of Sex . He and Lizzy Caplan portray the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson ; the series chronicles \" their unusual lives , romance and pop culture trajectory , which saw them go from a Midwestern teaching hospital to the cover of Time magazine and Johnny Carson \u2019 s couch \" . Willa Paskin of Slate said : \" Sheen is not playing an anti-hero , but someone much more difficult to like \u2014 an anti-charismatic . His Masters is willfully repressed and aggressively passive : He is withholding and cold as a means of besting other people , of outsuffering them . \" David Sims of The Atlantic described Sheen 's portrayal of Masters as \" an intensely honest and unsympathetic one \" while Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club said Sheen played the role \" so seamlessly it \u2019 s hard to remember that there \u2019 s a British actor there who has played flamboyant news personalities and prime ministers . \" Sean T. Collins of The Observer described Masters as \" a singularly unappealing figure \" : \" It \u2019 s not that Michael Sheen is bad in the role . On the contrary ! Sheen \u2019 s skill in playing Masters as an asshole who oscillates between headache-inducing self-repression and volcanic rage renders him unpleasant to spend more than two minutes with at a time . \" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter remarked : \" Masters has never been very likable . In fact , it \u2019 s a testament to Sheen \u2019 s performance \u2014 and Caplan \u2019 s nuanced Johnson offsetting Masters \u2014 that anyone still cares what happens to Masters on a personal level . \" He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in late 2013 .

                    "text": "Emma Thompson = Emma Thompson ( born 15 April 1959 ) is a British actress , a comedian , and a writer . Thompson is known for her portrayals of reticent women and playing haughty or matronly characters with a sense of irony , often in period dramas and literary adaptations . She is considered one of Britain 's most accomplished actresses . Born in London to English actor , Eric Thompson , and Scottish actress , Phyllida Law , Thompson was educated at Newnham College , University of Cambridge , where she became a member of the Footlights troupe . After appearing in several comedy programmes , she first came to prominence in 1987 , in two BBC TV series , Tutti Frutti and Fortunes of War , winning the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for her work in both series . Thompson 's first film role came in the 1989 romantic comedy , The Tall Guy , and in the early 1990s she frequently collaborated with her then husband , actor , and director , Kenneth Branagh . The pair became popular in the British media , and co-starred in several films including : Dead Again ( 1991 ) and Much Ado About Nothing ( 1993 ) . In 1992 , Thompson won multiple acting awards , including an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress , for her work in the period drama , Howards End . In 1993 , she garnered dual Academy Award nominations for her roles in The Remains of the Day as a stately housekeeper , and In the Name of the Father as a lawyer . Thompson scripted and starred in Sense and Sensibility ( 1995 ) , which earned her ( among other awards ) an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay , and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress . Other notable film and television credits include : the Harry Potter film series , Wit ( 2001 ) , Love Actually ( 2003 ) , Angels in America ( 2003 ) , Nanny McPhee ( 2005 ) , Stranger than Fiction ( 2006 ) , Last Chance Harvey ( 2008 ) , Men in Black 3 ( 2012 ) , and Brave ( 2012 ) . In 2013 , she received acclaim and several award nominations for her portrayal of P. L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks . Thompson is married to actor Greg Wise , with whom she lives in London . They have one daughter and an adopted son . She is an activist in the areas of human rights and environmentalism , and has received criticism for her outspoken nature . She has authored two books adapted from The Tale of Peter Rabbit . = = Early life = = Thompson was born in Paddington , London , on 15 April 1959 . A member of a show business family , her mother is the Scottish actress Phyllida Law , while her English father , Eric Thompson , was involved in theatre and the writer \u2013 narrator of the popular children 's television series The Magic Roundabout . Her godfather was the director and writer Ronald Eyre . She has one sister , Sophie Thompson , who also works as an actress . The family lived in West Hampstead in north London , and Thompson was educated at Camden School for Girls . She spent much time in Scotland during her childhood , and often visited Ardentinny where her grandparents and uncle lived . In her youth , Thompson was intrigued by language and literature , a trait which she attributes to her father who shared her love of words . In 1977 , she began studying for an English degree at Newnham College , University of Cambridge . Thompson believes that it was inevitable that she would become an actress , commenting that she was \" surrounded by creative people and I don \u2019 t think it would ever have gone any other way , really \" . While there , she had a \" seminal moment \" that turned her to feminism and inspired her to take up performing . She explained in an interview in 2007 how she discovered the book The Madwoman in the Attic , \" which is about Victorian female writers and the disguises they took on in order to express what they wanted to express . That completely changed my life . \" She became a self-professed \" punk rocker \" , with short red hair and a motorbike , and aspired to be a comedian like Lily Tomlin . At Cambridge , Thompson was invited into Footlights , the university 's prestigious sketch comedy troupe , by its president , Martin Bergman , becoming its first female member . Also in the troupe were fellow actors Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie , and she had a romantic relationship with the latter . Fry recalled that \" there was no doubt that Emma was going the distance . Our nickname for her was Emma Talented . \" In 1980 , Thompson served as the Vice President of Footlights , and co-directed the troupe 's first all-female revue , Women 's Hour . The following year , Thompson and her Footlights team won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for their sketch show The Cellar Tapes . In 1982 , Thompson 's father died as a result of circulatory problems at the age of 52 . The actress has commented that this \" tore [ the family ] to pieces \" , and \" I can 't begin to tell you how much I regret his not being around \" . She added , \" At the same time , it 's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I 've done ... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space . And power . \" = = Acting career = = = = = 1980s : Breaking through = = = Thompson had her first professional role in 1982 , touring in a stage version of Not the Nine O 'Clock News . She then turned to television , where much of her early work came with her Footlights co-stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry . The regional ITV comedy series There 's Nothing To Worry About ! ( 1982 ) was their first outing , followed by the one-off BBC show The Crystal Cube ( 1983 ) . There 's Nothing to Worry About ! later returned as the networked sketch show Alfresco ( 1983 \u2013 84 ) , which ran for two series with Thompson , Fry , Laurie , Ben Elton , and Robbie Coltrane . She later collaborated again with Fry and Laurie on the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 series Saturday Night Fry ( 1988 ) . In 1985 , Thompson was cast in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl , co-starring Robert Lindsay . It provided a breakthrough in her career , as the production earned rave reviews . She played the role of Sally Smith for 15 months , which exhausted the actress ; she later remarked \" I thought if I did the fucking \" Lambeth Walk \" one more time I was going to fucking throw up . \" At the end of 1985 , she wrote and starred in her own one-off special for Channel 4 , Emma Thompson : Up for Grabs . Thompson achieved another breakthrough in 1987 , when she had leading roles in two television miniseries : Fortunes of War , a World War II drama co-starring Kenneth Branagh , and Tutti Frutti , a dark-comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane . For these performances , Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress . The following year , she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC , Thompson , but this was poorly received . In 1989 , she and Branagh \u2014 who had formed a romantic relationship \u2014 starred in a stage revival of Look Back in Anger , directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh 's Renaissance Theatre Company . Later that year , the pair starred in a televised version of the play . Thompson 's first cinema appearance came in the romantic comedy The Tall Guy ( 1989 ) , the feature-film debut from screenwriter Richard Curtis . It starred Jeff Goldblum as a West End actor , and Thompson played the nurse with whom he falls in love . The film was not widely seen , but Thompson 's performance was praised in The New York Times , where Caryn James called her \" an exceptionally versatile comic actress \" . She next turned to Shakespeare , appearing as Princess Katherine in Branagh 's screen adaptation of Henry V ( 1989 ) . The film was released to great critical acclaim . = = = 1990 \u2013 93 : A leading British actress = = = Thompson and Branagh are considered by American writer and critic James Monaco to have led the \" British cinematic onslaught \" in the 1990s . She continued to experiment with Shakespeare in the new decade , appearing with Branagh in his stage productions of A Midsummer Night 's Dream and King Lear . Reviewing the latter , the Chicago Tribune praised her \" extraordinary \" performance of the \" hobbling , stooped hunchback Fool \" . Thompson returned to cinema in 1991 , playing a \" frivolous aristocrat \" in Impromptu , a period drama about the life of George Sand that starred Judy Davis and Hugh Grant . The film received positive reviews , and Thompson was nominated for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards . Her second release of 1991 was another pairing with Branagh , who also directed , in the Los Angeles-based noir Dead Again . She played a woman who has forgotten her identity , and the thriller was number one at the US box office for two weeks . Early in 1992 , Thompson had a guest role in an episode of the American comedy series Cheers as Frasier Crane 's first wife . A turning point in Thompson 's career came when she was cast opposite Anthony Hopkins and Vanessa Redgrave in the Merchant Ivory period drama Howards End ( 1992 ) , based on the novel by E. M. Forster . The film explored the social class system in Edwardian England , with Thompson playing an idealistic , intellectual , forward-looking woman who comes into association with a privileged and deeply conservative family . She actively pursued the role by writing to director James Ivory , who agreed to an audition and then gave her the part . According to the critic Vincent Canby , the film allowed Thompson to \" [ come ] into her own \" , away from Branagh . Upon release , Roger Ebert wrote that she was \" superb in the central role : quiet , ironic , observant , with steel inside . \" Howards End was widely praised , a \" surprise hit \" , and received nine Academy Award nominations . Among its three wins was the Best Actress trophy for Thompson , who was also awarded a Golden Globe and BAFTA for her performance . Reflecting on the role , The New York Times writes that the actress \" found herself an international success almost overnight . \" For her next two films , Thompson returned to working with Branagh . In Peter 's Friends ( 1992 ) , the pair starred with Stephen Fry , Hugh Laurie , Imelda Staunton , and Tony Slattery as a group of Cambridge alumni who are reunited ten years after graduating . The comedy was positively reviewed , and Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote that Thompson was its highlight : \" Even as a rather one-dimensional character , she exudes grace and an adroit sense of comic tragedy . \" She followed this with Branagh 's screen version of Much Ado About Nothing ( 1993 ) . The couple starred as Beatrice and Benedick , alongside a cast that also included Denzel Washington , Keanu Reeves , and Michael Keaton . Thompson was widely praised for the on-screen chemistry with Branagh and the natural ease with which she played the role marking another critical success for Thompson . Her performance earned a nomination for Best Female Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards . Thompson reunited with Merchant \u2013 Ivory and Anthony Hopkins to film The Remains of the Day ( 1993 ) , a film which has been described as a \" classic \" and the production team 's definitive film . Based on Kazuo Ishiguro 's novel about a housekeeper and butler in interwar Britain , the story is acclaimed for its study of loneliness and repression , though Thompson was particularly interested in looking at \" the deformity that servitude inflicts upon people \" , since her grandmother had worked as a servant and made many sacrifices . She has named the film as one of the greatest experiences of her career , considering it to be a \" masterpiece of withheld emotion \" . The Remains of the Day was a critical and commercial success , receiving eight Oscar nominations , including Best Picture and a second Best Actress nod for Thompson . Along with her Best Actress nomination at the 66th Academy Awards , Thompson was also nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category , making her the eighth performer in history to be nominated for two Oscars in the same year . It came for her role as the lawyer Gareth Peirce in In the Name of the Father ( 1993 ) , a drama about the Guildford Four starring Daniel Day-Lewis . The film was her second hit of the year , earning $ 65 million and critical praise , and was nominated for Best Picture along with The Remains of the Day . = = = 1994 \u2013 98 : Sense and Sensibility and Hollywood roles = = = In 1994 , Thompson made her Hollywood debut playing a goofy doctor alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in the blockbuster Junior . Although the male pregnancy storyline was poorly received by most critics , Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the lead trio . She returned to independent cinema for a lead role in Carrington , which studied the platonic relationship between artist Dora Carrington and writer Lytton Strachey ( played by Jonathan Price ) . Roger Ebert remarked that Thompson had \" developed a specialty in unrequited love \" , and the TV Guide Film & Video Companion commented that her \" neurasthenic mannerisms , which usually drive us batty , are appropriate here \" . Thompson 's Academy success continued with Sense and Sensibility ( 1995 ) , generally considered to be the most popular and authentic of the numerous film adaptions of Jane Austen 's novels made in the 1990s . Thompson \u2014 a lifelong lover of Austen 's work \u2014 was hired to write the film based on the period sketches in her series Thompson . She spent five years developing the screenplay , and took the role of the spinster sister Elinor Dashwood despite , at 35 , being 16 years older than the literary character . Directed by Ang Lee and co-starring Kate Winslet , Sense and Sensibility received widespread critical praise and is one of the highest-grossing films of Thompson 's career . Shelly Frome remarked that she displayed a \" great affinity for Jane Austen 's style and wit \" , and Graham Fuller of Sight and Sound saw her as the film 's auteur . Thompson received a third nomination for Best Actress and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay , making her the only person in history to win an Oscar for both acting and writing . She also earned a second BAFTA Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay . Thompson was absent from screens in 1996 , but returned the following year with Alan Rickman 's directorial debut , The Winter Guest . Set over one day in a Scottish seaside village , the drama allowed Thompson and her mother ( Phyllida Law ) to play mother and daughter on screen . She then returned to America to appear in an episode of Ellen , and her self-parodying performance received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series . For her second Hollywood role , Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols 's Primary Colors ( 1998 ) , playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton . Thompson 's character , Susan , is described as that of an \" ambitious , long-suffering wife \" who has to deal with her husband 's infidelity . The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office . According to Kevin O 'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror , Americans were \" blown away \" by her performance and accent , and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her . Thompson rejected many of the offers , expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards , and stated \" LA is lovely as long as you know you can leave \" . She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point , which influenced her decision to leave film for a year . Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss ( 1998 ) . = = = 2000s : Smaller roles = = = When she became a mother in 1999 , Thompson made a conscious decision to reduce her workload , and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles . She was not seen on screen again until 2000 , with only a small part in the British comedy Maybe Baby , which she appeared in as a favour to its director , her friend Ben Elton . For the HBO television film Wit ( 2001 ) , however , Thompson happily took the lead role in what she felt was \" one of the best scripts to have come out of America \" . Adapted from Margaret Edson 's Pulitzer Prize winning play , it focusses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer . Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project , and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right . She was greatly drawn to the \" daredevil \" role , for which she had no qualms about shaving her head . Reviewing the performance , Roger Ebert was touched by \" the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect \" , and in 2008 he called it Thompson 's finest work . Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as \" one of her most brilliant performances \" , adding \" we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body . \" The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes , Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards . Thompson 's only credit of 2002 was a vocal performance in Disney 's Treasure Planet , an adaptation of Treasure Island , where she voiced Captain Amelia . The animation earned far less than its large budget and was considered a \" box office disaster \" . This failure was countered the following year by one of Thompson 's biggest commercial successes , Richard Curtis 's romantic comedy Love Actually . As part of an ensemble cast that included Liam Neeson , Keira Knightley , and Colin Firth , she played a middle-class wife who suspects her husband ( played by Alan Rickman ) of infidelity . The scene in which her stalwart character breaks down was described by one critic as \" the best crying on screen ever \" , and in 2013 , Thompson mentioned that she gets commended for this role more than any other . She explained , \" I 've had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom then having to go out and be cheerful , gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer . \" Her performance received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Thompson continued with supporting roles in the 2003 drama Imagining Argentina , where she played a dissident-journalist abducted by the country 's 1970s dictatorial regime . Antonio Banderas played the husband who tries to find her , in a film that most critics disliked . The film was booed and jeered at when it was screened at the Venice Film Festival and received a scathing article in The Guardian . Thompson had greater success that year when she worked with HBO for a second time in the acclaimed miniseries Angels in America ( 2003 ) . The show , also featuring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep , dealt with the AIDS epidemic in Reagan-era America . Thompson played three small roles \u2013 a nurse , a homeless woman , and an angel \u2013 and was again nominated for an Emmy Award . In 2004 , she played the eccentric Divination teacher Sybill Trelawney in the third Harry Potter film , the Prisoner of Azkaban , her character described as a \" hippy chick professor who teaches fortune-telling \" . She later reprised her role in the Order of the Phoenix ( 2007 ) and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 ( 2011 ) , and has called her time on the popular franchise \" great fun \" . The year 2005 saw the release of a project Thompson had been working on for nine years . Loosely based on the Nurse Matilda stories that she read as a child , Thompson wrote the screenplay for the children 's film Nanny McPhee \u2013 which centres on a mysterious , unsightly nanny who must discipline a group of children . She also took the lead role , alongside Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury , in what was a highly personal project . The film was a success , taking number one at the UK box office and earning $ 122 million worldwide . Commenting on Thompson 's screenplay , film critic Claudia Puig wrote that its \" well-worn storybook features are woven effectively into an appealing tale of youthful empowerment \" . The following year , Thompson appeared in the surreal American comedy \u2013 drama Stranger than Fiction , playing a novelist whose latest character ( played by Will Ferrell ) is a real person who hears her narration in his head . Reviews for the film were generally favourable . Following a brief , uncredited role in the post-apocalyptic blockbuster I Am Legend ( 2007 ) , Thompson played the devoutly Catholic Lady Marchmain in a 2008 film adaptation of Brideshead Revisited . Critics were unenthusiastic about the film , but several picked Thompson out as its highlight . Mark Kermode said \" Emma Thompson is to some extent becoming the new Judi Dench , as the person who kind of comes in for 15 minutes and is brilliant ... [ but then ] when she goes away , the rest of the movie has a real problem living up to the wattage of her presence \" . Thompson was further acclaimed for her work in the London-based romance Last Chance Harvey ( 2008 ) , where she and Dustin Hoffman played a lonely , middle-aged pair who cautiously begin a relationship . Critics praised the chemistry between the two leads , and both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances . Thompson 's two 2009 films were both set in 1960s England , and in both she made cameo appearances : as a headmistress in the critically praised drama An Education and as a \" tippling mother \" in Richard Curtis 's The Boat that Rocked . = = = 2010s : Veteran performer = = = Five years after the original , Thompson returned to Nanny McPhee with 2010 's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang . Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War , and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal . Building on the first film 's success , it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was widely seen as an improvement . The same year , Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch , which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship . Thompson 's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination . In 2012 , Thompson made a rare appearance in a big-budget Hollywood film when she played the head Agent in Men in Black 3 \u2013 a continuation of the popular sci-fi comedy franchise starring Will Smith . With a worldwide gross of $ 624 million , MIB3 is Thompson 's biggest commercial hit outside of the Harry Potter films . This mainstream success continued with the Pixar film Brave , in which Thompson voiced Elinor \u2013 the Scottish queen despairing at her daughter 's defiance against tradition . It was her second consecutive blockbuster release , and critics were generally kind to the film . Also in 2012 , Thompson played Queen Elizabeth II in an episode of Playhouse Presents , which dramatised an incident in 1982 when an intruder broke into the Queen 's bedroom . Her first film of 2013 was the fantasy romance Beautiful Creatures , in which she played an evil mother . The film aimed to capitalise on the success of The Twilight Saga , but was poorly reviewed and a box office disappointment . Film critic Peter Travers was critical of Thompson 's performance and \" outrageously awful Southern accent \" , and feared \" the damage this crock may do to [ her ] reputation \" . Conversely , her next appearance was so successful that it led one journalist to write \" Emma Thompson is back , firing on all cylinders . \" Saving Mr. Banks depicted the making of Mary Poppins , and starred Thompson as P. L. Travers , curmudgeonly author of the source novel , and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney . The actress considered it the best screenplay she had read in years and was delighted to be offered the role . She considered it to be the most challenging of her career because she had \" never really played anyone quite so contradictory or difficult before \" , but found the inconsistent and complicated character \" a blissful joy to embody \" . The film was well-received , grossed $ 112 million worldwide , and critics were unanimous in their praise for Thompson 's performance . The review in The Independent expressed thanks that her \" playing of Travers is so deft that we instantly warm to her , and forgive her her snobbery \" , while Total Film 's critic felt that Thompson brought depth to the \" predictable \" film with \" her best performance in years \" . Thompson was nominated for Best Actress at the BAFTAs , SAGs and Golden Globes , and received the Lead Actress trophy from the National Board of Review . Meryl Streep stated that she was \" shocked \" to see that Thompson did not receive an Academy Award nomination for the film . The romantic-comedy The Love Punch ( 2013 ) gave Thompson her second consecutive leading role , where she and Pierce Brosnan played a divorced couple who reunite to steal his ex-boss 's jewellery . In March 2014 , she made her first stage appearance in 24 years \u2013 and her New York debut \u2013 in a Lincoln Center production of Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street . She appeared in the musical for five nights , and her \" playful \" performance of Mrs Lovett was highly praised ; the critic Kayla Epstein wrote that she \" not only held her own against more experienced vocalists , but wound up running off with the show . \" She received her sixth Emmy nomination for the televised version of the show . In 2014 , Thompson provided the narration for Jason Reitman 's film Men , Women & Children , before seeing the release of a project she had been working on for many years . The drama Effie Gray , based on the true-life story of art critic John Ruskin 's marriage , was written by Thompson but was subject to a copyright case before being cleared for cinemas . The American playwright Gregory Murphy claimed Effie Gray infringed on his play and screenplay The Countess , which deals with the same story and which Murphy says he submitted to Thompson and her husband Greg Wise to play the roles they subsequently played in Thompson 's film . In March 2013 a judge , after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence , ruled that the works were \" quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events , \" but noted twelve significant similarities between Murphy 's play and screenplay and Thompson 's screenplay that could not be accounted for even after taking into consideration their \" shared historical backgrounds . \" Effie Gray was finally released in October 2014 , to a modest reception . Thompson appeared in the film , alongside her husband Greg Wise and actress Dakota Fanning , but declined to promote it , as did Mr. Wise . Thompson 's first film of 2015 was A Walk in the Woods , a comedy adapted from the book by Bill Bryson , where she appeared opposite Robert Redford and Nick Nolte . She next starred with Robert Carlyle in his directoral debut The Legend of Barney Thomson . Her role was his 77-year-old mother , a Glaswegian foul-mouthed , chain-smoking former prostitute . Neither film was a critical success , although the latter received some positive reviews and Empire magazine wrote that Thomson was \" unforgettable \" . Later that year , she had a supporting role in John Wells ' restaurant-based film Burnt , alongside Bradley Cooper . In 2016 , she starred with Brendan Gleeson in the World War II-drama Alone in Berlin , based on the story of Otto and Elise Hampel . As of April 2016 , Thompson has three upcoming roles . In Bridget Jones 's Baby , for which she also co-wrote the screenplay , she will play a doctor . The film is released in September . She will also appear as Mrs Potts in Disney 's upcoming live action film Beauty and the Beast , and has a supporting role as a hippy in Noah Baumbach 's dramedy Yeh Din Ka Kissa , both scheduled for 2017 . = = Reception and acting style = = Thompson is widely considered to be one of the finest actresses of her generation and one of Britain 's best-known actresses , accepted in Hollywood . Early in her career , when she was closely associated with her first husband Kenneth Branagh , she was somewhat unpopular and considered a \" luvvy \" . The public warmed to her after the separation , and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s . Her status has continued to grow ; in 2008 , journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience , and Mark Kermode and said of her performances , \" There is something about her which is - you just trust her . You just think ' I 'm in proper hands here . ' ... She 's up there with the great , I mean really great , British female performers \" . Thompson is particularly known for playing reticent women , and Sands describes her as \" the best actress of our times on suffering borne with poignant dignity \" . According to Kate Kellaway of The Guardian , she specialises in playing \" a good woman in a frock \" . She also plays many haughty characters , with a \" bracing , nanny-like demeanour \" , but she is noted for her ability to win the empathy of audiences . Thompson belongs to a group of highly decorated British actresses including Judi Dench , Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham Carter who are known for appearing in \" heritage films \" and typically showing \" restraint , rendering emotions through intellect rather than feelings , and a sense of irony , which demonstrates the heroine 's superior understanding \" . Projecting a typically \" British image \" , Thompson 's often dogmatic and tight-jawed manner has also been compared to Maggie Smith . With a background in comedy , Thompson 's performances are typically delivered with an ironic touch . Ang Lee , director of Sense and Sensibility stated that Thompson 's comedic approach may be her greatest asset as an actress , remarking , \" Emma is an extremely funny lady . Like Austen , she 's laughing at her own culture while she 's a part of it . \" Thompson has stated that the \" most moving things are often also funny , in life and in art \" which is present in her film work . She often brings her real personality to her roles , and Kellaway believes that her lack of conventional beauty contributes to her likeability as an actress . = = Personal life = = Thompson , although born in London , has confessed to feeling Scottish : \" not only because I am half Scottish but also because I 've spent half my life here \" . She frequently returns to Scotland and visits Dunoon in Argyll and Bute , where she owns a home . Thompson 's first husband was the actor and director Kenneth Branagh , whom she met in 1987 while filming the television series Fortunes of War . The couple married in 1989 and proceeded to appear in several films together , with Branagh often casting her in his own productions . Dubbed a \" golden couple \" by the British media , the relationship received considerable press interest . The pair attempted to keep their relationship private , refusing to be interviewed or photographed together . In September 1995 , Thompson and Branagh announced that they had separated ; their statement to the press blamed their work schedules , but it later emerged that he had fallen in love with actress Helena Bonham Carter . Thompson was living alone as the relationship with Branagh deteriorated , and entered into clinical depression . While filming Sense and Sensibility in 1995 , she began a relationship with her co-star Greg Wise . Commenting on how she was able to overcome her depression , she told BBC Radio Four , \" Work saved me and Greg saved me . He picked up the pieces and put them together again . \" In 1999 , the couple had a daughter , Gaia , born when Thompson was 39 . The pregnancy was achieved through IVF treatment ; afterwards Wise and Thompson attempted to have another child using the same method . Three years of further IVF treatment were unsuccessful . In 2003 , Thompson and Wise were married in Dunoon . The family 's permanent residence is in West Hampstead , London , on the same road where she lived in her youth . Also in 2003 , Thompson and her husband informally adopted a Rwandan orphan and former child soldier named Tindyebwa Agaba . They met at a Refugee Council event when he was 16 , and she invited him to spend Christmas at their home . \" Slowly , \" Thompson has commented , \" he became a sort of permanent fixture , came on holiday to Scotland with us , became part of the family . \" Tindy became a British citizen in 2009 . = = = Views and activism = = = Thompson has said of her religious views : \" I 'm an atheist ... I regard religion with fear and suspicion . It 's not enough to say that I don 't believe in God . I actually regard the system as distressing : I am offended by some of the things said in the Bible and the Qur 'an and I refute them . \" Despite this , she has said that she approves of the \" guiding moral principles \" of the Christian tradition \" if applied properly \" , and that she observes Christmas . She is politically liberal and a supporter of the Labour Party ; she told the BBC Andrew Marr Show in 2010 that she had been a member of the party \" all my life . \" She supports the socialist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn . Thompson has been a campaigner since her youth . Since becoming a public figure she has regularly voiced her views and been involved in many issues , prompting criticism that she is overly outspoken . In 2010 , The Daily Telegraph asked : \" Emma Thompson : a national treasure or Britain 's most annoying woman ? \" She has justified her assertiveness by saying , \" what I feel is that we all need to speak up and a woman who has got a louder voice needs to shout very loudly indeed . \" She is particularly active in human rights work . As an ambassador for the charity ActionAid she has travelled to Uganda , Mozambique , Ethiopia , Liberia , and Burma . She is chair of the Helen Bamber Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture , a patron of the Refugee Council , and has a therapy room in her office for traumatised refugees . Thompson is also an activist for Palestinians , having been a member of the British-based ENOUGH ! coalition that seeks to end the \" Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank . \" She is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation , and in 2009 Time named her a \" European Hero \" in recognition of \" her work to highlight the plight of Aids sufferers in Africa . \" Aside from humanitarian work , Thompson is also an active environmentalist . She is a supporter of Greenpeace , and in January 2009 , as part of her campaign against climate change , she and three other members of the organisation bought land near the village of Sipson to deter the building of a third runway for Heathrow Airport . In August 2014 , Thompson and her daughter , Gaia , went on a Greenpeace \" Save the Arctic \" expedition to raise awareness of the dangers of drilling for oil . She is also an ambassador for the Galapagos Conservation Trust . In May 2016 Thompson announced that she would be supporting the Women 's Equality Party in the 2016 London mayoral election . Writing in The Guardian she said , \" I am backing the Women \u2019 s Equality party because I really do not want to die before closing the pay gap , which stands , in our great and supposedly modern capital city , at 23 % . \" = = Books = = In 2012 , Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an addition to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit . She was approached by the publishers to write it , the first authorised Peter story since 1930 and the only one not written by Potter . The book falls in the middle of the earlier series , rather than at the end , and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor 's garden and into Scotland . It was a New York Times Best Seller . In 2013 , Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit . = = Filmography and awards = = As of December 2015 Thompson has appeared in 40 films , 20 television programmes and eight stage productions . She has won and been nominated for many awards during her career , including five Academy Award nominations ( winning two ) , nine Golden Globe Award nominations ( winning two ) , seven BAFTA Award nominations ( winning three ) , and six Emmy Award nominations ( winning one ) .",

                    "text": "Leslie Nielsen = Leslie William Nielsen , OC ( 11 February 1926 \u2013 28 November 2010 ) was a Canadian actor , comedian , and producer . He appeared in more than 100 films and 150 television programs , portraying more than 220 characters . Nielsen was born in Regina , Saskatchewan . He enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and later worked as a disc jockey before receiving a scholarship to study theatre at the Neighborhood Playhouse . Making his acting debut in 1948 , he made more than 50 television appearances two years later . Nielsen made his film debut in 1956 , with supporting roles in several drama , western , and romance films produced between the 1950s and the 1970s , with Nielsen crossing genres in both television and films . Although his notable performances in the films Forbidden Planet and The Poseidon Adventure gave him standing as a serious actor , Nielsen later gained enduring recognition for his deadpan comedy roles during the 1980s and the early 1990s , after being cast against type for the Zucker , Abrahams and Zucker comedy film Airplane ! . Nielsen specialized in his portrayal of characters oblivious to and complicit in their absurd surroundings , which gave him a reputation as a comedian . Airplane ! marked Nielsen 's turning point , which made him \" the Olivier of spoofs \" according to film critic Roger Ebert ; his work on the film also led to further success in the genre with The Naked Gun film series , which are based on their earlier short-lived television series Police Squad ! , in which he also starred . Nielsen received a variety of awards and was inducted into the Canada and Hollywood Walks of Fame . = = Early life = = Nielsen was born on 11 February 1926 in Regina , Saskatchewan . His mother , Mabel Elizabeth ( n\u00e9e Davies ) , was a Welsh immigrant , and his father , Ingvard Eversen Nielsen , was a Danish-born constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . Nielsen had two brothers ; the elder , Erik Nielsen ( 1924 \u2013 2008 ) , was Deputy Prime Minister of Canada from 1984 to 1986 . His half-uncle , Jean Hersholt , was an actor known for his portrayal of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name and the subsequent television series and films . In a 1994 Boston Globe article , Nielsen explained , \" I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle , people would look at me as if I were the biggest liar in the world . Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies , and things changed quite drastically . So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea , much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it . My uncle died not too long after I was in a position to know him . I regret that I had not a chance to know him better . \" Nielsen lived for several years in Fort Norman ( now Tulita ) , Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . His father was a troubled man who beat his wife and sons , and Leslie longed to escape . When he graduated from high school at 17 , he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf ( he wore hearing aids most of his life ) . Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton , Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II . He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas . He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary , Alberta , radio station , before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts , Toronto . While studying in Toronto , Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse . He noted , \" I couldn 't refuse , but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose , the moose and wool to New York , you 're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed . As long as I didn 't open my mouth , I felt a certain security . But I always thought I was going to be unmasked : ' OK , pack your stuff . ' ' Well , what 's the matter ? ' ' We 've discovered you have no talent ; we 're shipping you back to Canada . ' \" He moved to New York City for his scholarship , studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse , while performing in summer stock theatre . Afterward , he attended the Actors Studio , until making his first television appearance in 1948 on an episode of Studio One , alongside Charlton Heston , for which he was paid $ 75 . = = Career = = = = = Early career = = = Nielsen 's career began in dramatic roles on television during \" Television 's Golden Age \" , appearing in almost 50 live programs in 1950 alone . He said there \" was very little gold , we only got $ 75 or $ 100 per show . \" He narrated documentaries and commercials and most of his early work as a dramatic actor was uneventful . Hal Erickson of Allmovie noted that \" much of Nielsen 's early work was undistinguished ; he was merely a handsome leading man in an industry overstocked with handsome leading men . \" In 1956 he made his feature film debut in the Michael Curtiz-directed musical film The Vagabond King . In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , Nielsen remembered Curtiz as \" a sadist , a charming sadist , but a sadist \" . Nielsen called this film \" The Vagabond Turkey \" . Though the film was not a success , producer Nicholas Nayfack offered him an audition for the science fiction film Forbidden Planet , resulting in Nielsen 's taking a long contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) . Forbidden Planet became an instant success , and roles in other MGM films such as Ransom ! ( 1956 ) , The Opposite Sex ( 1956 ) and Hot Summer Night ( 1957 ) followed . In 1957 he won the lead role opposite Debbie Reynolds in the romantic comedy Tammy and the Bachelor , which , as a Chicago Tribune critic wrote in 1998 , made people consider Nielsen a dramatic actor and handsome romantic lead . However , dissatisfied with the films he was offered , calling the studios \" a Tiffany , which had forgotten how to make silver \" , Nielsen left MGM after auditioning for Messala in the 1959 Ben-Hur . Stephen Boyd got the role . After leaving the studios , Nielsen landed the lead role in the Disney miniseries The Swamp Fox , as American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion . In a 1988 interview he reflected on the series , saying , \" That was a great experience , because the Disney people didn 't do their shows like everyone else , knocking out an episode a week . ... We only had to do an episode a month , and the budgets were extremely high for TV at that time . We had location shooting rather than cheap studio backdrops , and very authentic costumes . \" Eight episodes were produced and aired between 1959 and 1961 . His television appearances include Justice , Alfred Hitchcock Presents , Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea , The Virginian , and The Wild Wild West . In 1961 , he was the lead in a Los Angeles police drama called The New Breed . He guest-starred in a 1964 episode of Daniel Boone with Fess Parker in a minor but credited role . In 1968 , he had a major role in the pilot for the police series Hawaii Five-O , and appeared in one of the seventh-season episodes . In 1969 , he had the leading role as a police officer in The Bold Ones : The Protectors . In 1972 , Nielsen appeared as the ship 's captain in the The Poseidon Adventure . He also starred in the William Girdler 's 1977 action film , Project : Kill . His last dramatic role before mainly comedy roles was the 1979 Canadian disaster film City on Fire , in which he played a corrupt mayor . In 1980 , he guest-starred as Sinclair on the CBS miniseries The Chisholms . = = = Airplane ! and The Naked Gun = = = Nielsen 's supporting role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker , Abrahams and Zucker 's 1980 's Airplane ! was a watershed in his career . The film , a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour ! and Airport , was based on building a comedy around the actors known for dramatic roles . Other stars included Robert Stack , Peter Graves , and Lloyd Bridges . Nielsen 's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him . When asked , \" Surely you can 't be serious ? \" , he responded with a curt , \" I am serious . And don 't call me Shirley . \" In several interviews he reflected on the line : \" I thought it was amusing , but it never occurred to me that it was going to become a trademark . It 's such a surprise ... the thing comes out , people say , ' What did he say ? ! ' \" Nielsen said he was \" ... pleased and honored that [ he ] had a chance to deliver that line . \" The comedic exchange was at # 79 on the American Film Institute 's AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes . The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008 , and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time , while in 2012 Empire magazine voted it No. 1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll . Critics praised the film , which also proved a long-term success with audiences . In 2010 Airplane ! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress . The directors cast Nielsen for his ability to play like \" a fish in water \" , saying \" You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking , goofing off , and silly ... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy . \" For Nielsen , Airplane ! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy . When it was suggested his role in Airplane ! was against type , Nielsen protested that he had \" always been cast against type before \" , and that comedy was what he always wanted to do . The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style , in their TV series Police Squad ! . The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin , the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series . Police Squad 's opening sequence was based on the 1950s show M Squad , which starred Lee Marvin , which opened with footage of a police car roving through a dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz song in the background . The voice-over and the show 's organization into acts with an epilogue was homage to Quinn Martin police dramas including The Fugitive , The Streets of San Francisco , Barnaby Jones , The F.B.I. , and Cannon . Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags that were happening around him . Although the show lasted only six episodes Nielsen received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series . Six years after cancellation of Police Squad ! , the film The Naked Gun : From the Files of Police Squad ! returned Nielsen to his role as Frank Drebin . It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II . Drebin , like the doctor in Airplane ! , seemed unaware of the absurdity of the scenes he was in , even while contributing to it . Nielsen did many of his own stunts : \" You have an idea of how you 're going to do something , and it 's your vision ... unless you do it , it really doesn 't stand a chance . \" This movie grossed over $ 78 million and was well received by critics . Ebert 's 3 \u00bd \u2013 star review ( out of four ) noted , \" You laugh , and then you laugh at yourself for laughing . \" The Naked Gun spawned two sequels : The Naked Gun 2 \u00bd : The Smell of Fear ( 1991 ) and Naked Gun 33 \u2153 : The Final Insult ( 1994 ) . Naked Gun 2 \u00bd grossed more than the original , with $ 86.9 million , while Naked Gun 33 \u2153 grossed $ 51.1 million . Nielsen remained open to a fourth Naked Gun film , although he doubted that it would be produced \u2014 \" I don 't think so \" , he said in 2005 . \" If there hasn 't been one by now , I doubt it . I think it would be wonderful . \" Nielsen briefly appeared on the World Wrestling Federation program in the summer of 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw ; capitalizing on Frank Drebin . Nielsen ( and George Kennedy ) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January 's Royal Rumble event . At SummerSlam 1994 , in a Naked Gun parody , they were hot on the case ( in fact , they were standing on a case ) . Although they did not find The Undertaker , the case had been closed ( the literal case had been shut ) and thus , they solved the mystery . In 1990 , Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider . Non-comedic roles after Airplane ! included Prom Night ( 1980 ) and Creepshow ( 1982 ) , both horror films , and as a dramatic and unsympathetic character in the 1986 comedy Soul Man . His last dramatic role was as Allen Green , a violent client of a prostitute killed in self-defence by Barbra Streisand 's character , Claudia Draper , in Martin Ritt 's courtroom drama Nuts ( 1987 ) . = = = Later comedies = = = Subsequent to Airplane ! and The Naked Gun , Nielsen portrayed similar styled roles in a number of other films . These mostly emulated the style of The Naked Gun with varying success and often targeted specific films : many were panned by critics and most performed poorly . Repossessed ( 1990 ) and 2001 : A Space Travesty ( 2001 ) were parodies of The Exorcist and 2001 : A Space Odyssey , respectively . Both attempted absurd comedy but were poorly received . Even a leading role in a Mel Brooks comic horror , Dracula : Dead and Loving It , failed to generate much box office excitement , although it did gain a following later release to video . Both 1996 's Spy Hard and 1998 's Wrongfully Accused , a parody of James Bond films and The Fugitive , were popular on video but not well received by critics . His attempt at children 's comedies met additional criticism . Surf Ninjas ( 1993 ) and Mr. Magoo ( 1997 ) had scathing reviews . Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen 's role in Surf Ninjas was only \" an extended cameo \" and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers \" avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen outside of the Naked Gun series . \" Jeff Miller of the Houston Chronicle panned Mr. Magoo , a live action remake of the 1950s cartoon , by saying , \" I 'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better but I can 't think of anything to say other than to make the film again . \" Nielsen 's first major success since The Naked Gun came in a supporting role in Scary Movie 3 ( 2003 ) . His appearance as President Harris led to a second appearance in its sequel , Scary Movie 4 ( 2006 ) . This was the first time Nielsen had reprised a character since Frank Drebin . In one scene , Nielsen appeared almost nude , and one critic referred to the scene as putting \" the ' scary ' in Scary Movie 4 . \" = = = Video , stage , and celebrity productions = = = Nielsen also produced instructional golf videos , which were not presented in a serious style , beginning with 1993 's Bad Golf Made Easier . The videos combined comedy with golf techniques . The series spawned two additional sequels , Bad Golf My Way ( 1994 ) and Stupid Little Golf Video ( 1997 ) . Nielsen also co-wrote a fictional autobiography titled The Naked Truth . The book portrayed Nielsen as a popular actor with a long history of prestigious films . In his eighties , Nielsen performed serious roles on screen and stage ( such as his one-man theatre show Darrow , in which he played Clarence Darrow ) , as well as providing voice-overs and appearances for commercials ; cartoons like Zeroman where he had the leading role / voice ; children 's shows , such as Pumper Pups , which he narrated , in addition to comedic film roles . The sibling relationship with his elder brother , the Honourable Erik Nielsen , a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada , served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled The Canadian Conspiracy in which Leslie Nielsen appeared , along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities . He was a celebrity contestant on CBS 's Gameshow Marathon , where he played The Price Is Right , Let 's Make a Deal , Beat the Clock , and Press Your Luck for charity . = = = Final acting years = = = Beginning in February 2007 , Nielsen began playing a small role as a doctor in the humorous yet educational television show Doctor * Ology . The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology , on the Discovery Channel . Nielsen said : \" There are any number of things that you think about when you ponder if you hadn 't been an actor , what would you be , and I 've always said I 'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor . I have such admiration for doctors . I just don 't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world 's most remarkable new discoveries . \" In 2007 , Nielsen starred in the drama Music Within . In 2008 , he portrayed a version of Uncle Ben for Superhero Movie , a spoof of superhero films . He then appeared in the 2008 parody An American Carol , which David Zucker directed , produced and co-wrote . He appeared in the 2009 parody Stan Helsing . Nielsen portrayed the Doctor in the Spanish horror comedy Spanish Movie , a spoof comedy like Scary Movie , but making fun of popular Spanish films . Nielsen appeared in more than 100 films and 1,500 television episodes , portraying more than 220 characters . = = Personal life = = Nielsen married four times : nightclub singer Monica Boyar ( 1950 \u2013 1956 ) , Alisande Ullman ( 1958 \u2013 1973 ) , Brooks Oliver ( 1981 \u2013 1983 ) and Barbaree Earl ( 2001 \u2013 2010 ) . Nielsen had two daughters from his second marriage , Maura and Thea Nielsen . Nielsen often played golf . He joked , \" I have no goals or ambition . I do , however , wish to work enough to maintain whatever celebrity status I have so that they will continue to invite me to golf tournaments . \" His interest in the sport led him to comedic instructional films . Nielsen was a practical joker , and known for pranking people with a portable hand-controlled fart machine : \" he always had that fart machine with him . \" His epitaph read : \" Let ' er rip \" , a final reference to his favourite practical joke . Nielsen was legally deaf and wore hearing aids for most of his life . Because of this impairment , he supported the Better Hearing Institute . Later in life , Nielsen had knee osteoarthritis . He participated in an educational video from The Arthritis Research Centre of Canada ( ARC ) , demonstrating the physical examination of a patient with knee osteoarthritis . = = Death = = In November 2010 , Nielsen was admitted to a Fort Lauderdale , Florida , hospital with pneumonia . On 28 November , Doug Nielsen , Nielsen 's nephew , told the CJOB radio station that 84-year-old Nielsen had died in his sleep from pneumonia around 5 : 30 pm EST surrounded by family and friends . He was interred in Fort Lauderdale 's Evergreen Cemetery . As a final bit of humor , Nielsen chose \" Let ' er rip \" as his epitaph . = = Achievements = = Among his awards , in 1995 Nielsen received UCLA 's Jack Benny Award . In 1988 , he became the 1,884th personality to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6541 Hollywood Blvd . In 2001 he was inducted into Canada 's Walk of Fame . The following year he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada , although he was also a naturalized US citizen . With his American status , he maintained his Canadian heritage : \" There 's no way you can be a Canadian and think you can lose it ... Canadians are a goodly group . They are very aware of caring and helping . \" On 19 May 2005 , during the centennial gala of his birth province , Saskatchewan , Leslie Nielsen was introduced to HM Queen Elizabeth II . In 1997 , a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs , California , Walk of Stars was dedicated to him . On 20 February 2002 , Nielsen was named an honorary citizen of West Virginia and an Ambassador of Mountain State Goodwill . Nielsen visited the state many times to speak and visit friends . In 2003 , in honour of Nielsen , Grant MacEwan College named its school of communications after him .

                    "text": "WWV ( radio station ) = WWV is the call sign of the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology 's ( NIST ) HF ( \" shortwave \" ) radio station near Fort Collins , Colorado . WWV continuously transmits official U.S. Government frequency and time signals on 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 MHz . These carrier frequencies and time signals are controlled by local atomic clocks traceable to NIST 's primary standard in Boulder , Colorado by GPS common view observations and other time transfer methods . NIST also operates the very similar radio station WWVH in Kauai , Hawaii . WWV and WWVH make recorded announcements ; since they share frequencies , WWV uses a male voice to distinguish itself from WWVH , which uses a female voice . They also make other recorded announcements of general interest , e.g. , the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings . WWV shares its site near Fort Collins with radio station WWVB that transmits carrier and time code ( no voice ) on 60 kHz in the LF ( \" longwave \" ) band . = = History = = = = = Launch = = = WWV is the oldest continuously-operating radio station in the United States , first going on the air from Washington , D.C. in May 1920 , approximately six months before the launch of KDKA . The station first broadcast Friday evening concerts on 600 kHz , and its signal could be heard 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) from Washington . On December 15 , 1920 , WWV began broadcasting on 750 kHz , distributing Morse code news reports from the Department of Agriculture . This signal could be heard up to 300 kilometers ( 190 mi ) from Washington . These news broadcasts ended on April 15 , 1921 . = = = Standard frequency signals = = = At the end of 1922 , WWV 's purpose shifted to broadcasting standard frequency signals . These signals were desperately needed by other broadcasters , because equipment limitations at the time meant that the broadcasters could not stay on their assigned frequencies . Testing began on January 29 , 1923 , and frequencies from 200 to 545 kHz were broadcast . Frequency broadcasts officially began on March 6 , 1923 . The frequencies were accurate to \" better than three-tenths of one percent . \" At first , the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next , using a wavemeter . The first quartz oscillators were invented in the mid-1920s , and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV 's frequency broadcasts . In 1926 , WWV was nearly shut down . Its signal could only cover the eastern half of the United States , and other stations located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant . The station 's impending shutdown was announced in 1926 , but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service . Later , in 1931 , WWV underwent an upgrade . Its transmitter , now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator , was moved to College Park , Maryland . Broadcasts began on 5 MHz . A year later , the station was moved again , to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville , Maryland . Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15 MHz , power was increased , and time signals , an A440 tone , and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937 . WWV was nearly destroyed by a fire on November 6 , 1940 . The frequency and transmitting equipment was recovered , and the station was back on the air ( with reduced power ) on November 11 . Congress funded a new station in July 1941 , and it was built 5 kilometres ( 3.1 mi ) south of the former location , still referred to as Beltsville ( although in 1961 the name used for the transmitter location would be changed to Greenbelt , Maryland ) . WWV resumed normal broadcasts on 2.5 , 5 , 10 , and 15 MHz on August 1 , 1943 . = = = Time signals = = = WWV 's primary purpose today ( and for most of its existence ) is to disseminate the \" official U.S. time \" ( provided by government entities such as NIST and USNO ) to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world . The time signals generated by WWV allow time-keeping devices such as radio-controlled clocks to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment . These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations - these include shipping , transport , technology , research , education , military , public safety and telecommunications . It is of particular importance in broadcasting , whether it be commercial , public , or private interests such as amateur radio operators . WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge ( other than the cost of the receiving equipment itself ) . WWV had been broadcasting second pulses since 1937 , but these pulses were not tied to actual time . In June 1944 , the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO 's clock as a source for its time signals . Over a year later , in October 1945 , WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes . Voice announcements started on January 1 , 1950 , and were broadcast every five minutes . Frequencies of 600 Hz and 440 Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes . By this time , WWV was broadcasting on 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , and 35 MHz . The 30 and 35 MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953 . A binary-coded decimal time code began testing in 1960 , and became permanent in 1961 . This \" NASA time code \" was modulated onto a 1000 Hz audio tone at 100 Hz , sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated \" baaga-bong \" . The code was also described as sounding like a \" buzz-saw \" . On July 1 , 1971 , the time code 's broadcast was changed to the present 100 Hz subcarrier , which is inaudible when using a normal radio ( but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder ) . WWV moved to its present location near Fort Collins on December 1 , 1966 , enabling better reception of its signal throughout the continental United States . WWVB signed on in that location three years earlier . In April 1967 , WWV stopped using the local time of the transmitter site ( Eastern Time until 1966 , and Mountain Time afterwards ) and switched to broadcasting Greenwich Mean Time or GMT . The station switched again , to Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) , in 1974 . The 20 and 25 MHz broadcasts were discontinued in 1977 , but the 20 MHz broadcast was reinstated the next year . As of April 4 , 2014 , the 25 MHz signal has been back on the air in an ' experimental ' mode . The voice used on WWV was that of Don Elliott Heald until August 13 , 1991 , when equipment changes required rerecording the announcer 's voice . The one used at that time was that of John Doyle , but was soon switched to the voice of KSFO morning host Lee Rodgers . The radio signals of WWV , WWVB and WWVH , along with the atomic clocks that their time signals derive from , are maintained by NIST 's Time and Frequency Division , which is based in nearby Boulder , Colorado . The Time and Frequency Division is part of the NIST 's Physics Laboratory , based in Gaithersburg , Maryland . NIST 's predecessor , the National Bureau of Standards , previously maintained WWV as a part of the Department of Agriculture ; NIST is currently part of the Department of Commerce . = = = WWV and Sputnik = = = WWV 's 20 MHz signal was used for a unique purpose in 1958 : to track the disintegration of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft 's onboard electronics failed . Dr. John D. Kraus , a professor at Ohio State University , knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake a small amount of ionized air . This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth , strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds . This effect is known as meteor scatter . Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect , but on a larger scale . His prediction was correct ; WWV 's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute . In addition , the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik 's last orbits . Using this information , Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik 's disintegration . In particular , he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit ; instead , the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth . = = = Call Sign = = = WWV is one of a small number of radio stations west of the Mississippi River with a call sign beginning with W. The W call sign stems from the station 's early locations in D.C. and Maryland \u2014 the call sign was maintained when the federal government moved the station to Colorado \u2014 and the fact that WWV , being a government station , does not fall within the FCC 's jurisdiction with respect to call signs . How and why the call sign WWV was assigned to the time signal station are not known . However FCC regulations do dictate that time stations are to be issued call signs beginning with \" WWV \" . = = Broadcast format = = On top of the standard carrier frequencies , WWV carries additional information using standard double-sideband amplitude modulation . WWV 's transmissions follow a regular pattern repeating each minute . They are coordinated with its sister station WWVH to limit interference between them . Because they are so similar , both are described here . = = = Date and time = = = WWV transmits the date and exact time as follows : English-language voice announcements of time . Binary-coded decimal time code of date and time , transmitted as varying length pulses of 100 Hz tone , one bit per second . In both cases the transmitted time is given in Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) . = = = Per-second ticks and minute markers = = = WWV transmits audio \" ticks \" once per second , to allow for accurate manual clock synchronization . These ticks are always transmitted , even during voice announcements and silent periods . Each tick begins on the second , lasts 5 ms and consists of 5 cycles of a 1000 Hz sine wave . To make the tick stand out more , all other signals are suppressed for 40 ms , from 10 ms before the second until 30 ms after ( 25 ms after the tick ) . As an exception , no tick ( and no silent interval ) is transmitted at 29 or 59 seconds past the minute . In the event of a leap second , no tick is transmitted during second 60 of the minute , either . On the minute , the tick is extended to a 0.8 second long beep , followed by 0.2 s of silence . On the hour , this minute pulse is transmitted at 1500 Hz rather than 1000 . The beginning of the tone corresponds to the start of the minute . Between seconds one and sixteen inclusive past the minute , the current difference between UTC and UT1 is transmitted by doubling some of the once-per-second ticks , transmitting a second tick 100 ms after the first . ( The second tick preempts other transmissions , but does not get a silent zone . ) The absolute value of this difference , in tenths of a second , is determined by the number of doubled ticks . The sign is determined by the position : If the doubled ticks begin at second one , UT1 is ahead of UTC ; if they begin at second nine , UT1 is behind UTC . WWVH transmits similar 5 ms ticks , but they are sent as 6 cycles of 1200 Hz . The minute beep is also 1200 Hz , except on the hour when it is 1500 Hz . The ticks and minute tones are transmitted at 100 % modulation ( 0 dBFS ) . = = = Voice time announcements = = = Voice announcements of time of day are made at the end of every minute , giving the time of the following minute beep . The format for the voice announcement is , \" At the tone , X hours , Y minute ( s ) , Coordinated Universal Time . \" The announcement is in a male voice and begins 7.5 seconds before the minute tone . WWVH makes an identical time announcement , starting 15 seconds before the minute tone , in a female voice . When voice announcements were first instituted , they were phrased as follows : \" National Bureau of Standards , WWV ; when the tone returns , [ time ] Eastern Standard Time . \" After the 1967 switch to UTC , the announcement changed to \" National Bureau of Standards , WWV , Fort Collins , Colorado ; next tone begins at X hours , Y minute ( s ) , Greenwich Mean Time . \" However , this format would be short-lived . The announcement was changed again to the current format in 1971 . Voice time announcements are sent at 75 % modulation , i.e. the carrier varies between 25 % and 175 % of nominal power . = = = Standard frequencies = = = WWV and WWVH transmit 44 seconds of audio tone in most minutes . It begins after the 1-second minute mark and continues until the beginning of the WWVH time announcement 45 seconds after the minute . Even minutes ( except for minute 2 ) transmit 500 Hz , while 600 Hz is heard during odd minutes . The tone is interrupted for 40 ms each second by the second ticks . WWVH is similar , but exchanges the two tones : 600 Hz during even minutes and 500 Hz during odd . WWV also transmits a 440 Hz tone , a pitch commonly used in music ( A440 , the note A above middle C ) during minute : 02 of each hour , except for the first hour of the UTC day . Since the 440 Hz tone is only transmitted once per hour , many chart recorders may use this tone to mark off each hour of the day , and likewise , the omission of the 440 Hz tone once per day can be used to mark off each twenty-four-hour period . WWVH transmits the same tone during minute : 01 of each hour . No tone is transmitted during voice announcements from either WWV or WWVH ; the latter causes WWV to transmit no tone during minutes : 43 \u2013 : 51 ( inclusive ) and minutes : 29 and : 59 of each hour . Likewise , WWVH transmits no tone during minutes : 00 , : 30 , : 08 \u2013 : 10 and : 14 \u2013 : 19 . Audio tones and other voice announcements are sent at 50 % modulation . = = = Other voice announcements = = = WWV transmits the following 44-second voice announcements ( in lieu of the standard frequency tones ) on an hourly schedule : A station identification at : 00 and : 30 past each hour ; marine storm warnings , provided by the National Weather Service , for the Atlantic Ocean at : 08 and : 09 minutes past , and for the Pacific Ocean at : 10 past ; at : 14 and : 15 past , GPS satellite health reports from the Coast Guard Navigation Center ; at : 18 past , a special \" geophysical alert \" report from NOAA is transmitted , containing information on solar activity and shortwave radio propagation conditions . These particular alerts were to be discontinued on September 6 , 2011 . However , as of June 17 , 2011 , WWV is announcing at : 18 past that the decision has been retracted and that the geophysical alert reports \" will continue for the foreseeable future \" . Additional time slots are normally transmitted as a standard frequency tone , but can be preempted by voice messages if necessary : At : 04 and : 16 past the hour , NIST broadcasts any announcements regarding a manual change in the operation of WWV and WWVH , such as leap second announcements . These minutes are marked in the broadcast schedule as \" NIST Reserved \" . When not used , a 500 Hz tone is broadcast . Minute 11 is used for additional storm warnings if necessary . If not , a 600 Hz tone is transmitted . WWVH transmits the same information on a different schedule . WWV and WWVH 's voice announcements are timed to avoid crosstalk ; WWV airs dead air when WWVH airs voice announcements , and vice versa . WWVH 's storm warnings cover the area around the Hawaiian islands and the Far East rather than North America . = = = = Digital time code = = = = Time of day is also continuously transmitted using a digital time code , interpretable by radio-controlled clocks . The time code uses a 100 Hz subcarrier of the main signal . That is , it is an additional low-level 100 Hz tone added to the other AM audio signals . This code is similar to , and has the same framework as , the IRIG H time code and the time code that WWVB transmits , except the individual fields of the code are rearranged and are transmitted with the least significant bit sent first . Like the IRIG timecode , the time transmitted is the time of the start of the minute . Also like the IRIG timecode , numeric data ( minute , hour , day of year , and last two digits of year ) are sent in binary-coded decimal ( BCD ) format rather than as simple binary integers : Each decimal digit is sent as two , three , or four bits ( depending on its possible range of values ) . = = = = = Bit encoding = = = = = The 100 Hz subcarrier is transmitted at \u2212 15 dBFS ( 18 % modulation ) beginning at 30 ms from the start of the second ( the first 30 ms are reserved for the seconds tick ) , and then reduced by 15 dB ( to \u2212 30 dBFS , 3 % modulation ) at one of three times within the second . The duration of the high amplitude 100 Hz subcarrier encodes a data bit of 0 , a data bit of 1 , or a \" marker \" , as follows : If the subcarrier is reduced 800 ms past the second , this indicates a \" marker . \" If the subcarrier is reduced 500 ms past the second , this indicates a data bit with value one . If the subcarrier is reduced 200 ms past the second , this indicates a data bit with value zero . A single bit or marker is sent in this way in every second of each minute except the first ( second : 00 ) . The first second of each minute is reserved for the minute marker , previously described . In the diagram above , the red and yellow bars indicate the presence of the 100 Hz subcarrier , with yellow representing the higher strength subcarrier ( \u2212 15 dB referenced to 100 % modulation ) and red the lower strength subcarrier ( \u2212 30 dB referenced to 100 % modulation ) . The widest yellow bars represent the markers , the narrowest represent data bits with value 0 , and those of intermediate width represent data bits with value 1 . = = = = = Interpretation = = = = = It takes one minute to transmit a complete time code . Most of the bits encode UTC time , day of year , year of century , and UT1 correction up to \u00b1 0.7 s . Like the WWVB time code , only the tens and units digits of the year are transmitted ; unlike the WWVB time code , there is no direct indication for leap year . Thus , receivers assuming that year 00 is a leap year ( correct for year 2000 ) will be incorrect in the year 2100 . On the other hand , receivers that assume year 00 is not a leap year will be correct for 2001 through 2399 . The table below shows the interpretation of each bit , with the \" Ex \" column being the values from the example above . The example shown encodes day 86 ( March 27 ) of 2009 , at 21 : 30 : 00 UTC . DUT1 is + 0.3 , so UT1 is 21 : 30 : 00.3 . Daylight Saving Time was not in effect at the previous 00 : 00 UTC ( DST1 = 0 ) , and will not be in effect at the next 00 : 00 UTC ( DST2 = 0 ) . There is no leap second scheduled ( LSW = 0 ) . The day of year normally runs from 1 ( January 1 ) through 365 ( December 31 ) , but in leap years , December 31 would be day 366 , and day 86 would be March 26 instead of March 27 . = = = = = Daylight saving time and leap seconds = = = = = The time code contains three bits announcing daylight saving time ( DST ) changes and imminent leap seconds . Bit : 03 is set near the beginning of the month which is scheduled to end in a leap second . It is cleared when the leap second occurs . Bit : 55 ( DST2 ) is set at UTC midnight just before DST comes into effect . It is cleared at UTC midnight just before standard time resumes . Bit : 02 ( DST1 ) is set at UTC midnight just after DST comes into effect , and cleared at UTC midnight just after standard time resumes . If the DST1 and DST2 bits differ , DST is changing during the current UTC day , at the next 02 : 00 local time . Before the next 02 : 00 local time after that , the bits will be the same . Each change in the DST bits happens at 00 : 00 UTC and so will first be received in the mainland United States between 16 : 00 ( PST ) and 20 : 00 ( EDT ) , depending on local time zone and on whether DST is about to begin or end . A receiver in the Eastern time zone ( UTC \u2212 5 ) must therefore correctly receive the \" DST is changing \" indication within the seven hours before DST begins , and six hours before DST ends , if it is to change the local time display at the correct time . Receivers in the Central , Mountain , and Pacific time zones have one , two , and three more hours of advance notice , respectively . During a leap second , a binary zero is transmitted in the time code ; in this case , the minute will not be preceded by a marker . = = = Levels of modulation = = = The once-per-second \" ticks \" and minute and hour tones are modulated onto the carrier signal at 100 percent , or 0 dBc . The time code and audio tones are modulated at 50 percent , or approximately \u2212 3 dBc , and the maximum modulation level for the voice recordings is 75 percent , or approximately \u2212 1.25 dBc . = = Transmission system = = WWV broadcasts its signal on five transmitters , one per frequency . The transmitters for 2.5 MHz and 20 MHz put out an ERP of 2.5 kW , while those for the other three frequencies use 10 kW of ERP . The experimental 25 MHz signal uses a sixth transmitter , with 2.5 kW of radiated power . Each transmitter is connected to a dedicated antenna , which has a height corresponding to approximately one-half of its signal 's wavelength , and the signal radiation patterns from each antenna are omnidirectional . The top half of each antenna tower contains a quarter-wavelength radiating element , and the bottom half uses nine guy wires , connected to the midpoint of the tower and sloped at one-to-one from the ground \u2014 with a length of <formula> \u2014 as additional radiating elements . = = Half-hourly station identification announcement = = WWV identifies itself twice each hour , at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour . The text of the identification is as follows : WWV accepts reception reports sent to the address mentioned in the station ID , and responds with QSL cards . = = Telephone service = = WWV 's time signal can also be accessed by telephone by calling + 1 ( 303 ) 499-7111 ( Boulder , Colorado ) . An equivalent time service operated by the U.S. Naval Observatory can be accessed by calling + 1 ( 202 ) 762-1401 ( Washington , D.C. ) . Telephone calls are limited to two minutes in length , and the signal is delayed by an average of 30 milliseconds .",

After graduating from Cambridge University in 1987 and working in advertising for three years , Langan joined Granada Television 's drama serials department where she script edited daytime soap operas . From there , she transferred to Granada 's newly created comedy department , where she developed the acclaimed television series Cold Feet , and other one-off comedies . In 2000 , she left Granada to become a freelance producer , and produced the romantic comedy series Rescue Me for the BBC . She returned to Granada in 2002 , where she produced the acclaimed dramas The Deal ( 2003 ) and Dirty Filthy Love ( 2004 ) . She made her feature film production debut on Pierrepoint ( 2005 ) , which got her a Carl Foreman Award nomination at the 60th British Academy Film Awards . Langan also produced The Queen ( 2006 ) for Granada , which won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . In 2006 , Langan became an executive producer at BBC Films , developing features such as The Other Boleyn Girl ( 2008 ) and The Duchess ( 2008 ) . In April 2009 , she was appointed Creative Director of BBC Films , giving her control of a \u00a3 12 million annual budget and which projects are commissioned for development . By 2010 , Langan had led BBC Films to a record 13 nominations at the British Academy Film Awards , which included In the Loop ( 2009 ) , Fish Tank ( 2009 ) and An Education ( 2009 ) . Langan lives in London with her partner , writer Christian Spurrier , and their two children . = = Background = = Christine Langan was born in January 1965 in Edmonton , London , England . Her mother and father , a dinner lady and a bricklayer respectively , already had three children . Growing up , Langan became interested in television production after seeing Lew Grade 's name in the credits of several programmes . She attended a Catholic grammar school and read English at Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge . After graduating from Cambridge University in 1987 , Langan spent three years working as a copywriter for an advertising company . She also contributed film reviews to BBC Radio 2 's Cinema 2 programme . In 1990 , Langan began her career in film production as an assistant developer for Tessa Ross at British Screen . The following year , she responded to an advertisement for a script editor at Granada Television 's drama serials department , located in Manchester . She was hired by David Liddiment , and worked mainly on Granada 's daytime soap operas . = = Career = = = = = Granada comedy = = = In 1993 , Langan returned to London to work for Andy Harries at Granada 's newly created comedy department , where she script-edited September Song , the television adaptation of An Evening with Gary Lineker , and the second series of Rik Mayall Presents . In 1995 , she was associate producer on The Perfect Match , a one-off comedy drama written by former BBC radio producer Mike Bullen . The Perfect Match was broadcast in September 1995 , and shortly afterwards , Harries asked Langan to develop more ideas from Bullen . They devised Cold Feet , another one-off comedy drama based on the love lives of Bullen himself and his friends . Langan produced Cold Feet , guiding Bullen through his script drafts , and hiring Father Ted director Declan Lowney to shoot it . Cold Feet was broadcast in March 1997 as one of four Comedy Premieres on ITV ( two others of which Langan script edited ) . It received poor ratings and little critical reaction . However , in May 1997 , it won the Rose d 'Or at the Montreux International Television Festival . ITV Network Centre commissioned a series of Cold Feet in August , which Langan also produced . For the series , Langan tried to achieve a written and visual style that differed from regular sitcoms by avoiding \" one-liners and quick laughs \" and hiring directors who had done little television work before . Cold Feet premiered as a series in November 1998 , and Langan stayed until the third series in 2000 . She and Bullen received a nomination for the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2000 . Also in 1998 , Langan worked on her first feature film , script editing the Parker Posey-led The Misadventures of Margaret . In 1999 , Langan was made an executive producer in the department . She oversaw several productions , including Passion Killers ( 1999 , starring Ben Miller ) , Safe as Houses ( 2000 , starring Ricky Tomlinson ) , and the pilot episode of David Nicholls ' I Saw You ( 2000 , starring Paul Rhys and Fay Ripley ) . In 2000 , Langan was offered a position at the BBC 's drama department , which had been rearranged that year . The trade magazine Broadcast reported the BBC had made a \" substantial offer \" to her . Granada 's director of programmes Grant Mansfield countered the BBC 's bid by offering Langan the position of deputy controller of drama , operating under Andy Harries , who had recently been appointed controller of the same department . Langan accepted neither offer , and instead became a freelance producer after her contract with Granada expired . As a freelancer , Langan developed three more episodes of I Saw You for Granada . Her only other project was producing David Nicholls ' romantic comedy series Rescue Me with Tiger Aspect Productions for BBC One . As well as producing it , she made her credited directorial debut on the final episode . The six-part series , starring Sally Phillips , was broadcast in 2002 . It was not a ratings success , and the BBC did not commission a second series . = = = Granada drama = = = In September 2002 , Langan signed a new contract to develop new projects at Granada 's combined drama , film and comedy department . Her first production was the romantic comedy television film Watermelon , starring Anna Friel . At the end of 2002 , she began developing Peter Morgan 's The Deal , a dramatisation of the political rise of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . Although initially giving full backing , the ITV network backed out during pre-production . Channel 4 picked up the film from Granada , and it was broadcast in September 2003 . The Deal was presented with the British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama in 2004 . The same year , she produced the one-off drama Dirty Filthy Love , which was also nominated for the BAFTA for Best Single Drama . In 2005 , Langan 's feature debut Pierrepoint was released at major film festivals . Based on the life of British hangman Albert Pierrepoint ( played by Timothy Spall ) , Pierrepoint got Langan a nomination for the Carl Foreman Award for Most Promising Newcomer at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007 . 2006 saw the theatrical release of The Queen , a feature film follow-up to The Deal , that focused on the impact the death of Diana , Princess of Wales had on Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II . Michael Sheen reprised his role as Tony Blair from The Deal , and Helen Mirren played Elizabeth . The film was produced by Granada in co-operation with the ITV network , and was released in late 2006 to critical acclaim . In 2007 , it won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . Of Langan 's work on Pierrepoint and The Queen , a Variety writer said , \" both pics are a tribute to her tactful skill at working with tricky but talented writers and directors to take stories that could easily have been confined to the small screen and give them real cinematic depth and breadth \" . = = = BBC Films = = = In September 2006 , Langan made a low-key departure from Granada to take up a position as an executive producer with BBC Films . Although approached to join BBC Films some years before , only in 2007 did she feel it was the time to \" concentrate more exclusively on film \" . She immediately began overseeing editing work on The Other Boleyn Girl , which was already in post-production . She also began developing The Damned United , a film based on David Peace 's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United A.F.C. in 1974 . The film was adapted by Peter Morgan , executive produced by Andy Harries , and starred Michael Sheen as Clough . On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects , Langan said , \" The reason I return to working with the same people is that you have invested time , energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends \u2014 The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends \" . Following David M. Thompson 's announcement that he would be retiring from the post of head of BBC Films in September 2007 , Langan was widely expected to take over his duties . Confirmation was made the following month when she was appointed Commissioning Editor of the company , taking over the day-to-day duties of BBC Films and reporting to Jane Tranter , the Controller of Fiction at the BBC . When Tranter transferred to a BBC Worldwide position in Los Angeles in 2009 , the BBC decided not to fill the Controller of Fiction vacancy with a single person . Instead , the responsibilities were divided between four people ; Langan became Creative Director of BBC Films , responsible for \" editorial strategy and commissioning \" , and also joined the BBC Fiction board . By 2010 , Langan was overseeing a \u00a3 12 million annual budget at BBC Films , and had executive produced high-profile films such as In the Loop ( Armando Iannucci , 2009 ) , Fish Tank ( Andrea Arnold , 2009 ) , and An Education ( Lone Scherfig , 2009 ) . BBC Films received 13 nomination at the 63rd British Academy Film Awards , described in the London Evening Standard as a record number . In 2010 , Langan also executive produced The Special Relationship \u2014 the final part of Peter Morgan 's \" Blair trilogy \" \u2014 and StreetDance , the first British feature film to be made in 3D . The Guardian recognised Langan 's achievements at BBC Films by ranking her at number 36 in its inaugural Film Power 100 list in September 2010 . Through 2011 , Langan executive produced Ralph Fiennes ' directorial debut Coriolanus , the Marilyn Monroe biopic My Week with Marilyn , and Lynne Ramsay 's adaptation of Lionel Shriver 's novel We Need to Talk About Kevin . The project was in development hell since 2007 until Langan realised BBC Films was trying to get too big a budget to make it with . Ramsay rewrote the script in 2010 to allow a lower budget . = = Filmography = = = = Awards and nominations = =",

She appeared in magazine , newspaper and television advertising , before she made her debut role in the 1984 crime film Once Upon a Time in America . Connelly continued modeling and acting , starring in films such as the 1986 film Labyrinth and the 1991 films Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer . She gained critical acclaim for her work in the 1998 science fiction film Dark City and for her portrayal of Marion Silver in the 2000 drama Requiem for a Dream . In 2002 , Connelly won an Academy Award , a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award for her supporting role as Alicia Nash in Ron Howard 's 2001 biopic A Beautiful Mind . Her later credits include the 2003 Marvel superhero film Hulk where she played Bruce Banner 's true love Betty Ross , the 2005 horror film Dark Water , the 2006 drama Blood Diamond , the 2008 science fiction remake The Day the Earth Stood Still , the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That into You and the 2009 biographical drama Creation . She re-teamed with her Requiem for a Dream director Darren Aronofsky and A Beautiful Mind co-star Russell Crowe for the 2014 biblical epic Noah . Connelly was named Amnesty International Ambassador for Human Rights Education in 2005 . She has been the face of Balenciaga fashion advertisements , as well as for Revlon cosmetics . In 2012 , she was named the first global face of the Shiseido Company . Magazines including Time , Vanity Fair and Esquire , as well as the Los Angeles Times newspaper have included her on their lists of the world 's most beautiful women . = = Early life = = Connelly was born in Cairo , New York , in the Catskill Mountains . She is the daughter of Ilene , an antiques dealer , and Gerard Karl Connelly ( 1941 \u2013 2008 ) , a clothing manufacturer . Her father was Roman Catholic of Irish and Norwegian descent . Her mother was Jewish and was educated at a yeshiva ; Ilene 's family had emigrated from Poland and Russia . Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights , near the Brooklyn Bridge , where she attended Saint Ann 's , a private school specializing in the Arts . Her father suffered from asthma , so the family moved to Woodstock , New York , in 1976 to escape the city smog . Four years later , the family returned to Brooklyn Heights , and Connelly returned to Saint Ann 's . = = Career = = = = = Child modeling and early film appearances = = = When Connelly was 10 years old , an advertising executive friend of her father suggested she audition as a model . Her parents sent a picture of her to the Ford Modeling Agency , which shortly after added her to its roster . Connelly began modeling for print advertisements before moving on to television commercials . In an interview with The Guardian , she revealed that , after having done some modeling , she had no aspirations to become an actor . She appeared on the cover of several issues of Seventeen in 1986 and 1988 . In December 1986 , she recorded two pop songs for the Japanese market : \" Monologue of Love \" and \" Message of Love \" . Connelly sang in phonetic Japanese as she did not speak the language . Her mother started taking her to acting auditions . At once , Connelly was selected for a supporting role as the aspiring dancer and actress Deborah Gelly in Sergio Leone 's 1984 gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America . The role required performing a ballet routine . During the audition , Connelly , who had no ballet training , tried to imitate a ballerina . Her performance , and the similarity of her nose to Elizabeth McGovern 's , who played the character as an adult , convinced the director to cast her . Connelly described the movie as \" an incredibly idyllic introduction to movie-making \" . While Once Upon a Time in America was being filmed , Connelly made her first television appearance , in the episode \" Stranger in Town \" of the British series Tales of the Unexpected . Her first leading role was in Italian giallo-director Dario Argento 's 1985 film Phenomena , as a girl who uses her psychic powers to communicate with insects , in order to pursue the serial killer of students of the Swiss school where she has just enrolled . She next had the lead in the coming-of-age movie Seven Minutes in Heaven , released the same year . Of her early career , she said , \" Before I knew it , [ acting ] became what I did . It was a very peculiar way to grow up , combined with my personality . \" She described feeling like \" a kind of walking puppet \" through her adolescence , without having time alone to deal with the attention her career was generating . = = = 1980s \u2013 1990s = = = Connelly gained public recognition with Jim Henson 's 1986 film Labyrinth with David Bowie , in which she played Sarah , a teenager on a quest to rescue her brother Toby from the world of goblins . Although a disappointment at the box office , the film later became a cult classic . The New York Times , while noting the importance of her part , panned her portrayal : \" Jennifer Connelly as Sarah is unfortunately disappointing . ... She looks right , but she lacks conviction and seems to be reading rehearsed lines that are recited without belief in her goal or real need to accomplish it . \" Two years later , she starred as a ballet student in the Italian film \u00c9toile , and portrayed college student Gabby in Michael Hoffman 's Some Girls . Balancing work and school , she studied English for two years at Yale University in 1988 and 1989 , before transferring to Stanford University in 1990 to study drama . There , she trained with Roy London , Howard Fine and Harold Guskin . Encouraged by her parents to continue with her film career , Connelly left college and returned to the movie industry the same year . In 1990 , Dennis Hopper directed The Hot Spot , in which Connelly played Gloria Harper , a woman being blackmailed . The film was a box office failure but Connelly was praised . Stephen Schaefer wrote for USA Today , \" Anyone looking for proof that little girls do grow up fast in the movies should take a gander at curvaceous Jennifer Connelly [ ... ] in The Hot Spot . Not yet 20 , Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue \" . During an interview with Shaeffer , Connelly commented on her first nude scene : \" The nudity was hard for me and something I thought about ... but it 's not in a sleazy context \" . The same year , director Garry Marshall considered her for the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman , but ultimately felt that she was too young for the part . Connelly 's next film was the 1991 romantic comedy Career Opportunities , starring alongside Frank Whaley . People magazine criticized the film for exploiting Connelly 's body . The marketing included a life-size cardboard cutout showing Whaley watching Connelly ride a mechanical horse , with the caption \" He 's about to have the ride of his life \" . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Connelly said that a Yale professor brought it to her attention and \" ... that wasn 't something I felt all that comfortable about \" . The big-budget Disney film The Rocketeer ( 1991 ) followed later that year , but failed to ignite her career . She played Jenny Blake , the aspiring actress girlfriend of stunt pilot Cliff , \" the Rocketeer \" . New York characterized the movie as \" pallid \" . The review said of her performance , \" Connelly is properly cast ; she has the moist , full-to-the-cheek bones sensuality of the Hollywood starlets of that period , but she 's a little straight \" . She appeared alongside Jason Priestley in the Roy Orbison music video for \" I Drove All Night \" the following year . Connelly next appeared in Of Love and Shadows , a 1994 Argentine-American drama film written and directed by Betty Kaplan starring Antonio Banderas . In 1995 , director John Singleton cast Connelly as a lesbian college student in Higher Learning . She next appeared in the 1996 independent film Far Harbor as Elie , a prominent person in a Hollywood studio who writes a screenplay based on her traumas . It was followed that year by the neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls , which featured the murder of Allison Pond ( Connelly ) , mistress of General Timms ( John Malkovich ) , and the investigation by a group of detectives led by Maxwell Hoover ( Nick Nolte ) . New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond : \" This footage is actually dirty . That is , it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it , but it 's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away \" . About nudity in the movie , Connelly said : \" It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie , because I had always been so careful about nudity , it was very much a part of this character and I couldn 't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn 't work . It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on , I guess \" . She began to appear in small-budget films which did well with critics , such as 1997 's drama Inventing the Abbotts , set in the late 1950s , in which she played the part of Eleanor , one of three daughters of the town millionaire , Lloyd Abbott . About her performance , director Ron Howard said , \" She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity . She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty , and I guess I stored that information in the back of my brain \" . Her next appearance was in the critically acclaimed 1998 science fiction film Dark City , where she played alongside Rufus Sewell , William Hurt , Ian Richardson and Kiefer Sutherland . Connelly portrayed femme fatale Emma , a torch singer whose husband , John Murdoch ( Rufus Sewell ) , suffers from amnesia . As Murdoch is regaining his memories , Emma is kidnapped by Mr. Hand ( Richard O 'Brien ) and The Strangers , who alter her memories and assign her a new identity . Author Sean McMullen wrote , \" Jennifer Connelly is visually splendid as the 1940s femme fatale ( Emma ) . \" The animated drawing of Aladdin was modelled after Tom Cruise and Jasmine was based on Connelly . = = = Early 2000s = = = In 2001 , Ed Harris directed Connelly in the biopic Pollock in which she played Ruth Kligman , Jackson Pollock 's mistress . In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film , Requiem for a Dream , directed by Darren Aronofsky and based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby , Jr . Connelly played Marion Silver , the girlfriend of Harry , played by Jared Leto ; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn . Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop . She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution . Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived . During her time in the apartment , Connelly isolated herself , painted , listened to music that she considered that her character would , designed clothes , and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin . Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery . Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors ' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation . Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives . The critic Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times , \" Ms. Connelly , too , whittled herself down to a new weight class , and it 's her performance that gives the movie weight , since her fall is the most precipitous . By the end , when she curls into a happy fetal ball with a furtive smile on her face , she has come to love her debasement .... Her dank realization is more disturbing than anything in the novel , and Ms. Connelly has never before done anything to prepare us for how good she is here . \" During 2000 , she appeared as Catherine Miller in the FOX drama series The $ treet , about a brokerage house in New York . Also in 2000 , she appeared in Waking the Dead , a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name , playing Sarah Williams , an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees ( Strangely , Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly 's character in Labyrinth ) . Initially , director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress . Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly 's performance in Far Harbor . Gordon later said : \" There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for . \" About her role , Connelly said , \" Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing . I was really trying to make something of the part and threw myself into it , so that meant a lot to me \" . The New York Times described her performance , \" As Sarah , Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period . And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor . \" The script of Ron Howard 's 2001 film A Beautiful Mind , loosely based on Sylvia Nasar 's 1998 biography of the mathematician John Nash , sparked her interest in the project . Connelly was invited to an audition after her agent Risa Shapiro sent the producers a tape with a clip of the yet unreleased Requiem for a Dream . She was cast by the film 's producer , Brian Grazer , as Alicia Nash , the caring and enduring wife of the brilliant , schizophrenic mathematician , played by Russell Crowe . Howard and the producers eventually chose them after being particularly impressed by their screen chemistry . The film was a critical and commercial success , grossing more than US $ 313 million worldwide . Connelly had the chance to meet the real Alicia Nash before starting shooting and learned more about her life . For her portrayal , Connelly earned a Golden Globe , an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress , and a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Supporting Role . Time magazine critic Richard Schickel called her performance \" luminous \" and the actress intelligent and passionate . Roger Ebert wrote , \" ... Jennifer Connelly is luminous as Alicia . Although the showier performance belongs to Crowe , it is Connelly 's complex work , depicting a woman torn by love for and fear of the same man , that elevates the film to a higher level \" . Connelly said afterward , \" [ A Beautiful Mind ] is the film I 'm really proud of and really love . \" A.O. Scott of The New York Times said , \" There is , for one thing , Ms. Connelly , keen and spirited in the underwritten role of a woman who starts out as a math groupie and soon finds herself the helpmeet of a disturbed , difficult man . \" In relation to previous roles , Connelly said : \" There was a period where I felt like I wasn 't quite being considered for the projects that I wanted to work on because maybe people were thinking . ' I 'm not going to cast the girl who was in that movie for this adult project . ' I 've felt for a long time that this is what I want to do so I 'm happy at this point to just take my time and work on projects that I feel really strongly about and the rest of the time just live my life . \" Connelly said that she became interested in Ang Lee 's Hulk ( 2003 ) because of his philosophical perspective on the Marvel Comics superhero . She played Betty Ross , a scientist and the former girlfriend of the main character , Bruce Banner . The film was a moderate success . It was followed the same year by House of Sand and Fog , a drama based on the novel by Andre Dubus III . She portrayed Kathy Nicolo , an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani ( Ben Kingsley ) . After reading the script , Connelly said : \" ( the story is ) moving and beautifully written . I liked the fact that there is no good guy and bad guy . I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable , because life is often like that . \" Producer Michael London said about Connelly 's portrayal : \" I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had . I don 't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace . \" The film received worldwide critical acclaim , with a BBC reporter commenting , \" [ Connelly ] convinces totally as a selfish , desperate and lonely woman who confesses to her brother , ' I just feel lost ' \" . = = = 2005 \u2013 present = = = After a two-year absence from the film scene , Connelly returned in the 2005 horror / psychological thriller Dark Water , which was based on a 2002 Japanese film of the same name . She played Dahlia , a frightened young woman traumatized by her past , who moves with her daughter to an apartment in New York City where paranormal happenings take place . In his review , critic Roger Ebert wrote , \" I cared about the Jennifer Connelly character ; she is not a horror heroine but an actress playing a mother faced with horror . There is a difference , and because of that difference , Dark Water works \" . She played Kathy Adamson in an adaptation of the novel Little Children alongside Kate Winslet , a movie which focuses on the relationship between Sarah Pierce ( played by Winslet ) and Brad Adamson ( Patrick Wilson ) . Connelly co-starred in Blood Diamond opposite Leonardo DiCaprio where she portrayed journalist Maddy Bowen , who is working on exposing the real story behind blood diamonds . New York praised her performance : \" Connelly is such a smart , sane , unhistrionic actress that she almost disguises the fact that her character is a wheeze . \" Both Little Children and Blood Diamond were nominated for multiple Academy Awards . Her next appearance was as Grace in the drama Reservation Road with Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo , a film released in 2007 . After her son dies in a hit-and-run , Grace gradually tries to overcome her grief , while her husband Ethan ( Joaquin Phoenix ) becomes obsessed with discovering who killed him . By her own account , the character she played in the movie proved tougher than any of her previous roles . USA Today 's Susan Wloszczyna commented , \" The strong performances of Jennifer Connelly and Mark Ruffalo ... raise the film above overheated melodrama \" . Parisian fashion house Balenciaga and Revlon cosmetics signed Connelly as the face of their 2008 campaigns . Connelly portrayed astrobiologist Helen Benson alongside Keanu Reeves in the 2008 remake of the 1951 science fiction film The Day The Earth Stood Still . Unlike the original movie , in which Benson was a secretary and her relationship with Klaatu was the focus , the remake featured Benson in a troubled relationship with her stepson , portrayed by Jaden Smith . This was followed by a role in the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That Into You , which also featured Jennifer Aniston and Ginnifer Goodwin . The film was based on the self-help book of the same name . Variety praised her portrayal : \" Despite its layer of darkness Connelly gives a really rich performance as a woman whose principles back her into a corner \" . In 2009 , she appeared in the costume drama biopic Creation , in which she played Emma Darwin , wife of Charles Darwin , opposite her real-life husband Paul Bettany . Set during the writing of On the Origin of Species , the movie depicts Darwin 's struggle with the subject of the book as well as with his wife , who opposed his theories , and their mourning for their daughter Annie . The San Francisco Chronicle wrote , \" Darwin 's wife , a religious woman who disapproved of her husband 's theories , is played by Jennifer Connelly , Bettany 's real-life wife , in the kind of casting that doesn 't always work , but it does here . We believe in the Darwins ' history together , their familiarity and affection . Connelly 's English accent is also as good as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger 's and Gwyneth Paltrow 's . She doesn 't get just the sounds right , but also the music and the attitude \" . She then voiced the character named \" 7 \" , an adventurous warrior in the animated film 9 .

While she was preparing for the role , director Dustin Lance Black requested Connelly 's advice to design the set of Virginia 's house , as well as the selection of the apparel to create the character 's style . She described the film as a \" very different \" and \" very personal \" independent film . According to Cinema Blend , \" Virginia is propped up by a strong central performance , with Connelly doing some of her best work in years \" . In 2011 , Connelly starred in Ron Howard 's comedy The Dilemma with Vince Vaughn . Although the Austin Chronicle 's review noted , \" Vaughn nails it , and his nicely nuanced everyguy performance is aided by the always-excellent Connelly , \" the movie opened to generally negative reviews .

She is one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood . She appeared in forty-nine feature films , and was one of the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood .

In February 1919 Lilian persuaded her husband to take the family back to England to a climate better suited for their ailing daughters . They sailed aboard the SS Siberia Maru to San Francisco , where the family stopped to treat Olivia 's tonsillitis . After Joan developed pneumonia , Lilian decided to remain with her daughters in California , where they eventually settled in the village of Saratoga , 50 miles ( 80 km ) south of San Francisco . Her father abandoned the family and returned to his Japanese housekeeper , who eventually became his second wife . Olivia was raised to appreciate the arts , beginning with ballet lessons at the age of four , and piano lessons a year later . She learned to read before she was six , and her mother , who occasionally taught dramatic art , music , and elocution , had her reciting passages from Shakespeare to strengthen her diction . During this period her younger sister Joan first started calling her \" Livvie \" \u200d \u2014 \u200c a nickname that would last throughout her life . De Havilland entered Saratoga Grammar School in 1922 and did well in her studies . She enjoyed reading , writing poetry , and drawing , and once represented her grammar school in a county spelling bee , coming in second place . In 1923 , Lilian had a new Tudor-style house built at 231 La Paloma Avenue ( now 20250 ) , where the family resided until the early 1930s . In April 1925 , after her divorce was finalized , Lilian married George Milan Fontaine , a department store manager for O. A. Hale & Co. in San Jose . Fontaine was a good provider and respectable businessman , but his strict parenting style generated animosity and later rebellion in both of his new stepdaughters . De Havilland continued her education at Los Gatos High School , near Saratoga in Los Gatos , CA . There she excelled in oratory and field hockey and participated in school plays and the school drama club , eventually becoming the club 's secretary . With plans of becoming a schoolteacher of English and speech , she also attended Notre Dame Convent in Belmont . In 1933 de Havilland made her debut in amateur theatre in Alice in Wonderland , a production of the Saratoga Community Players based on the novel by Lewis Carroll . She also appeared in several school plays , including The Merchant of Venice and Hansel and Gretel . Her passion for drama eventually led to a confrontation with her stepfather , who forbade her from participating in further extracurricular activities . When he learned that she had won the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet in a school fund-raising production of Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice , he gave her an ultimatum to either stay home or not return home . Not wanting to let her school and classmates down , she left home forever , moving in with a family friend . After graduating from high school in 1934 , de Havilland was offered a scholarship to Mills College in Oakland to pursue her chosen career as an English teacher . She was also offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream . That summer , Austrian director Max Reinhardt came to California for a major new production of the same play to premiere at the Hollywood Bowl . After one of Reinhardt 's assistants saw her perform in Saratoga , he offered her the second understudy position for the role of Hermia . One week before the premiere , the understudy Jean Rouverol and lead actress Gloria Stuart both left the project , leaving eighteen-year-old de Havilland to play Hermia . Impressed with her performance , Reinhardt offered her the part in the four-week autumn tour that followed . During that tour , Reinhardt received word that he would direct the Warner Bros. film version of his stage production , and he offered her the film role of Hermia . With her mind still set on becoming a teacher , de Havilland initially wavered , but eventually Reinhardt and executive producer Henry Blanke persuaded her to sign a five-year contract with Warner Bros. on November 12 , 1934 , with a starting salary of two hundred dollars a week . = = Career = = = = = Early films , 1935 \u2013 37 = = = De Havilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream , which was filmed at Warner Bros. studios from December 19 , 1934 , to March 9 , 1935 . During the production , de Havilland picked up film acting techniques from the film 's co-director William Dieterle , and camera techniques from cinematographer Hal Mohr , who was impressed with her questions about his work . By the end of filming , she had learned the effect of lighting and camera angles on how she appeared on screen and how to find her best lighting . Following premieres in New York and Beverly Hills , the film was released on October 30 , 1935 . Despite the publicity campaign , the film generated little enthusiasm with audiences . While the critical response was mixed , de Havilland 's performance was praised by The San Francisco Examiner critic . In his review in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle , Winston Burdett noted that de Havilland \" acts graciously and does greater justice to Shakespeare 's language than anyone else in the cast \" . Two minor comedies followed , Alibi Ike with Joe E. Brown and The Irish in Us with James Cagney . In both films , she played the sweet and charming love interest \u200d \u2014 \u200c a role into which she would later become typecast . After the experience of being a Reinhardt player , de Havilland felt disappointed being assigned these routine heroine roles . In March de Havilland and her mother moved into an apartment at the Chateau des Fleurs at 6626 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood . In July 1935 Warner Bros. paired de Havilland with an unknown Australian actor named Errol Flynn in the swashbuckler film Captain Blood ( 1935 ) . According to film historian Tony Thomas , both actors had \" classic good looks , cultured speaking voices , and a sense of distant aristocracy about them \" . Filmed between August 5 and October 29 , 1935 , Captain Blood gave de Havilland the opportunity to appear in her first costumed historical romance and adventure epic \u200d \u2014 \u200c a genre to which she was well suited , given her beauty and elegance . In the film , she played Arabella Bishop , the niece of a Jamaica plantation owner , who purchases at auction an Irish physician wrongly condemned to servitude . The on-screen chemistry between de Havilland and Flynn was evident from their first scenes together , where clashes between her character 's spirited hauteur and his character 's playful braggadocio did not mask their mutual attraction to each other . Unlike her two previous roles , Arabella is a feisty young woman who knows what she wants and is willing to fight for it . The bantering tone of their exchanges in the film \u200d \u2014 \u200c the healthy give-and-take and mutual respect \u200d \u2014 \u200c became the basis for their on-screen relationship in subsequent films . Captain Blood was released on December 28 , 1935 , and received good reviews and wide public appeal . De Havilland 's performance was singled out in The New York Times and Variety . The film was nominated for four Academy Awards , including Best Picture . The popular success of the film , as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple , led to seven additional collaborations . In 1936 de Havilland appeared in Mervyn LeRoy 's historical period drama Anthony Adverse with Fredric March . Based on the popular novel by Hervey Allen , the film follows the adventures of an orphan raised by a Scottish merchant , whose pursuit of fortune separates him from the innocent peasant girl he loves , marries , and eventually loses . De Havilland played the peasant girl Angela who , after being separated from her slave trader husband , becomes opera star Mademoiselle Georges , the mistress of Napoleon . The film earned six Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture . It also garnered de Havilland good exposure and the opportunity to portray a character as she develops over time . Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune found her later scenes as Mademoiselle Georges \" not very credible \" , but Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times called her \" a winsome Angela \" . That same year , she was reunited with Flynn in Michael Curtiz 's period action film The Charge of the Light Brigade , set during the Crimean War which became a box office success . During the film 's production , de Havilland renegotiated her contract with Warner Bros. and signed a seven-year contract on April 14 , 1936 , with a starting weekly salary of five hundred dollars ( equivalent to $ 8,500 in 2015 ) . Toward the end of the year , twenty-year-old de Havilland and her mother moved to 2337 Nella Vista Avenue in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles . In 1937 de Havilland had her first top billing in Archie Mayo 's comedy Call It a Day , about a middle class English family struggling with the romantic effects of spring fever during the course of a single day . De Havilland played daughter Catherine Hilton , who falls in love with the handsome artist hired to paint her portrait . The film did not do well at the box office and did little to advance her career . She fared better in Mayo 's screwball comedy It 's Love I 'm After with Leslie Howard and Bette Davis . De Havilland played Marcia West , a young debutante and theater fan enamored with a Barrymore-like matinee idol who decides to help the girl 's fianc\u00e9 by pretending to be an abominable cad . The film received good reviews , with Variety calling it \" fresh , clever , excellently directed and produced , and acted by an ensemble that clicks from start to finish \" , and praising de Havilland . That same year , de Havilland made two more period films , beginning with The Great Garrick , a fictional romantic comedy about the eighteenth-century English actor 's encounter with jealous players from the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise who plot to embarrass him on his way to Paris . Wise to their prank , Garrick plays along with the ruse determined to get the last laugh \u200d \u2014 \u200c even on a lovely young aristocrat , de Havilland 's Germaine Dupont , whom he mistakenly believes to be one of the players . With her refined demeanor and diction , de Havilland delivers a performance that is \" lighthearted and thoroughly believable \" , according to Judith Kass . Variety praised the film , calling it \" a production of superlative workmanship \" . Despite the positive reviews , the film did not do as well at the box office . Her final film that year was Michael Curtiz 's romantic drama Gold Is Where You Find It , a film about the late nineteenth century conflict in the Sacramento Valley between gold miners and their hydraulic equipment and farmers whose land is being flooded . De Havilland played the daughter of a farmer , Serena Ferris , who falls in love with the mining engineer responsible for the flooding . The film was released in February 1938 , and was her first appearance in three-strip Technicolor . = = = Movie stardom , 1938 \u2013 40 = = = In September 1937 de Havilland was selected by Warner Bros. studio head Jack L. Warner to play Maid Marian opposite Errol Flynn in The Adventures of Robin Hood ( 1938 ) . The Technicolor production was filmed on location between September 26 , 1937 , and January 14 , 1938 , at Bidwell Park , Busch Gardens , and Lake Sherwood in California . Directed by William Keighley and Michael Curtiz , the film is about the legendary Robin Hood , a Saxon knight who opposes the corrupt and brutal Prince John and his Norman lords while good King Richard is away fighting in the Third Crusade . The King 's ward , Maid Marian , initially opposes Robin but later supports him after learning his true intentions of helping his oppressed people . No mere bystander to events , Marian risks her life to save Robin by providing his men a plan for his escape . As defined by de Havilland , Marian is both a beautiful fairy-tale heroine and a spirited , intelligent woman \" whose actions are governed by her mind as well as her heart \" , according to author Judith Kass . The Adventures of Robin Hood was released on May 14 , 1938 , and was an immediate critical and commercial success , earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture . It went on to become one of the most popular adventure films of the Classical Hollywood era . The popularity of The Adventures of Robin Hood brought de Havilland a new level of fame as a movie star , but this new status was not reflected in her subsequent film assignments at Warner Bros. Her next several roles were more routine and less challenging . In the romantic comedy Four 's a Crowd ( 1938 ) , de Havilland played Lorri Dillingwell , a dizzy rich girl being romanced by a conniving PR man looking to land an account with her eccentric grandfather . In Ray Enright 's romantic comedy Hard to Get ( 1938 ) , she played another dizzy rich girl , Margaret Richards , whose desire to exact revenge on a gas station attendant leads to her own comeuppance . While de Havilland was certainly capable of playing these kinds of characters , her personality was better suited to stronger and more dramatic roles , according to Judith Kass . By this time , de Havilland had serious doubts about her career at Warner Bros. Some film scholars consider 1939 to be the high point of the golden age of Classical Hollywood , producing classics in many genres , including the Western . Warner Bros. produced Michael Curtiz 's sprawling Technicolor adventure Dodge City , Flynn and de Havilland 's first Western film . Set during the American Civil War , the film is about a Texas trailblazer who witnesses the brutal lawlessness of Dodge City , Kansas , and becomes sheriff to clean up the town . De Havilland played Abbie Irving , whose initial hostility towards Flynn 's character Wade Hatton is transformed by events , and the two fall in love \u200d \u2014 \u200c by now a proven formula for their on-screen relationships . Curtiz 's action sequences , Sol Polito 's cinematography , Max Steiner 's expansive film score , and perhaps the \" definitive saloon brawl in movie history \" all contributed to the film 's success . Variety described the film as \" a lusty western , packed with action \" . For de Havilland , playing yet one more supporting love interest in a limited role , Dodge City represented the emotional low point of her career to that point . She later said , \" I was in such a depressed state that I could hardly remember my lines . \" In a letter to a colleague dated November 18 , 1938 , film producer David O. Selznick wrote , \" I would give anything if we had Olivia de Havilland under contract to us so that we could cast her as Melanie . \" The film he was preparing to shoot was Gone with the Wind , and Jack L. Warner was unwilling to lend her out for the project . De Havilland had read the novel , and unlike most other actresses , who wanted the Scarlett O 'Hara role , she wanted to play Melanie Hamilton \u200d \u2014 \u200c a character whose quiet dignity and inner strength she understood and felt she could bring to life on the screen . De Havilland turned to Warner 's wife Anne for help . Warner later recalled , \" Olivia , who had a brain like a computer concealed behind those fawn-like eyes , simply went to my wife and they joined forces to change my mind . \" Warner relented , and de Havilland was signed to the project a few weeks before the start of principal photography on January 26 , 1939 . Set in the American South during the nineteenth century , the film is about the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner in love with the husband of her sister-in-law , Melanie , whose kindness stands in sharp contrast to those around her . According to film historian Tony Thomas , de Havilland 's skillful and subtle performance effectively presents this character of selfless love and quiet strength in a way that keeps her vital and interesting throughout the film . Gone with the Wind had its world premiere in Atlanta , Georgia , on December 15 , 1939 , and was well received . Frank S. Nugent of The Times wrote that de Havilland 's Melanie \" is a gracious , dignified , tender gem of characterization \" , and John C. Flinn , Sr. , in Variety called her \" a standout \" . The film won ten Academy Awards , including Best Picture , and de Havilland received her first nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Melanie was someone different . She had very , deeply feminine qualities ... that I felt were very endangered at that time , and they are from generation to generation , and that somehow they should be kept alive , and ... that 's why I wanted to interpret her role . ... The main thing is that she was always thinking of the other person , and the interesting thing to me is that she was a happy person ... loving , compassionate . Within days of completing her work in Gone with the Wind in June 1939 , de Havilland returned to Warner Bros. and began filming Michael Curtiz 's historical drama The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex with Bette Davis and Errol Flynn . She had hoped her work on Selznick 's prestige picture would lead to first-rate roles at Warner Bros. , but instead she received third billing below the title as the Queen 's lady-in-waiting . In early September she was lent out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for Sam Wood 's romantic caper film Raffles with David Niven , about a high society cricketer and jewel thief . De Havilland would later complain , \" I had nothing to do with that style of film . \" In early 1940 de Havilland refused to appear in several films assigned to her , initiating the first of her suspensions at the studio . She agreed to play in Curtis Bernhardt 's musical comedy drama My Love Came Back with Jeffrey Lynn and Eddie Albert , who played a classical music student turned swing jazz bandleader . De Havilland played violinist Amelia Cornell , whose life becomes complicated by the support of a wealthy sponsor . In his review in The New York Times , Bosley Crowther described the film as \" a featherlight frolic , a rollicking roundelay of deliciously pointed nonsense \" , noting that de Havilland \" plays the part with pace and wit \" . That same year , de Havilland was reunited with Flynn in their seventh film together , Michael Curtiz 's Western adventure Santa Fe Trail , set against the backdrop of abolitionist John Brown 's fanatical anti-slavery attacks in the days leading up to the American Civil War . The mostly fictional story follows West Point cadets J. E. B. Stuart , played by Flynn , and George Armstrong Custer , played by Ronald Reagan , as they make their way west \u200d \u2014 \u200c both vying for the affection of de Havilland 's Kit Carson Halliday . Unlike some of her previous adventure film roles , Kit is a vital , interesting , and confident character who knows her mind and plays a pivotal role in the story . Playing Kit in a provocative , tongue-in-cheek manner , de Havilland creates a character of real substance and dimension , according to Tony Thomas . Following a world premiere on December 13 , 1940 , at the Lensic Theatre in Santa Fe , New Mexico \u200d \u2014 \u200c attended by cast members , reporters , the governor , and over 60,000 fans \u200d \u2014 \u200c Santa Fe Trail went on to become one of the top grossing films of 1940 . De Havilland , who accompanied Flynn on the well-publicized train ride to Santa Fe , did not attend the premiere , having been diagnosed with appendicitis that morning and rushed into surgery . = = = War years , 1941 \u2013 44 = = = Following her emergency surgery , de Havilland began a long period of convalescence in a Los Angeles hospital during which time she rejected several scripts offered to her by Warner Bros. , leading to another suspension . In 1941 she appeared in three commercially successful films , beginning with Raoul Walsh 's romantic comedy The Strawberry Blonde with James Cagney . Set during the Gay Nineties , the story involves a man who marries an outspoken advocate for women 's rights after a rival steals his glamorous \" strawberry blonde \" girlfriend , and later discovers he ended up with a loving and understanding wife . Her performance revealed a growing confidence playing comedic roles , and a real talent for combining the qualities of kindness and love with a refined sense of naughtiness , according to film historian Tony Thomas . The film was a critical and commercial success . In Mitchell Leisen 's romantic drama Hold Back the Dawn with Charles Boyer for Paramount Pictures , de Havilland transitioned to a different type of role for her \u200d \u2014 \u200c an ordinary , decent small-town teacher whose life and sexuality are awakened by a sophisticated European gigolo , whose own life is positively affected by her love . Leisen 's careful direction and guidance appealed to de Havilland \u200d \u2014 \u200c much more than the workmanlike approach of her Warner Bros. directors . Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote , \" Olivia de Havilland plays the school teacher as a woman with romantic fancies whose honesty and pride are her own \u200d \u2014 \u200c and the film 's \u200d \u2014 \u200c chief support . Incidentally , she is excellent . \" Her performance earned de Havilland her second Academy Award nomination \u200d \u2014 \u200c this time for Best Actress . In July 1941 de Havilland was reunited with Errol Flynn for their eighth and final movie together , Raoul Walsh 's Western adventure epic They Died with Their Boots On . The film is loosely based on the courtship and marriage of George Armstrong Custer and Elizabeth \" Libbie \" Bacon . Flynn and de Havilland had a falling out the previous year \u200d \u2014 \u200c mainly over the roles she was being given \u200d \u2014 \u200c and she did not intend to work with him again . Even Flynn acknowledged , \" She was sick to death of playing ' the girl ' and badly wanted a few good roles to show herself and the world that she was a fine actress . \" After she learned from Warner that Flynn had come to his office saying he needed her in the film , de Havilland accepted . Screenwriter Lenore Coffee was brought in to add several romantic scenes , and improve the overall dialogue . The result is a film that includes some of their finest work together . Their last appearance on screen is Custer 's farewell to his wife . \" Errol was quite sensitive , \" de Havilland would later remember , \" I think he knew it would be the last time we worked together . \" Flynn 's final line in that scene would hold special meaning for her : \" Walking through life with you , ma 'am , has been a very gracious thing . \" They Died with Their Boots On was released on November 21 , 1941 , and while some reviewers criticized the film 's historical inaccuracies , most applauded the action sequences , cinematography , and acting . Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times found de Havilland \" altogether captivating \" . The film went on to earn $ 2,550,000 ( equivalent to $ 41,000,000 in 2015 ) , Warner Bros. ' s second biggest money-maker of that year . In 1942 de Havilland appeared in Elliott Nugent 's romantic comedy The Male Animal with Henry Fonda , about an idealistic professor fighting for academic freedom while trying to hold onto his job and his wife Ellen . While her role was not particularly challenging , de Havilland 's delineation of an intelligent , good-natured woman trying to resolve the unsettling circumstances of her life played a major part in the film 's success , according to Tony Thomas . The film was a critical and commercial success , with Bosley Crowther of The Times noting that de Havilland \" concocts a delightfully pliant and saucy character as the wife \" . That year she also appeared in John Huston 's drama In This Our Life with Bette Davis . Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Ellen Glasgow , the story is about two sisters whose lives are destroyed by the anger and jealousy of one of the sisters . Crowther gave the film a negative review , but noted de Havilland 's \" warm and easy performance \" . During production , de Havilland and Huston began a romantic relationship that would last three years . According to de Havilland , one of the few truly satisfying roles she played for Warner Bros. was the title character in Norman Krasna 's romantic comedy Princess O 'Rourke ( 1943 ) with Robert Cummings . Filmed in July and August 1942 , the story is about a European princess in Washington , D.C. , visiting her diplomat uncle , who is trying to find her an American husband . Intent on marrying a man of her own choosing , she boards a plane heading west and ends up falling in love with an American pilot who is unaware of her true identity . The film was released on October 23 , 1943 , and did well at the box office . Bosley Crowther called it \" a film which is in the best tradition of American screen comedy \" , and found de Havilland 's performance \" charming \" . I wanted to do complex roles , like Melanie for example , and Jack Warner saw me as an ing\u00e9nue . I was really restless to portray more developed human beings . Jack never understood this , and ... he would give me roles that really had no character or quality in them . I knew I wouldn 't even be effective . After fulfilling her seven-year Warner Bros. contract in 1943 , de Havilland was informed that six months had been added to her contract for times she had been on suspension . The law then allowed studios to suspend contract players for rejecting a role , and the period of suspension could be added to the contract period . Most contract players accepted this , but a few tried to change the system , including Bette Davis , who mounted an unsuccessful lawsuit against Warner Bros. in the 1930s . On August 23 , 1943 , on the advice of her lawyer , Martin Gang , de Havilland took Warner Bros. to court , citing an existing California labor law that forbade an employer from enforcing a contract against an employee for longer than seven years . In November 1943 the California Superior Court found in de Havilland 's favor , and Warner Bros. immediately appealed . On December 8 , 1944 , the California Court of Appeals for the Second District ruled in her favor . The decision was one of the most significant and far-reaching legal rulings in Hollywood , reducing the power of the studios and extending greater creative freedom to performers . California 's resulting \" seven-year rule \" , also known as Labor Code Section 2855 , is still known today as the De Havilland Law . Her legal victory , which cost her $ 13,000 ( equivalent to $ 170,000 in 2015 ) in legal fees , won de Havilland the respect and admiration of her peers , among them her own sister Joan Fontaine , who later commented , \" Hollywood owes Olivia a great deal . \" Warner Bros. reacted to de Havilland 's lawsuit by circulating a letter to other studios that had the effect of a \" virtual blacklisting \" . As a consequence , de Havilland did not work at a film studio for nearly two years . De Havilland became a naturalized citizen of the United States on November 28 , 1941 . During the war years , she actively sought out ways to express her patriotism and contribute to the war effort . In May 1942 she joined the Hollywood Victory Caravan , a three-week train tour of the country that raised money through the sale of war bonds . Later that year she began attending events at the Hollywood Canteen , meeting and dancing with the troops . In December 1943 de Havilland joined a USO tour that traveled throughout the United States , Alaska , and the South Pacific , visiting wounded soldiers in military hospitals . She earned the respect and admiration of the troops for visiting the isolated islands and battlefronts in the Pacific . She survived flights in damaged aircraft and a bout with viral pneumonia requiring several days ' stay in one of the island barrack hospitals . She would later remember , \" I loved doing the tours because it was a way I could serve my country and contribute to the war effort . \" = = = Vindication and recognition , 1945 \u2013 52 = = = After the California Court of Appeals ruling freed her from her Warner Bros. contract , de Havilland signed a two-picture deal with Paramount Pictures . In June 1945 she began filming Mitchell Leisen 's drama To Each His Own , about an unwed mother who gives up her child for adoption and then spends the rest of her life trying to undo that decision . De Havilland insisted on bringing in Leisen as director , trusting his eye for detail , his empathy for actors , and the way he controlled sentiment in their previous collaboration , Hold Back the Dawn . The role required de Havilland to age nearly thirty years over the course of the film \u200d \u2014 \u200c from an innocent small town girl to a shrewd , ruthless businesswoman devoted to her cosmetics company . While de Havilland never formally studied acting , she did read Stanislavsky 's autobiography My Life in Art and applied one of his \" methods \" for this role . To help her define her character during the four periods of the story , she used a different perfume for each period . She also lowered the pitch of her voice incrementally in each period until it became a mature woman 's voice . Her performance earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1946 \u200d \u2014 \u200c her first Oscar . According to film historian Tony Thomas , the award represented a vindication of her long struggle with Warner Bros. and confirmation of her abilities as an actress . De Havilland 's next two roles were also challenging . In Robert Siodmak 's psychological thriller The Dark Mirror ( 1946 ) , de Havilland played twin sisters Ruth and Terry Collins \u200d \u2014 \u200c one loving and normal , the other psychotic . In addition to the technical problems of showing her as two characters interacting with each other on screen at the same time , de Havilland needed to portray two separate and psychologically opposite people . While the film was not well received by critics \u200d \u2014 \u200c Variety said the film \" gets lost in a maze of psychological gadgets and speculation \" \u200d \u2014 \u200c de Havilland 's performance was praised by Tony Thomas , who called her final scene in the film \" an almost frighteningly convincing piece of acting \" . De Havilland would later state that playing the evil sister haunted her for years . In his review in The Nation , James Agee wrote that \" her playing is thoughtful , quiet , detailed , and well sustained , and since it is founded , as some more talented playing is not , in an unusually healthful-seeming and likable temperament , it is an undivided pleasure to see . \" While appearing in a summer stock production of What Every Woman Knows in Westport , Connecticut \u200d \u2014 \u200c her second professional stage appearance \u200d \u2014 \u200c de Havilland began dating Marcus Goodrich , a Navy veteran , journalist , and author of the 1941 novel Delilah . They were married on August 26 , 1946 . I met a young woman who was very much like Virginia , about the same age and physical description , as well as being a schizophrenic with guilt problems . ... What struck me most of all was the fact that she was rather likable and appealing . It hadn 't occurred to me before that a mental patient could be appealing , and it was that that gave me the key to the performance . De Havilland was also widely praised for her performance as Virginia Cunningham in Anatole Litvak 's drama The Snake Pit ( 1948 ) , one of the first films to attempt a realistic portrayal of mental illness and an important expos\u00e9 of the harsh conditions in state mental hospitals , according to film critic Philip French . Based on a novel by Mary Jane Ward and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck , the film is about a woman placed in a mental institution by her husband to help her recover from a nervous breakdown . Virginia Cunningham was one of the most difficult of all her film roles , requiring significant preparation both mentally and physically \u200d \u2014 \u200c she deliberately lost weight to help create her gaunt appearance on screen . She consulted regularly with psychiatrists hired as consultants for the film , and visited Camarillo State Mental Hospital to research her role and observe the patients . The extreme physical discomfort of the hydrotherapy and simulated electric shock therapy scenes were especially challenging for the slight 5-foot-3-inch ( 160 cm ) actress . In her performance , she conveyed her mental anguish by physically transforming her face with furrowed brow , wild staring eyes , and grimacing mouth . According to author Judith Kass , de Havilland delivered a performance both \" restrained and electric \" , portraying varied and extreme aspects of her character \u200d \u2014 \u200c from a shy young woman to a tormented and disoriented woman . For her performance in The Snake Pit , de Havilland received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress , the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress , and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup . In 1949 de Havilland appeared in William Wyler 's period drama The Heiress ( 1949 ) , the fourth in a string of critically acclaimed performances . After seeing the play on Broadway , de Havilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her . Wyler obliged , loved the play , and with de Havilland 's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights . Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James , the film is about a young na\u00efve woman who falls in love with a young man , over the objections of her emotionally abusive father who suspects the man of being a gold digger . As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn , de Havilland portrays a character 's transformation from a shy trusting innocent to a guarded mature woman over a period of years . Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements , gestures , and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman . Her timid voice , nervous hands , downcast eyes , and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize . Throughout the production , Wyler pressed de Havilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character . In the scene where Catherine returns home after being jilted , the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine 's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script . The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics . For her performance , de Havilland received the New York Film Critics Award , the Golden Globe Award , and the Academy Award for Best Actress \u200d \u2014 \u200c her second Oscar . After giving birth to her first child , Benjamin , on September 27 , 1949 , de Havilland took time off from making films to be with her infant . She turned down the role of Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire , later explaining that becoming a mother was a \" transforming experience \" and that she could not relate to the character . In 1950 her family moved to New York City , where she began rehearsals for a major new stage production of Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet ; it was her lifelong ambition to play Juliet on the stage . The play opened at the Broadhurst Theatre on March 11 , 1951 , to mixed reviews , with some critics believing the thirty-five year old actress was too old for the role . The play closed after forty-five performances . Undaunted , de Havilland accepted the title role in the stage production of George Bernard Shaw 's comedy Candida , which opened at the National Theatre on Broadway in April 1952 . While reviews of the play were mixed , de Havilland 's performance was well received , and following the scheduled thirty-two performances , she went on tour with the company and delivered 323 additional performances , many to sold-out audiences . While de Havilland achieved major accomplishments during this period of her career , her marriage to Goodrich \u200d \u2014 \u200c eighteen years her senior \u200d \u2014 \u200c had grown strained due to his unstable temperament . In August 1952 de Havilland filed for divorce , which became final the following year . = = = New life in Paris , 1953 \u2013 62 = = = Of course the thing that staggers you when you first come to France is the fact that all the French speak French \u200d \u2014 \u200c even the children . Many Americans and Britishers who visit the country never quite adjust to this , and the idea persists that the natives speak the language just to show off or be difficult . In April 1953 , at the invitation of the French government , de Havilland traveled to the Cannes Film Festival , where she met Pierre Galante , an executive editor for the French journal Paris Match . Following a long-distance courtship and the requisite nine-month residency requirement , de Havilland and Galante married on April 2 , 1955 , in the village of Yvoy-le-Marron , and settled together in a three-story house near Bois de Boulogne park in the Rive Droite section of Paris . That same year , de Havilland returned to the screen in Terence Young 's period drama That Lady ( 1955 ) , about a Spanish princess and her unrequited love for King Philip II of Spain , whose respect she earned in her youth after losing an eye in a sword fight defending his honor . According to Tony Thomas , the film uses authentic Spanish locations effectively , but suffers from a convoluted plot and excessive dialogue , and while de Havilland delivered a warm and elegant performance as Ana de Mendoza , the film was disappointing . Following her appearances in the romantic melodrama Not as a Stranger ( 1955 ) and The Ambassador 's Daughter ( 1956 ) \u200d \u2014 \u200c neither of which were successful at the box office \u200d \u2014 \u200c de Havilland gave birth to her second child , Gis\u00e8le Galante , on July 18 , 1956 . De Havilland returned to the screen in 1958 in Michael Curtiz 's Western drama The Proud Rebel , a film about a former Confederate soldier whose wife was killed in the war and whose son lost the ability to speak after witnessing the tragedy . De Havilland played Linnett Moore , a tough yet feminine frontier woman who cares for the boy and comes to love his father . The movie was filmed on location in Utah , where de Havilland learned to hitch and drive a team of horses and handle a gun for her role . The Proud Rebel was released May 28 , 1958 , and was well received by audiences and critics . In his review for The New York Times , A. H. Weiler called the film a \" truly sensitive effort \" and \" heartwarming drama \" , and praised de Havilland 's ability to convey the \" warmth , affection and sturdiness needed in the role \" . One of de Havilland 's most noted performances during this period was in Guy Green 's romantic drama Light in the Piazza ( 1962 ) with Rossano Brazzi . Filmed in Florence and Rome , and based on Elizabeth Spencer 's novel of the same name , the film is about a middle-class American tourist on extended vacation in Italy with her beautiful twenty-six-year-old daughter , who is mentally disabled as a result of a childhood accident . Faced with the prospect of her daughter falling in love with a young Italian , the mother struggles with conflicting emotions about her daughter 's future . De Havilland projects a calm maternal serenity throughout most of the film , only showing glimpses of the worried mother anxious for her child 's happiness . The film was released on February 9 , 1962 , and was well received , with a Hollywood Reporter reviewer calling it \" an uncommon love story ... told with rare delicacy and force \" , and Variety noting that the film \" achieves the rare and delicate balance of artistic beauty , romantic substance , dramatic novelty and commercial appeal \" . Variety singled out de Havilland \u2019 s performance as \" one of great consistency and subtle projection \" . In early 1962 de Havilland traveled to New York and began rehearsals for Garson Kanin 's stage play A Gift of Time . Adapted from the autobiographical book Death of a Man by Lael Tucker Wertenbaker , the play explores the emotionally painful struggle of a housewife forced to deal with the slow death of her husband , played by Henry Fonda . The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway to positive notices , with de Havilland receiving her best reviews as a stage actress . Theater critic Walter Kerr praised her final scene , writing , \" As darkness gathers , the actress gains in stature , taking on the simple and resolute willingness to understand . \" The New York World Telegram and Sun reviewer concluded , \" It is Miss de Havilland who gives the play its unbroken continuity . This distinguished actress reveals Lael as a special and admirable woman . \" She stayed with the production for ninety performances . The year 1962 also saw the publication of de Havilland 's first book , Every Frenchman Has One , a lighthearted account of her often amusing attempts to understand and adapt to French life , manners , and customs . The book sold out its first printing prior to the publication date and went on to become a bestseller . = = = Later films and television , 1963 \u2013 88 = = = In 1964 de Havilland appeared in her last two leading roles in feature films \u200d \u2014 \u200c both psychological thrillers . In Walter Grauman 's Lady in a Cage she played a wealthy poet who gets trapped in her mansion 's elevator and faces the threat of three terrorizing hooligans in her own home . This was the only controversial film in her career \u200d \u2014 \u200c it was banned in England \u200d \u2014 \u200c and critics responded negatively to the graphic violence and cruelty shown on screen . A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called it a \" sordid , if suspenseful , exercise in aimless brutality \" . That same year , de Havilland appeared in Robert Aldrich 's Hush \u2026 Hush , Sweet Charlotte with her close friend Bette Davis . After Joan Crawford left the picture due to illness , Davis had Aldrich fly to Switzerland to persuade a reluctant de Havilland to accept the role of Miriam Deering , a cruel , conniving character hidden behind the charming fa\u00e7ade of a polite and cultured lady . De Havilland 's quiet , restrained performance provided a counterbalance to Davis 's ranting characterization . Film historian Tony Thomas described her performance as \" a subtle piece of acting \" that was \" a vital contribution to the effectiveness of the film \" . The film was well received and earned seven Academy Award nominations . As film roles became more difficult to find \u200d \u2014 \u200c a common problem shared by many Hollywood veterans from her era \u200d \u2014 \u200c de Havilland began working in television dramas , despite her dislike of the networks ' practice of breaking up story lines with commercials . Her first venture into the medium was a teleplay directed by Sam Peckinpah called Noon Wine ( 1966 ) on ABC Stage 67 , a dark tragedy about a farmer 's act of murder that leads to his suicide . The production and her performance as the farmer 's wife Ellie were well received . In 1972 she starred in her first television feature film , The Screaming Woman , about a wealthy woman recovering from a nervous breakdown . In 1979 she appeared in the ABC miniseries Roots : The Next Generations in the role of Mrs. Warner , the wife of a former Confederate officer played by Henry Fonda . The miniseries was seen by an estimated 110 million people \u200d \u2014 \u200c nearly one-third of American homes with television sets . Throughout the 1970s , de Havilland 's film work was limited to smaller supporting roles and cameo appearances . Her last feature film was The Fifth Musketeer ( 1979 ) . During this period , de Havilland began doing speaking engagements in cities across the United States with a talk entitled \" From the City of the Stars to the City of Light \" , a program of personal reminiscences about her life and career . She also attended tributes to Gone with the Wind . In the 1980s , her television work included an Agatha Christie television film Murder Is Easy ( 1982 ) , the television drama The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana ( 1982 ) in which she played The Queen Mother , and the 1986 ABC miniseries North and South , Book II . Her most notable performance of the decade was in the television film Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna ( 1986 ) as Dowager Empress Maria , which earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series , Miniseries or Television Film . In 1988 de Havilland appeared in the HTV romantic television drama The Woman He Loved \u200d \u2014 \u200c it was her final screen performance . = = = Retirement and remembrance , 1989 \u2013 present = = = In retirement , de Havilland remained active in the film community . In 1998 she traveled to New York to help promote a special showing of Gone with the Wind . In 2003 she appeared as a presenter at the 75th Academy Awards . In 2004 Turner Classic Movies produced a retrospective piece called Melanie Remembers in which she was interviewed for the sixty-fifth anniversary of the original release of Gone with the Wind . In June 2006 she made appearances at tributes commemorating her 90th birthday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . On November 17 , 2008 , at the age of 92 , de Havilland received the National Medal of Arts , the highest honor conferred to an individual artist on behalf of the people of the United States . The medal was presented to her by President George W. Bush , who commended her \" for her persuasive and compelling skill as an actress in roles from Shakespeare 's Hermia to Margaret Mitchell 's Melanie . Her independence , integrity , and grace won creative freedom for herself and her fellow film actors . \" The following year , de Havilland narrated the documentary I Remember Better When I Paint ( 2009 ) , a film about the importance of art in the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease . On September 9 , 2010 , de Havilland was appointed a Chevalier ( knight ) of the L\u00e9gion d 'honneur , the highest decoration in France , awarded by French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who told the actress , \" You honor France for having chosen us . \" In February the following year she appeared at the C\u00e9sar Awards in France , where she was greeted with a standing ovation . De Havilland celebrated her 100th birthday on July 1 , 2016 . = = Personal life = = = = = Relationships = = = Although known as one of Hollywood 's most exciting on-screen couples , de Havilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship . Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935 , Flynn was drawn to the nineteen-year-old actress with \" warm brown eyes \" and \" extraordinary charm \" . In turn , de Havilland fell in love with him , but kept her feelings inside , later recalling , \" He never guessed I had a crush on him ... it never occurred to me that he was smitten with me , too . \" Flynn would later write , \" By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade , I was sure that I was in love with her . \" Flynn finally professed his love on March 12 , 1937 , at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles , where they slow danced together to \" Sweet Leilani \" at the hotel 's Cocoanut Grove nightclub . \" I was deeply affected by him , \" she would later remember , \" It was impossible for me not to be . \" The evening ended on a sobering note , however , with de Havilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita , he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed . Flynn reunited with his wife later that year , and de Havilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn . In July 1938 de Havilland began dating business tycoon , aviator , and filmmaker Howard Hughes , who had just completed his record-setting flight around the world in 91 hours . In addition to escorting her about town , he gave the actress her first flying lessons . She would later remember , \" He was a rather shy man ... and yet , in a whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn 't do anything heroic in life , here was this man who was a real hero . \" In December 1939 de Havilland began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart . At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick , the actor 's agent asked Stewart to escort de Havilland to the New York premiere of Gone with the Wind at the Astor Theater on December 19 , 1939 . Over the next few days , Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club . They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles , where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance . According to de Havilland , Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940 , but she felt that he was not ready to settle down . Their relationship ended in late 1941 when de Havilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making In This Our Life . \" John was a very great love of mine \" , she would later admit , \" He was a man I wanted to marry . \" = = = Marriages and children = = = On August 26 , 1946 , she married Marcus Goodrich , a Navy veteran , journalist , and author of the 1941 novel Delilah . The marriage ended in divorce in 1953 . They had one child , Benjamin Goodrich , who was born on December 1 , 1949 . He was diagnosed with Hodgkin 's lymphoma at the age of nineteen , but was able to graduate from the University of Texas . He worked as a statistical analyst for Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in Sunnyvale , California , and as an international banking representative for the Texas Commerce Bank in Houston . He died on October 1 , 1991 , in Paris at the age of forty-one of heart disease brought on by treatments for Hodgkin 's disease , three weeks before the death of his father . On April 2 , 1955 , de Havilland married Pierre Galante , an executive editor for the French journal Paris Match . Her marriage to Galante prompted de Havilland to move to Paris . The couple separated in 1962 but continued to live in the same house for another six years to raise their children together . Galante moved across the street and the two remained close , even after the finalization of the divorce in 1979 . She looked after him during his final bout with lung cancer prior to his death in 1998 . They had one child , Gis\u00e8le Galante , who was born on July 18 , 1956 . After studying law at the Universit\u00e9 de Droit de Nanterre School of Law , she worked as a journalist in France and the United States . Since 1956 , de Havilland has lived in the same three-story house near Bois de Boulogne park in the Rive Droite section of Paris . = = = Religion and politics = = = De Havilland was raised in the Episcopal Church and has remained an Episcopalian throughout her life . After moving to France , she became one of the first women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris , where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings . As recently as 2012 , she was still doing readings on major feast days , including Christmas and Easter . \" It 's a task I love , \" she once said . In describing her preparation for her readings , de Havilland once observed , \" You have to convey the deep meaning , you see , and it has to start with your own faith . But first I always pray . I pray before I start to prepare , as well . In fact , I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene , so this is not so different , in a way . \" De Havilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style . She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gis\u00e8le in the Roman Catholic Church , the faith of the child 's father . As a United States citizen , de Havilland became involved in politics as a way of exercising her civic responsibilities . She campaigned for Franklin D. Roosevelt 's re-election in 1944 . After the war , she joined the Independent Citizens ' Committee of the Arts , Sciences and Professions , a national public policy advocacy group that included Bette Davis , Gregory Peck , and Humphrey Bogart in its Hollywood chapter . In June 1946 she was asked to deliver speeches for the committee that reflected the Communist Party line \u200d \u2014 \u200c the group was later identified as a Communist front organization . Disturbed at seeing a small group of Communist members manipulating the committee , de Havilland removed the pro-Communist material from her speeches and rewrote them to reflect Harry S. Truman 's anti-Communist platform . She later recalled , \" I realized a nucleus of people was controlling the organization without a majority of the members of the board being aware of it . And I knew they had to be Communists . \" She organized a fight to regain control of the committee from its pro-Soviet leadership , but her reform efforts failed . Her resignation from the committee triggered a wave of resignations from eleven other Hollywood figures , including future President Ronald Reagan . In 1958 she was secretly called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and recounted her experiences with the Independent Citizens ' Committee . = = = Sibling rivalry = = = De Havilland and her sister Joan Fontaine are the only siblings to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category . According to biographer Charles Higham , the sisters always had an uneasy relationship , starting in early childhood when Olivia had trouble accepting the idea of having a younger sister , and Joan resenting her mother 's favoritism for her older sister . This tension was made worse by Fontaine 's frequent childhood illnesses , which led to her mother 's overly protective expression , \" Livvie can , Joan can 't . \" Of the two sisters , de Havilland was the first to become an actress , and for several years Fontaine was overshadowed by her accomplishments . When Mervyn LeRoy offered Fontaine a personal contract , her mother told her that Warner Bros. was \" Olivia 's studio \" and that she could not use the name \" de Havilland \" . In 1942 de Havilland and Fontaine were both nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress \u200d \u2014 \u200c de Havilland for Hold Back the Dawn , and Fontaine for Suspicion . When Fontaine 's name was announced as winner , de Havilland reacted graciously saying , \" We 've got it ! \" According to biographer Charles Higham , Fontaine rejected de Havilland 's attempts to congratulate her , and de Havilland was offended and embarrassed . Their relationship was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about de Havilland 's new husband . When she read her sister 's remarks , de Havilland was deeply hurt and waited for an apology that was never offered . The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own , de Havilland was approached backstage by Fontaine who wanted to congratulate her ; de Havilland turned away from her sister . They did not speak to each other for the next five years , and their silence may have caused the estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters , who secretly maintained a relationship with de Havilland . Following her divorce from Goodrich , de Havilland resumed contact with her sister , coming to her apartment in New York and spending Christmas together there in 1961 . The final break between the sisters occurred in 1975 from a disagreement over their mother 's cancer treatment \u200d \u2014 \u200c de Havilland wanted to consult other doctors and supported exploratory surgery ; Fontaine disagreed . Fontaine also claimed that de Havilland did not notify her of their mother 's death while she was touring with a play \u200d \u2014 \u200c de Havilland in fact had sent a telegram , which took two weeks to reach her sister . The sibling feud ended with Fontaine 's death on December 15 , 2013 . The following day , de Havilland released a statement saying she was \" shocked and saddened \" by the news . = = Career assessment and legacy = = De Havilland 's career spanned fifty-three years , from 1935 to 1988 . During that time , she appeared in forty-nine feature films , and was one of the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood . She began her career playing demure ing\u00e9nues opposite popular male stars , including Errol Flynn , with whom she made her breakout film Captain Blood in 1935 . They would go on to make seven more feature films together , and became one of Hollywood 's most popular romantic on-screen pairings . Her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres . Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night 's Dream , de Havilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies , such as The Great Garrick and Hard to Get , and Western adventure films , such as Dodge City and Santa Fe Trail . Her natural beauty and refined acting style made her particularly effective in historical period dramas , such as Anthony Adverse , The Adventures of Robin Hood , Gone with the Wind , and The Heiress , and romantic dramas , such as Hold Back the Dawn and To Each His Own . In her later career , she was most successful in drama films , such as In This Our Life and Light in the Piazza , and psychological dramas playing unglamorous characters in films such as The Dark Mirror , The Snake Pit , and Hush ... Hush , Sweet Charlotte . During her career , de Havilland won two Academy Awards ( To Each His Own and The Heiress ) , two Golden Globe Awards ( The Heiress and Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna ) , two New York Film Critics Circle Awards ( The Snake Pit and The Heiress ) , the National Board of Review Award and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup ( The Snake Pit ) , and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination ( Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna ) . For her contributions to the motion picture industry , de Havilland received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6762 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8 , 1960 . Since her retirement in 1988 , her lifetime contribution to the arts has been honored on two continents . In 1998 she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Hertfordshire in England . In 2006 , she was inducted into the Online Film & Television Association Award Film Hall of Fame . On November 17 , 2008 , President George W. Bush presented de Havilland the National Medal of Arts , the highest honor given for achievement in the arts conferred to an individual artist on behalf of the American people .

                    "text": "Daphne Clarke = Daphne Rose Clarke ( previously Lawrence ) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours , played by Elaine Smith . Daphne was created by Reg Watson as one of Neighbours ' twelve original characters . The producer had originally wanted Rebecca Gibney to play the role , but she joined the cast of another television series . When Smith came in to audition for a guest part , her appearance , particularly her short haircut , caught the attention of the casting director , who had been looking for an \" outrageous image \" for the character of Daphne . Smith won the role and she made her on-screen debut in the soap 's first episode , which was broadcast on 18 March 1985 . Daphne was portrayed as a smart , confident and independent woman from a good background . She sported a short haircut and bright clothing , which made her stand out from the other female characters on television at the time . Daphne was not embarrassed by her profession as a stripper and her \" no-nonsense approach \" to life made her an immediate favourite with the viewers . Daphne gave up stripping when her grandfather gave her the lease to the local coffee shop . She used her position to help customers with their problems and gained the trust of many of the teenage characters , particularly Mike Young ( Guy Pearce ) . Daphne 's marriage to Des Clarke ( Paul Keane ) was central to many of her storylines . After a brief relationship with Shane Ramsay ( Peter O 'Brien ) and two engagements , Daphne married Des in July 1986 . She gave birth to their son , Jamie ( S.J. Dey ) , in July 1987 . That same year , Smith announced her departure from Neighbours . Not wanting to kill off a popular character , the producers sent Daphne to care for her dying father . However , viewers were not satisfied with this ending and Smith returned to conclude Daphne 's storyline . The actress asked for Daphne to be killed-off and the producers agreed . She made her final appearance on 25 March 1988 , becoming the first regular character to die . = = Creation and casting = = Daphne is one of the twelve original characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours , Reg Watson . When it came to casting , Waston had initially wanted actress Rebecca Gibney to play the role . However , she joined the cast of children 's television series Zoo Family instead . Elaine Smith had previously made several small appearances in various established television series . In 1984 , she came in to Neighbours to audition for a guest role and her short , spiky haircut caught the attention of the casting director . Smith told Hilary Kingsley , author of Soap Box , \" The casting director of Neighbours was looking some outrageous image for Daphne , this stripper \u2013 he didn 't quite know what , but my haircut was it ! \" Smith revealed that the idea of playing a stripper amused her and quipped that Daphne was the only stripper who never had to take her clothes off . = = Development = = = = = Characterisation = = = The character of Daphne was introduced to Neighbours as a \" saucy stripper with a heart of gold . \" In their 1989 book , The Neighbours Factfile , Neil Wallis and Dave Hogan wrote that Daphne came from a rich , but uncaring family . They were rarely mentioned on-screen , making her past somewhat of a mystery . Daphne had received a good education and worked in an office as a secretary , until she told her sexist boss to \" jump in a lake . \" Daphne then chose to become a stripper rather than ask her mother , Tina ( Beverley Dunn ) , for a loan . Of Daphne 's profession as a stripper , Smith explained \" The whole point of Daphne being a stripper is that she 's completely counter to the black stockings and garters cliche . She 's a bright girl from a good background who gets fed up with being ogled and pinched by men in her secretarial job and says , right I might as well make some money out of it . \" With her spiky hair and bright clothing , Daphne stood out from other female characters on television at the time . She was portrayed as a strong , smart and independent woman . She was often shrewd and \" a warm friend \" to those around her . Tony Johnston , author of Neighbours : 20 years of Ramsay Street stated that Daphne had \" an appealing mix of cheek , savvy and the-girl-next-door . \" She was a woman in charge of her own life , which helped her to become the serial 's first \" sweetheart . \" Smith told Kingsley that her favourite aspects of Daphne 's personality were her confidence and stubborn streak . Smith also commented that Daphne wore \" zanier clothes \" than she did and was more outgoing . The fact that she embodied a \" no-nonsense approach \" to life and was not embarrassed by her profession as a stripper , meant Daphne became an immediate favourite with viewers . The way she treated the serial 's teenagers as adults also endeared her to the younger viewers . Daphne gave up her career as a stripper to run the coffee shop , which her grandfather Harry Henderson ( Johnny Lockwood ) gave to her , after he won it in a poker game . Kingsley commented that Daphne ran the business like \" a pro \" . Daphne 's position in the coffee shop meant that customers often confided in her and she helped mediate between several parents and their children . She also gained the trust and affection of the teenage characters , most notably Mike Young ( Guy Pearce ) , who she took under her wing , later becoming his legal guardian . = = = Marriage to Des = = = The first episode of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke 's ( Paul Keane ) bucks party . When the night was interrupted by a neighbour , Daphne left some belongings behind and returned the following morning to collect them . Des 's fianc\u00e9e assumed she had spent the night and called the wedding off . Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off , Daphne moved in . Des was instantly attracted to Daphne , but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her . Josephine Monroe , author of Neighbours : The First 10 Years , wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne , but it was Shane Ramsay ( Peter O 'Brien ) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship . During Neighbours ' first season finale in 1985 , Daphne broke up with Shane and proposed to Des , who accepted . However , on the day of their wedding , Daphne 's bridal car was hijacked by a bank robber and she was late to the church . Having been stood up five times in the past , Des gave up waiting and left . The couple failed to sort out what had happened and their relationship ended . Daphne rekindled her romance with Shane and they became engaged , but Daphne became worried about rushing into marriage on the rebound and they eventually ended their engagement . Following advice and encouragement from his mother , Eileen ( Myra De Groot ) , and friend , Clive ( Geoff Paine ) , Des tried to \" woo Daphne back . \" In June 1986 , Stephen Cook from TV Week announced that Daphne would accept a proposal from either Des or Shane , which would definitely result in her getting married . Smith told Cook \" I don 't know whether Daphne actually needs a man in her life but she 's certainly got two men there . It 's a triangle that 's developed , but to try and give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible . \" Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane and that she had a great deal of love for him . On the other hand , Daphne also loved Des , who she trusted and had become good friends with . O 'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned , Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des . Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne , Des had always loved her . He added \" It was love at first sight for Des . \" Cook later revealed that it was Des who would propose to and marry Daphne . The wedding episodes were broadcast in July and Cook quipped that from the moment Daphne moved into Ramsay Street , there had always been a feeling that she and Des would eventually marry . Despite Shane having once been Des 's \" rival in romance \" , he acted as best man . Cook added that the wedding , which saw most of the regular cast on-set , was \" no small affair \" . A few months after the wedding , Daphne became pregnant . Her pregnancy lasted over the usual nine months and Smith explained that the producers had stretched it out for longer , so they could tie it into other storylines . Daphne and Des 's son , Jamie ( S.J. Dey ) , arrived in July 1987 and became the first baby to be born in Neighbours . = = = Departure = = = In 1987 , after two and a half years of playing Daphne , Smith decided to leave Neighbours and asked to be written out . She felt that while Daphne had been \" a bit of a challenge at first \" , she felt trapped by her persona . Smith also believed that the role no longer offered her variety and she did not want to stay to be bored , but comfortable . As Daphne was one of Neighbours ' most popular characters , the producers chose not to kill her off . Instead Daphne 's father , Allen ( Neil Fitzpatrick ) , re-entered her life and told her he was dying . Realising that she only had a short time to make her peace with him , Daphne took Jamie and moved away to nurse Allen . Viewers were not satisfied with this ending for the character , especially as it meant Daphne and Des would have to break up , a situation that they would not accept . Smith agreed to return for a few days in 1988 to finish off Daphne 's storyline . This time , the actress asked for her character to be killed off . Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald , \" I wanted Daphne to die . I didn 't want to be stuck in a television series for the rest of my life . I 'd taken Daphne as far as she could go . She 's run the gamut of every life experience she could possibly have . I 'd had enough . \" Daphne was critically injured during a car crash on the way to her father 's funeral and she was left in a coma . Off-screen , representatives from the serial 's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract , but she refused . Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say \" I love you Clarkey \" to Des , before becoming the first regular character to die . = = Storylines = = Daphne is hired to perform at Des Clarke 's buck 's party in Ramsay Street . She returns the following morning to collect her watch and emerges from the bedroom when Des 's fianc\u00e9e , Lorraine ( Antoinette Byron ) , arrives with her parents to call off the wedding .

Daphne contracts meningitis , but she recovers and then learns that she is pregnant . Daphne and Des 's marriage becomes strained when she learns that he has been in contact with Lorraine . The couple eventually talk and Des explains that he had just given Lorraine some financial advice . Mrs. Mangel offers to help Daphne paint the nursery and she is knocked off a ladder by Mike 's pet Labrador , Bouncer , and suffers amnesia . Mrs. Mangel threatens to sue and Des decides to settle out of court , so that Daphne does not become stressed . But when Daphne learns what Des has done , she is angry with him for keeping it from her . During a picnic , Daphne goes into labour and Beverly Marshall ( Lisa Armytage ) delivers her son , Jamie . Daphne briefly suffers from postnatal depression following Jamie 's birth . During Jamie 's christening , Daphne 's mother , Tina , turns up . She and Daphne sit down and talk through their problems and part on speaking terms . Shortly after , Daphne learns that her father is dying . Des persuades her to make things right with Allen . Daphne then decides to nurse her father and she takes Jamie to stay with him . Months later , Gail Robinson ( Fiona Corke ) offers to drive Daphne and Jamie back to Ramsay Street after Allen 's funeral . During the journey , they are involved in a car crash , which leaves Daphne in a coma . Des stays by her side and is holding her hand when she briefly wakes up to tell him that she loves him . Daphne then suffers a cardiac arrest and dies . = = Reception = = Josephine Monroe , author of Neighbours : The First 10 Years , stated that Daphne became one of the most popular and colourful characters to have been in Neighbours . A writer for the BBC 's Neighbours website thought Daphne 's most notable moment was \" Going into labour with Jamie at a riverside picnic . \" Claudia Pattison from mobile network operator Orange branded Des and Daphne one of the most popular couples in the serial 's history , while a Virgin Media writer thought that they had \" one of soapland 's happiest marriages \" . The Sydney Morning Herald 's Michael Idato called them Neighbours ' first supercouple . Mary Fletcher from Inside Soap commented that Des and Daphne 's troubled romance was \" one of Neighbours ' best storylines . \" The couple 's wedding gained a lot of attention in the UK and Terry Wogan even discussed the episode with Rolf Harris on his talk show the day after it aired . Tim Teeman and James Jackson from The Times named Daphne 's death as one of their top 15 most memorable Neighbours moments . They commented \" Like , was that her in the bed or an actress with a Daphne wig ? The romance of Des and Daphne ( Mr Ordinary and the ex-stripper ) was an early Neighbours classic so we felt this one hard \" . A Herald Sun reporter also included Daphne 's death in their list of top ten Neighbours moments . The reporter wrote that Daphne was a popular character during the serial 's peak in 1988 and called Des \" her soulmate \" . They added that her death was watched by millions of viewers in Australia and the UK . Sarah Megginson from SheKnows placed Daphne 's death at number three in her feature on the eight most memorable Neighbours moments . She called the relationship between Daphne and Des \" one of the series ' classic romances . \" She added \" The couple were the first to tie the knot on the show , so when Daphne was fatally hit by a car , Des \u2013 and the Neighbours viewing audience across Australia and the UK \u2013 was suitably devastated . A columnist from NOW said that the moment Daphne dies was \" a tear-jerking moment . \"",

                    "text": "First Strike ( Stargate Atlantis ) = \" First Strike \" is the 60th episode and the third season finale of the science fiction television series Stargate Atlantis . The episode originally aired in Canada on February 5 , 2007 on The Movie Network , and subsequently aired March 14 on Sky One in the United Kingdom , and June 22 on the United States Sci Fi Channel . It was written by executive producer Martin Gero , and directed by Martin Wood . The episode is the first of a three-parter , in which the new Earth ship Apollo arrives at Atlantis to conduct a preemptive strike against the Asurans before they can launch a fleet to attack Earth . \" First Strike \" was a beginning to a new direction for the series . It aired alongside \" Unending \" , the series finale of Stargate SG-1 . At the time it was considered the best episode the producers have done , and featured one of the longest visual effects sequences in the series . The episode earned Stargate Atlantis the strongest ratings since the mid-season hiatus , and was generally well received . = = Plot = = The newest Earth warship , Apollo , arrives at Atlantis . Its commander , Abe Ellis ( Michael Beach ) , informs the Expedition that recon missions have discovered the Asurans building ships on their homeworld , which the IOA believe will be used to attack Earth . As the ships are built from only conventional materials , Apollo has been assigned to destroy them in a preemptive strike , using the new \" Horizon \" weapons delivery system . Apollo successfully carries out the mission over the objections of Weir ( Torri Higginson ) , who feels her authority being increasingly sidelined . Soon after Apollo returns to Atlantis , the Asurans retaliate by launching a Stargate satellite that fires an energy beam , disabling the Apollo before zeroing in on Atlantis . The beam will deplete the city 's shield in just under 30 hours , and with the satellite and its active Stargate over the city , the Expedition cannot evacuate using their own Stargate . McKay ( David Hewlett ) and Zelenka ( David Nykl ) submerge the city to mitigate the effect of the beam , but this only buys them nine more hours before the city is destroyed . Realizing that the only way to save Atlantis is to move the city out of the satellite 's range , McKay and Sheppard ( Joe Flanigan ) decide to use their one Zero Point Module and the geothermal power station found in \" Submersion \" to power the stardrive . Lorne ( Kavan Smith ) and a squadron of F-302s are sent to temporarily block the beam using a large moon fragment , so that shield power can be redirected into the stardrive . However , the beam resumes as the city lifts off , briefly grazing the central tower before the shield can be restored . Weir is severely injured and is taken to the infirmary by Beckett 's replacement , Jennifer Keller ( Jewel Staite ) . Atlantis jumps into hyperspace , but the stardrive unexpectedly shuts down well before they reach their destination . McKay realizes that they are marooned in deep space , with only 24 hours before the shield runs out of power and the city 's occupants are exposed to space . = = Production = = = = = Writing and casting = = = \" First Strike \" first surfaced on September 2006 . It was conceived after the completion of the mid-season two-parter , \" The Return \" , where writer Martin Gero wanted Atlantis leave the planet , but didn 't know how and why it would happen until the episode was written . Gero also wanted Atlantis damaged and drop out of hyperspace into deep space by the end , so the following episode \" Adrift \" would follow . The Stargate satellite was originally meant to be a moon-sized satellite sent to destroy Lantea , but was dropped in favour for the Stargate satellite to destroy Atlantis , since a previous episode \" Echoes \" involved the saving of Lantea , and Brad Wright deemed its proposed destruction inappropriate . The scene where Weir thought her leadership challenged was needed to be written , since there were several instances in past episodes where the military step in as leaders . The scene where Ronon Dex says he needs to learn more science was written to parallel Ronon 's appearance in only a few scenes . Gero also wrote the Fantastic Four into the scene , where Sheppard compared Teyla Emmagan to the Invisible Woman , paralleling the lack of Teyla 's appearance as well . \" First Strike \" introduced Jewel Staite as Jennifer Keller . Staite was originally cast because the producers loved her appearance as Ellia , a Wraith adolescent in season two episode \" Instinct \" . Gero created the character to not take over Carson Beckett , but to fill in for him , and thought it endearing to have Keller uncomfortable in her new position . She was originally meant to be a Canadian character , but because fellow executive producer Paul Mullie thought there were already enough Canadian characters , she was turned into an American instead . The third season saw less of Mitch Pileggi as Colonel Caldwell , commander of the Daedalus , due to other commitments ( including Day Break ) . The writers didn 't want to kill him off , so they chose to introduce a new character instead , which was where the Apollo was introduced , as well as Abe Ellis , the ship 's commander . Gero added a list of actors that would be suitable to play him . When Michael Beach was suggested , the crew decided to go with him . However , Beach wasn 't familiar with the Stargate franchise , and was compelled to join the series by his mother , who was a fan . David Ogden Stiers again guest starred as Oberoth . Stiers actually drove from Los Angeles to Vancouver , though he was only wanted for one scene . A retired Colonel of the United States Air Force and his wife made cameo appearances . = = = Filming = = = The episode was filmed during the end of September / beginning of October , 2006 . One of the first scenes , where Keller talks to Weir was done on one long take . In the middle of the scene , the two entered an Atlantis transporter to another floor . The scene was filmed on the same floor , and during the time on the transporter , around 40 people quickly redecorated the hallway . The first scene Michael Beach appeared in was the conference at the beginning of the episode . Despite his lack of knowledge to the series , Beach still acted the scene in one take , where the writers were convinced at his acting style . Beach also asked several questions about the direction and characteristics of his character . Martin Wood noted that he asked \" all the right questions . \" The scene showing McKay and Zelenka below the horizon was filmed from above by Brad Wright 's request , though Gero and Wood wanted the scene shot horizontally . The one scene featuring Stiers as Oberoth was the conversation between him and Weir , which was filmed on the same large room , only Stiers and Torri Higginson had their back to each other around five to ten feet apart . Three camera angles were used during Lorne 's scene in the F-302 . To save costs , one of the camera angles was operated by Kavan Smith himself , who held it on his lap . Elsewhere , the producers wanted to make the control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it different than any other actions involving the control chair . A stunt towards the end of the episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower . The stunt was not originally approved by the producers . A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence . The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence . During the actual sequence , the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face . = = = Visual effects = = = The episode 's visual effects were produced by Rainmaker Digital Effects . Gero wrote the scene involving the minute long sequence where the Horizon weapon fires from the Apollo to the Asuran homeworld . He made contact with Mark Savela to see if it could be done ; Savela was up to the challenge . The sequence was costly , since the visual effects team had to make a 3D world that would last a minute long to ensure that the sequence followed Gero 's script . The sequences where Atlantis takes off from the bottom of the ocean were stock footage from \" Rising \" , with the shield and beam added on . Another reason to keep the scenes was because the writers liked the scene to be reused . Another visual effect was used to switch Keller 's flag patch from Canadian to American , since the decision to have Keller an American character was made after filming . = = Reception = = \" First Strike \" earned a household rating of 1.5 , representing just below 2 million viewers ; 1.1 million from the 25-54 demographic , and 986,000 from the 18-49 demographic . It was the strongest rating for the series since the 1.6 rating from \" The Return , Part 1 \" . This placed Stargate Atlantis the Sci Fi Channel 's second most viewed series , losing only to Stargate SG-1 's final episode \" Unending \" , which achieved a household rating of 1.7 , representing 2.2 million viewers ; and was placed fifth for Cable television for the day it aired . \" First Strike \" was also given a syndication rating of 0.6 . It also received a fan rating of 9.29 out of 10 , and a GateWorld rating of 3 out of 4 stars . The episode was considered the biggest the producers have done for series at the time . According to Joe Flanigan ( John Sheppard ) , the episode would start a new direction for Atlantis . Jason Van Horn of IGN rated the episode an \" impressive \" 8.2 out of a possible 10 , where the episode was praised for its visual effects and tension after the cliffhanger , which he thought would make the wait for its conclusion in the fourth season \" even harder to handle , \" though surprised to see Beckett 's replacement , Jennifer Keller introduced in this episode , which in Horn 's thought would please the fans of Firefly . Critical Myth rated the episode 9 out of 10 . It was noted for Weir 's struggle to maintain her leadership , which was covered earlier in the series since the introduction of Colonel Caldwell , though the topic should have been covered earlier in the season . Ian Calcutt of HDTV UK noted the although the episode had many parallels with the SG-1 finale , \" First Strike \" made a \" cracking \" finale for the third season of Stargate Atlantis . Brett Love of TV Squad considered the episode a classic season finale , and liked the introductions of Keller and Ellis to the storyline , as well as stating the return of the Asurans as a welcoming one . Brigit Cherry of Total Sci-Fi rated the episode 9 / 10 , commented that though the premise seems simple , the plot was fast-moving and efficient , and appreciated the episode 's visual effects , stating that Atlantis is an \" exceptionally strong Stargate brand in its own right . \"",

The ride is a simulated excursion through the rigorous testing procedures that General Motors uses to evaluate its concept cars , culminating in a high-speed drive around the exterior of the attraction . It closed for refurbishment on April 5 , 2012 and re-opened on December 6 , 2012 . It is now sponsored by the Chevrolet brand rather than General Motors as a whole , who sponsored the attraction from 1999 until the refurbishment . Test Track soft-opened to the public December 19 , 1998 after a long delay due to problems revealed during testing and changes to the ride design which prevented the ride from opening on its original date , May 1997 . Instead , the attraction officially opened on March 17 , 1999 . Test Track replaced World of Motion , though it uses the same ride building . Before the 2012 refurbishment , guests rode in \" test vehicles \" in a GM \" testing facility \" and were taken through a series of assessments to illustrate how automobile prototype evaluations are conducted . The highlight of the attraction was ( and still is ) a speed trial on a track around the exterior of the Test Track building at a top speed of 64.9 miles per hour ( 104.6 km / h ) making it one of the fastest Disney theme park attractions ever built . After the 2012 refurbishment , guests design their own car in the Chevrolet Design Studio . Then they board a \" Sim-Car \" and are taken through the \" digital \" testing ground of the \" SimTrack \" . Throughout the ride , guests see how their designs performed in each individual test . After the ride , guests can see how their car did overall , film a commercial , and race their designs . General Motors is the last-surviving \" original eight \" Epcot sponsor while not counting Communicore and / or Innoventions ( referring to those attractions being built and opened from Epcot 's opening day 1982 until 1989 with Wonders of Life ; General Electric dropped sponsorship for Horizons in 1993 whereas Kraft also permanently terminated their sponsorship for The Land pavilion the same year thus becoming the first companies to drop sponsorship at Epcot . It was then followed by United Technologies when they yanked sponsorship of The Living Seas in 1998 . Metlife followed suit for its Wonders of Life sponsorship in 2001 , followed by both Exxonmobil and AT & T pulling their sponsorship for Universe of Energy and Spaceship Earth in 2004 , respectively . Six years later , in 2010 , Kodak too declined to renew their sponsorship for Journey into Imagination and instead simply letting it permanently lapse owing to that company 's then-bankruptcy phase ) . = = History = = = = = Test Track ( March 1999 \u2013 April 2012 ) = = = World of Motion was an attraction that was located in the current building of Test Track and was sponsored by General Motors . When the sponsorship expired , GM was in the process of conducting lay-offs and cutbacks forcing the company to question whether or not to sign another sponsorship agreement . Upon deciding to sign another agreement , GM wanted Disney to construct a new ride ( in the location of World of Motion ) that focused specifically around their automobiles , rather than the fanciful history of transportation from the pre-historic ( animal transportation ) to modern age ( automobiles , planes , etc . ) previously housed in the space . In 1976 , Disney Imagineers had visited the Milford Proving Ground ( owned by General Motors ) and later made a second trip to the facility and worked with GM to create Test Track . After numerous problems encountered during the construction of the ride , Test Track soft-opened on December 19 , 1998 but didn 't officially open until March 17 , 1999 , nearly 2 years after the original scheduled opening date . After World of Motion had closed on January 2 , 1996 , everything inside the ride building was removed . After , new track was constructed outside of the building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track . Work inside the building also continued at the same time . It was scheduled to open 19 months after World of Motion 's closing , in May 1997 , but after numerous problems rose , the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years . Also , the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble the look of a test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests . Over the course of the construction of Test Track , numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening . One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles could not stand up to the demand of the ride course and speed . This problem was resolved but a second , more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year . In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible , twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed . The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride . One by one , programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once . After these problems were resolved , Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19 , 1998 . The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn 't officially open until March 17 , 1999 . = = = Test Track Presented by Chevrolet ( December 2012 \u2013 present ) = = = On January 6 , 2012 , Disney Parks announced plans to renovate Test Track during the second and third quarters of the year and re-open the ride by fall 2012 . As part of the update , Test Track 's sponsor became General Motors ' Chevrolet marque instead of GM as a whole . The new additions include a pre-show area where guests \" design \" a new car for testing in the Chevrolet Design Center , then they will board Test Track 's existing six-passenger ride vehicles , to be known as \" SimCars \" , to see how their design fares on the Center 's driving course . The experience concludes in a renovated showroom featuring current and future Chevrolet products . Also , the ride vehicles used on the original Test Track , will remain the same but receive new \" skin \" . On April 27 , 2012 , Walt Disney 's social media manager Jennifer Fickley-Baker released a set of concept design photos . Within the photos , it was confirmed that the ride will have 4 main tests : capability , efficiency , responsiveness , and power . The ride closed on April 15 , 2012 and soon later , barriers were placed along all walk-ways leading to either the entrance or exit of the ride . Also , a musical show called \" Test Track All Stars \" has been added in front of the former main entrance to Test Track . The refurbished attraction first opened to guests during a soft opening on December 3 , 2012 . The grand re-opening took place on December 6 , 2012 , and has since received generally mixed-to-negative reviews . = = Ride overview = = = = = 1999 \u2013 2012 = = = = = = = Queue = = = = During the first part of the queue , guests viewed a sample repair and test shop . As guests entered the queue in the welcome center they were shown tests performed on cars and parts before being released . The queue wound by different tests for tires and car doors , an anechoic chamber for radio receivers , and an area for crash test dummies to be tested . At the end of the queue a group of guests would be brought into a briefing room where they were shown automobile testing facilities and examples of tests being performed . The host , Bill McKim ( John Michael Higgins ) told the guests that they would take part in some of these tests and also told the technician Sherrie what tests to set up . Small videos of each test were shown as he spoke . He finally told her to choose one final \" surprise test , \" and a video of a car crashing into a barrier was shown as a door opened for guests to enter the interior queue . = = = = Ride = = = = Upon reaching the end of the second queue , guests were loaded into test cars . Upon dispatching from the loading dock , the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb . Next , the car 's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces , including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones . Next , the car 's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones , knocking many over in the process . The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily . Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference . Then , the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers : a heat chamber , a cold chamber , and a corrosion chamber . The handling of the car was then tested . It climbed a set of hills with blind turns while increasing its speed by 10 % each time . At the top , the car almost crashes into an oncoming semi-truck before swerving out of the way . The car was now brought to the final test shown in the briefing room : the barrier test . The car lined up across from a barrier and began to accelerate towards it . Just before hitting the barrier a series of flashes occurred , where a picture of the guests was taken , and the barrier opened to a track outside . The car took a lap around the building with banked turns and a max speed of 64.9 mph ( 104.6 km / h ) . As the car returned to the loading dock , a thermal scan was taken of the guests and shown on a large screen . Like many Disney attractions , Test Track exited into a themed gift shop featuring merchandise associated with the attraction . Guests could also view and purchase photos taken of their vehicle on the ride or scan their Photopass to view or purchase the photos later . There was also an area where there was a showroom of all new , prototype , or legendary GM vehicles . = = = = Post Show : The Assembly Experience = = = = Experience designer Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts , were commissioned to create the new post show experience entitled : \" The Assembly Experience . \" The Assembly Experience is a walk-through environment , giving guest the illusion that they are on the floor of a vast automotive assembly plant . Automotive doors , seats and engines glide overhead on assembly line chainveyors , while simulated automotive die-press caused the floor to \" rumble \" as each automotive part was pressed . Video monitors provided real GM workers a chance to tell EPCOT visitors how they felt about their products and their work . = = = 2012 \u2013 present = = = = = = = Queue = = = = The first queue uses the same area as the old but is themed to Chevrolet 's Design Studio . Riders pass by two concept cars , the Chevrolet Tru and the Chevrolet EN-V. After , the standby queue leads to a section where a small model car is drawn on through projections while one of Chevrolet 's employees discusses the design process for cars . The standby queue goes by large touchscreens where riders can take tutorials on how to design a car . Once at the front of the queue , riders use their MagicBand , park ticket , or receive a white RFID card called a \" design key \" and wait for a set of doors to open leading into one of the two design studios . Once in the studio , riders have a set amount of time ( that depends on how busy the attraction is ) to design their own \" Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle \" that will be tested on the sim-track . Once the time expires , riders move to the second queue which leads to the boarding area . For Fastpass + riders , the queue goes directly to the main design studios . For single riders , guests use their MagicBand , ticket , or a design key to select a pre-designed car from one of the four performance attributes : Capability , Efficiency , Responsiveness or Power . Once 30 seconds expire , riders move to the same second queue . While waiting to board the sim-cars , all guests must scan their MagicBand , ticket , or design key again at the gate to upload their Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle to the sim-car . = = = = Ride = = = = After riders board the sim-cars and the seat belts are fastened , the car that they designed will undergo four different tests : capability , efficiency , responsiveness , and power . In the capability test the car first connects to OnStar , then accelerates past a rain / snow projection and skids out of control . Next , the continuing path disappears and the sim-car turns around to speed up again . A short time later , the sim-car makes a sharp left turn as a lighting bolt strikes . The car then passes by a futuristic city . Following the capability test , the results of which car designs scored the best in the test are displayed . The sim-car then begins the efficiency test . In the first part , the sim-cars are scanned for \" optimum eco-efficiency \" . The second test performs an aero-dynamic test on the vehicle . Finally , a \" hyper-spectrum imaging \" takes place . Again , after the test is complete , the best scores are displayed . The third test , responsiveness , is next . The sim-car accelerates around hairpin turns with laser-projected trees . It then enters a tunnel to encounter the 18-wheeler from the original version though it is now shown with lasers . When the vehicle exits the tunnel , the results for the responsiveness test are displayed and all of the test icons are displayed . The final test is power where the sim-car stops for a moment then accelerates through flashing purple arches to a wall with the ride 's logo on it leading to the outside portion of the ride . As the sim-car 's speed is increased , it makes a right turn , followed by a wide left , a straight section , and one final long left turn . When the test is complete , the vehicle returns to the loading station where the next riders board . Then , guests use their MagicBand , ticket , or design key that has their Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle that they made in the Design Studio to play games in the \" Chevrolet Showroom . \" There is also a shop located at the exit like the original version of the ride . In the current version , many World of Motion logos can be found throughout the attraction , such as on trash bins , murals , and also the attraction 's main sign .",
