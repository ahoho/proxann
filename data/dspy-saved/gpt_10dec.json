While the party was registered with Elections BC as a provincial party , it also participated in the 2008 federal election , the 2008 municipal election , as well as the 2009 provincial election . The party sought to promote multiculturalism , advocate for rights of ethnic minorities and recent immigrants focusing on employment access , security , health care , education and overall rights and status . It was an advocacy party that sought to politically empower and enable those who do not speak English as a first language to participate in politics . Led by Wei Ping Chen , the party was founded in June 2007 . Chen stood for election in Richmond in the October 2008 federal election , and for mayor of Richmond , British Columbia in the November 2008 municipal election , losing both times . In the May 2009 provincial election the party nominated two candidates , one in Richmond Centre and the other in Richmond East , neither of whom were elected but combined for 818 total votes . = = Background = = The Nation Alliance Party was founded in June 2007 by four people : realtor Wei Ping Chen of Delta , renovator Steven Lian from Surrey , tourism guide Randy Liu from Burnaby , and Simon Fraser University student Locan Wang . Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing , via Australia . He witnessed the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country , and how uninvolved they were in politics . Contrasted to his experience in China , Wei Ping Chen was impressed with the political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party . He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English , would empower those communities to become more politically active . Wei Ping Chen was a candidate in the October 2008 federal election in the Richmond electoral district . However , because the party was not registered with Elections Canada , he ran as an independent . He came in fifth place , with 397 votes ( 0.93 % ) , losing to the Conservative Party 's Alice Wong . In November 2008 , Nation Alliance Party members nominated candidates for the municipal election in Richmond . Wei Ping Chen challenged incumbent Malcolm Brodie for the mayoral position and Kang Chen , Yang Dai , Jiajian Cheung , Jian Liu , and Bai Chen were nominated for councillor positions . Like the federal campaign , they were classified as independents . The latest census at the time reported that 50 % of Richmond 's population was of Chinese descent and their campaign highlighted the language barrier faced by those who did not speak English , for example tax notices were only available in English . They participated in the all-candidate forums that were translated in Cantonese and Mandarin .

While the party did not maintain a full slate of policy positions , its candidates advocated for increasing the number of police in Richmond , especially along the SkyTrain route , protection of green spaces , support for affordable housing , and trade missions with China . They were generally in favour of lower taxes but with more spending on senior services and education .

        "doc": "Bringing Up Baby = Bringing Up Baby is a 1938 American screwball comedy film directed by Howard Hawks , starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant , and released by RKO Radio Pictures . The film tells the story of a paleontologist in a number of predicaments involving a scatterbrained woman and a leopard named Baby . The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde which originally appeared in Collier 's Weekly magazine on April 10 , 1937 . The script was written specifically for Hepburn , and was tailored to her personality . Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938 ; it was over schedule and over budget . Production was frequently delayed due to uncontrollable laughing fits between Hepburn and Grant . Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by her co-star , vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett . A tame leopard was used during the shooting ; its trainer was off-screen with a whip for all its scenes . Although it has a reputation as a flop upon its release , Bringing up Baby was moderately successful in many cities and eventually made a small profit after its re-release in the early 1940s . Shortly after the film 's premiere , Hepburn was infamously labeled box-office poison by the Independent Theatre Owners of America and would not regain her success until The Philadelphia Story two years later . The film 's reputation began to grow during the 1950s , when it was shown on television . Since then , the film has received acclaim from both critics and audience for its zany antics and pratfalls , absurd situations and misunderstandings , perfect sense of comic timing , completely screwball cast , series of lunatic and hare-brained misadventures , disasters , light-hearted surprises and romantic comedy . Nowadays , it is considered one of the greatest films ever made . In 1972 director Peter Bogdanovich filmed a loose remake of the film entitled What 's Up , Doc ? In 1990 Bringing Up Baby was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as \" culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant \" , and it has appeared on a number of greatest-films lists , ranking at 88th on the American Film Institute 's 100 greatest American films of all time list . = = Plot = = David Huxley ( Cary Grant ) is a mild-mannered paleontologist . For the past four years , he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone : the \" intercostal clavicle \" . Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow ( Virginia Walker ) and the need to impress Elizabeth Random ( May Robson ) , who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum . The day before his wedding , David meets Susan Vance ( Katharine Hepburn ) by chance on a golf course . She is a free-spirited young lady , and ( unknown to him at first ) Mrs. Random 's niece . Susan 's brother , Mark , has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby ( Nissa ) to give to their aunt . ( The leopard is native to Africa and Asia but not to South America . ) Susan thinks David is a zoologist ( rather than a paleontologist ) , and persuades David to go to her country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby ( which includes singing \" I Can 't Give You Anything But Love \" to soothe the leopard ) . Complications arise as Susan falls in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage . David finally receives the intercostal clavicle , but Susan 's dog George ( Asta ) steals and buries it . Susan 's aunt , Elizabeth Random , arrives . The dowager is unaware of David 's identity , since Susan has introduced him as \" Mr. Bone \" . Baby and George run off , and Susan and David mistake a dangerous leopard who has escaped from a nearby circus ( also portrayed by Nissa ) for Baby . They are jailed by a befuddled town policeman , Constable Slocum ( Walter Catlett ) , for breaking into the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman ( Fritz Feld ) ( where they had cornered the circus leopard ) . When Slocum does not believe their story , Susan tells him they are members of the \" Leopard Gang \" ; she calls herself \" Swingin ' Door Susie \" , and David \" Jerry the Nipper \" . David fails to convince the constable that Susan makes things up \" from motion pictures she 's seen \" . Eventually , Alexander Peabody ( George Irving ) shows up to verify everyone 's identity . Susan ( who has sneaked out a window ) unwittingly drags the irritated circus leopard into the jail ; David saves her , using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell . Several weeks later , Susan finds David ( who has been jilted by Alice because of her ) working on his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum . After giving him the missing bone ( which she found by trailing George ) , she tells him she has persuaded her aunt to make the large donation . Against his advice , Susan climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him . When the ladder starts swaying from side to side dangerously , she climbs onto the skeleton . Before it collapses , David grabs her hand . Surveying the wreckage of his work , David gives up and admits that he cannot live without her . = = Cast = = = = Production = = = = = Development and writing = = = In March 1937 Howard Hawks signed a contract at RKO for an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling 's \" Gunga Din \" , which had been in pre-production since the previous fall . When RKO was unable to borrow Clark Gable , Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the film and the adaptation of \" Gunga Din \" was delayed , Hawks began looking for a new project . In April 1937 he read a short story by Hagar Wilde in Collier 's magazine called \" Bringing Up Baby \" and immediately wanted to make a film from it , remembering that it made him laugh out loud . RKO bought the screen rights in June for $ 1,004 , and Hawks worked briefly with Wilde on the film 's treatment . Wilde 's short story differed significantly from the film : David and Susan are engaged , he is not a scientist and there is no dinosaur , intercostal clavicle or museum . However , Susan gets a pet panther from her brother Mark to give to their Aunt Elizabeth ; David and Susan must capture the panther in the Connecticut wilderness with the help of Baby 's favorite song , \" I Can 't Give You Anything but Love , Baby \" . Hawks then hired screenwriter Dudley Nichols , best known for his work with director John Ford , for the script ; Wilde would develop the characters and comedic elements of the script , while Nichols would take care of the story and structure . Hawks worked with the two writers during summer 1937 , and they came up with a 202-page script . Wilde and Nichols wrote several drafts together , beginning a romantic relationship and co-authoring the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film Carefree a few months later . The Bringing Up Baby script underwent several changes , and at one point there was an elaborate pie fight , inspired by Mack Sennett films . Major Applegate had an assistant and food taster named Ali ( which was intended to be played by Mischa Auer ) , but this character was replaced with Aloysius Gogarty . The script 's final draft had several scenes in the middle of the film in which David and Susan declare their love for each other which Hawks cut during production . Nichols was instructed to write the film for Hepburn , with whom he had worked on John Ford 's Mary of Scotland in 1936 . Barbara Leaming alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn , and claims that many of the characteristics of Susan and David were based on Hepburn and Ford . Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting , and the film included such members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond , Barry Fitzgerald , D 'Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid . John Ford was a friend of Hawks , and visited the set . The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford . Filming was initially scheduled to begin on September 1 , 1937 and wrap on October 31 , but was delayed for several reasons . Production had to wait until mid-September to clear the rights for \" I Can 't Give You Anything but Love , Baby \" for $ 1,000 . In August Hawks hired gag writers Robert McGowan and Gertrude Purcell for uncredited script rewrites , and McGowan added a scene inspired by the comic strip Professor Dinglehoofer and his Dog in which a dog buries a rare dinosaur bone . RKO paid King Features $ 1,000 to use the idea for the film on September 21 . = = = = Unscripted ad-lib by Grant = = = = It is debated by some whether Bringing Up Baby is the first fictional work ( apart from pornography ) to use the word \" gay \" in a homosexual context . In one scene , Cary Grant 's character is wearing a woman 's marabou-trimmed n\u00e9glig\u00e9e ; when asked why , he replies exasperatedly \" Because I just went gay all of a sudden ! \" ( leaping into the air at the word \" gay \" ) . As the term \" gay \" did not become familiar to the general public until the Stonewall riots in 1969 , it is debated whether the word was used here in its original sense ( meaning \" happy \" ) or is an intentional , joking reference to homosexuality . In the film , the line was an ad-lib by Grant and not in any version of the original script . According to Vito Russo in The Celluloid Closet ( 1981 , revised 1987 ) , the script originally had Grant 's character say \" I ... I suppose you think it 's odd , my wearing this . I realize it looks odd ... I don 't usually ... I mean , I don 't own one of these \" . Russo suggests that this indicates that people in Hollywood ( at least in Grant 's circles ) were familiar with the slang connotations of the word ; however , neither Grant nor anyone involved in the film suggested this . = = = Casting = = = After briefly considering Hawks ' cousin Carole Lombard for the role of Susan Vance , Katharine Hepburn was chosen to play the wealthy New Englander because of her background and similarities to the character . RKO agreed to the casting , but had reservations because of Hepburn 's salary and lack of box-office success for several years . Producer Lou Lusty said , \" You couldn 't even break even if a Hepburn show cost eight hundred grand . \" At first , Hawks and producer Pandro S. Berman could not agree on who to cast in the role of David Huxley . Hawks initially wanted silent-film comedian Harold Lloyd ; Berman rejected Lloyd and Ronald Colman , offering the role to Robert Montgomery , Fredric March and Ray Milland ( all of whom turned it down ) . Hawks ' friend Howard Hughes finally suggested Cary Grant for the role . Grant had just finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth , and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film . Grant then had a non-exclusive , four-picture deal with RKO for $ 50,000 per film , and Grant 's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract , earning him $ 75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving . Grant was initially concerned about being able to play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role , despite the new contract . Hawks built Grant 's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film , instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration . Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character , which he said helped his performance . Hawks obtained character actors Charlie Ruggles on loan from Paramount Pictures for Major Horace Applegate and Barry Fitzgerald on loan from The Mary Pickford Corporation to play gardener Aloysius Gogarty . Hawks cast Virginia Walker as Alice Swallow , David 's fianc\u00e9e ; Walker was under contract to him and later married his brother William Hawks . As Hawks could not find a panther that would work for the film , Baby was changed to a leopard so they could cast the trained leopard Nissa , who had worked in films for eight years , making several B-movies . = = = Filming = = = Shooting began September 23 , 1937 and was scheduled to end November 20 , 1937 on a budget of $ 767,676 . Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan 's apartment , moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes . The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn 's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities . She frequently overacted , trying too hard to be funny , and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her . Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn , showing her that he was funnier when he was serious . Hepburn understood , acted naturally and played herself for the rest of the shoot ; she was so impressed by Catlett 's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film . Most shooting was done at the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley , which was used as Aunt Elizabeth 's estate for interior and exterior scenes . Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot , Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh . The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars ' laughing fits . After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule . During the filming , Hawks would refer to four different versions of the film 's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue . His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film , and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five . Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars ' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors . The terrier George was played by Skippy , known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant ( as Mr. Smith ) in The Awful Truth . The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both played by a trained leopard , Nissa . The big cat was supervised by its trainer , Olga Celeste , who stood by with a whip during shooting . At one point , when Hepburn spun around ( causing her skirt to twirl ) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip . Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard , but Grant was terrified ; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in . Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant 's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks ' difficulty filming a live leopard , and some scenes required rear-screen projection . Hawks and Hepburn had a confrontation one day during shooting . While Hepburn was chatting with a crew member , Hawks yelled \" Quiet ! \" until the only person still talking was Hepburn . When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was looking at her , she asked what was the matter ; Hawks asked her if she was finished imitating a parrot . Hepburn took Hawks aside , telling him never to talk to her like that again since she was old friends with most of the crew . When Hawks ( an older friend of the crew ) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on , Hepburn agreed to behave on set . A variation of this scene , with Grant yelling \" Quiet ! \" , was incorporated into the film . The Westlake Street set was shot at 20th Century Fox Studios . Filming was eventually completed on January 6 , 1938 with the scenes outside Mr. Peabody 's house . RKO producers expressed concerns about the film 's delays and expense , coming 40 days over schedule and $ 330,000 over budget , and also disliked Grant 's glasses and Hepburn 's hair . The film 's final cost was $ 1,096,796.23 , primarily due to overtime clauses in Hawks ' , Grant 's and Hepburn 's contracts . The film 's cost for sets and props was only $ 5,000 over budget , but all actors ( including Nissa and Skippy ) were paid approximately double their initial salaries . Hepburn 's salary rose from $ 72,500 to $ 121,680.50 , Grant 's salary from $ 75,000 to $ 123,437.50 and Hawks ' salary from $ 88,046.25 to $ 202,500 . The director received an additional $ 40,000 to terminate his RKO contract on March 21 , 1938 . = = = Post-production and previews = = = Hawks ' editor , George Hively , cut the film during production and the final prints were made a few days after shooting ended . The first cut of the film ( 10,150 feet long ) was sent to the Hayes Office in mid-January . Despite several double entendres and sexual references it passed the film , overlooking Grant saying he \" went gay \" or Hepburn 's reference to George urinating . The censor 's only objections were to the scene where Hepburn 's dress is torn , and references to politicians ( such as Al Smith and Jim Farley ) . Like all Hawks ' comedies , the film is known for its fast pace ( despite being filmed primarily in long medium shots , with little cross-cutting ) . Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich , \" You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast \" . By February 18 , the film had been cut to 9,204 feet . It had two advance previews in January 1938 , where it received either As or A-pluses on audience-feedback cards . Producer Pandro S. Berman wanted to cut five more minutes , but relented when Hawks , Grant and Cliff Reid objected . At the film 's second preview , the film received rave reviews and RKO expected a hit . The film 's musical score is minimal , primarily Grant and Hepburn singing \" I Can 't Give You Anything But Love , Baby \" . There is incidental music in the Ritz scene , and an arrangement of \" I Can 't Give You Anything But Love , Baby \" during the opening and closing credits by musical director Roy Webb . = = Reception and box office = = The film received good advance reviews ; Otis Ferguson of The New Republic thought the film very funny , praising Hawks ' direction . Variety praised the film , singling out Hawks ' pacing and direction , calling Hepburn 's performance \" one of her most invigorating screen characterizations \" and saying Grant \" performs his role to the hilt \" ; their only criticism was the length of the jail scene . Film Daily called it \" literally a riot from beginning to end , with the laugh total heavy and the action fast . \" Harrison 's Reports called the film \" An excellent farce \" with \" many situations that provoke hearty laughter , \" and John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that both stars \" manage to be funny \" and that Hepburn had never \" seemed so good-natured . \" However , Frank S. Nugent of the New York Times disliked the film , considering it derivative and clich\u00e9-ridden , a rehash of dozens of other screwball comedies of the period . He labeled Hepburn 's performance \" breathless , senseless , and terribly , terribly fatiguing \" , and added , \" If you 've never been to the movies , Bringing Up Baby will be new to you \u2013 a zany-ridden product of the goofy-farce school . But who hasn 't been to the movies ? \" Despite Bringing Up Baby 's reputation as a flop , it was successful in some parts of the U.S. The film premiered on February 16 , 1938 at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco ( where it was a hit ) , and was also successful in Los Angeles , Portland , Denver , Cincinnati and Washington , D.C .. However , it was a financial disappointment in the Midwest , as well as most other cities in the country , including NYC ; to RKO 's chagrin , the film 's premiere in New York on March 3 , 1938 at Radio City Music Hall made only $ 70,000 and it was pulled after one week in favor of Jezebel with Bette Davis . During its first run , Bringing Up Baby made $ 715,000 in the U.S. and $ 394,000 in foreign markets for a total of $ 1,109,000 ; its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an additional $ 95,000 in the US and $ 55,000 in foreign markets . Following its second run , the film made a profit of $ 163,000 . Due to its perceived failure , Hawks was released early from his two-film contract with RKO and Gunga Din was eventually directed by George Stevens . Hawks later said the film \" had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that . There were no normal people in it . Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I learned my lesson and don 't intend ever again to make everybody crazy \" . The director went on to work with RKO on three films over the next decade . Long before Bringing Up Baby 's release , Hepburn had been branded \" box-office poison \" by Harry Brandt ( president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America ) and thus was allowed to buy out her RKO contract for $ 22,000 . However , many critics marveled at her new skill at low comedy ; Life magazine called her \" the surprise of the picture \" . Hepburn 's former boyfriend Howard Hughes bought RKO in 1941 , and sold it in 1959 ; when he sold the company , Hughes retained the copyright to six films ( including Bringing Up Baby ) . = = Legacy = = Bringing Up Baby was the second of four films starring Grant and Hepburn ; the others were Sylvia Scarlett ( 1935 ) , Holiday ( 1938 ) and The Philadelphia Story ( 1940 ) . The film 's concept was described by philosopher Stanley Cavell as a \" definitive achievement in the history of the art of film . \" Cavell noted that Bringing Up Baby was made in a tradition of romantic comedy with inspiration from ancient Rome and Shakespeare . Shakespeare 's Much Ado About Nothing and As You Like It have been cited in particular as an influence on the film and the screwball comedy in general , with their \" haughty , self-sufficient men , strong women and fierce combat of words and wit . \" Hepburn 's character has been cited as an early example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl film archetype . The popularity of Bringing Up Baby has increased since it was shown on television during the 1950s , and by the 1960s film analysts ( including the writers at Cahiers du Cinema in France ) affirmed the film 's quality . In a rebuttal of fellow New York Times critic Nugent 's scathing review of the film at the time of release , A. O. Scott has said that you 'll \" find yourself amazed at its freshness , its vigor , and its brilliance-qualities undiminished after sixty-five years , and likely to withstand repeated viewings . \" Leonard Maltin stated that it is now \" considered the definitive screwball comedy , and one of the fastest , funniest films ever made ; grand performances by all . \" Bringing Up Baby has been adapted several times . Hawks recycled the nightclub scene in which Hepburn 's dress is torn and Grant walks behind her in the 1964 comedy , Man 's Favorite Sport . Peter Bogdanovich 's 1972 film What 's Up , Doc ? , starring Barbra Streisand , was intended as an homage to the film , and has contributed to its reputation . In the commentary track for Bringing Up Baby , Bogdanovich discusses how the coat-ripping scene in What 's Up , Doc ? was based on the scene in which Grant 's coat and Hepburn 's dress are torn in Bringing Up Baby . The 1987 film Who 's That Girl ? , starring Madonna , is also loosely based on Bringing Up Baby . In 1990 ( the registry 's second year ) , Bringing Up Baby was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as \" culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant \" . Entertainment Weekly voted the film 24th on its list of greatest films . In 2000 , readers of Total Film magazine voted it the 47th-greatest comedy film of all time . Premiere ranked Cary Grant 's performance as Dr. David Huxley 68th on its list of 100 all-time greatest performances , and ranked Susan Vance 21st on its list of 100 all-time greatest movie characters . The National Society of Film Critics also included Bringing Up Baby in their \" 100 Essential Films \" , considering it to be arguably the director 's best film . = = = American Film Institute recognition = = = 1998 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies \u2013 # 97 2000 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs \u2013 # 14 2002 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Passions \u2013 # 51 2005 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes : Dr. David Huxley : \" It isn 't that I don 't like you , Susan , because after all , in moments of quiet , I 'm strangely drawn toward you ; but , well , there haven 't been any quiet moments ! \" \u2013 Nominated 2007 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies ( 10th Anniversary Edition ) \u2013 # 88 2008 : AFI 's 10 Top 10 : Nominated Romantic Comedy Film",

        "doc": "Bankers ' Toadies incident = The Bankers ' Toadies incident occurred in 1937 in Alberta , Canada when a pamphlet was discovered advocating the \" extermination \" of nine men identified as \" Bankers ' Toadies \" . The men were opponents of the Social Credit government of Premier William Aberhart , which had been elected on a platform of giving all Albertans monthly dividends ; Aberhart blamed the banking system for his failure to follow through on this pledge . After David Duggan , leader of the Conservative Party and one of the men named , raised his concern over the pamphlet in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta , police raided the Social Credit League 's Edmonton headquarters . Social Credit whip Joe Unwin and Social Credit Board advisor George Frederick Powell were arrested and charged with criminal libel and counselling to murder . Both were convicted of the libel charge , and Justice William Carlos Ives sentenced them to hard labour . = = Background = = William Aberhart 's Social Credit League won a substantial victory in the 1935 Alberta provincial election on the strength of its promise to implement social credit , an economic theory proposed by British engineer C. H. Douglas . Social credit held that the poverty of the Great Depression was in part the fault of bankers , who kept the cost of credit , and by extension of production , high . Aberhart 's solution involved , among other things , monthly \" credit dividends \" to Albertans in the amount of C $ 25 . By 1937 , Aberhart 's failure to implement these dividends or make other progress towards implementing social credit made many of his backbenchers suspect that he was either unwilling or unable to do so . This belief , combined with a suspicion that he did not properly understand Douglas 's theories , led to the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt . One outcome of the revolt was Aberhart 's ceding a number of the government 's powers to the Social Credit Board , made up of five Social Credit backbenchers . Glenville MacLachlan , its chair , travelled to the United Kingdom , where he asked Douglas to come to Alberta and serve as its advisor . Douglas declined , but in his stead sent two of his lieutenants , L. D. Byrne and George Frederick Powell . Part of the Board 's mandate was to educate the public about social credit ; to this end , Powell and Social Credit whip Joseph Unwin were assigned to write educational materials . In response to what they saw as the radically anti-business views of the Aberhart government and the Social Credit Board , Alberta 's mainstream opposition parties \u2014 chiefly the Liberals and the Conservatives \u2014 began to cooperate under the auspices of the newly formed People 's League . = = Leaflet = = In October 1937 , Conservative leader David Duggan rose in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta to draw its attention to a pamphlet distributed in and around the legislature building that called for his \" extermination \" . The front of the leaflet read as follows : My child , you should NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers ' Toadies . God made snakes , slugs , snails and other creepy-crawly , treacherous , and poisonous things . NEVER , therefore , abuse them \u2014 just exterminate them ! And to prevent all evasion demand the RESULT you want \u2014 $ 25.00 a month and a lower cost to live . The back of the pamphlet listed nine men identified as \" toadies \" . Besides Duggan , they were S. W. Field , lawyer and president of the People 's League H. H. Parlee , lawyer and president of the Liberals ' Edmonton constituency association John Lymburn , lawyer , member of the People 's League , and former Attorney-General of Alberta H. R. Milner , lawyer and president of the Conservatives ' Edmonton constituency association G. D. Hunt , investment broker L. Y. Cairns , lawyer , member of the Conservatives ' provincial executive G. W. Auxier , lawyer and secretary of the People 's League William Antrobus Griesbach , lawyer , member of the Canadian Senate , and former member of the Canadian House of Commons and mayor of Edmonton Below this list of names were the words \" Exterminate Them . And to prevent all Evasion , Demand the Result You Want \u2014 $ 25.00 a MONTH and a lower cost to live . \" On October 3 , the police raided the Social Credit League 's Edmonton office and seized 4,000 copies of the pamphlet . Griesbach pressed charges against Powell and Unwin for criminal libel and counselling to murder . = = Trial = = Aberhart , who besides being Premier was Attorney-General , tried to prevent the trial from proceeding by withdrawing the Crown prosecutor assigned to it . Either trial judge William Carlos Ives or a justice of the peace countered by appointing a private prosecutor so the case could go ahead . Both defendants were held on $ 20,000 bail . Both hired lawyers : Powell was represented by Hugh Calais Macdonald , while Unwin retained one R. Jackson . George Steer acted for the prosecution . On October 27 , both men appeared before police magistrate A. H. Gibson for their preliminary hearings on the criminal libel charge ( the counselling to murder charge had been dropped ) . Unwin opted for a jury trial , while Powell elected to be tried by a judge alone . Unwin 's trial proceeded first , on November 12 . He testified that he had ordered the pamphlets , which were paid for by the government , and then circulated them as a publication of the \" United Democrats \" , a fictitious organization that listed its address as that of Unwin 's home . According to Unwin , the leaflet 's text , minus the named individuals , had been provided to him by Powell , he had sent it to the printer 's in exactly that form , and he was surprised to see the list of names in the final version . Though his testimony was vague and apparently evasive , he admitted to destroying 4,000 copies of the leaflet on the day of the police raid . He was convicted and Ives , dismissing his role in the affair as that of an \" errand boy \" , sentenced him to three months hard labour . Powell 's trial proceeded immediately after Unwin 's , and his testimony contradicted much of what Unwin had said . Powell claimed that Unwin had put the list of names on the pamphlet , and that Powell had expected that it would list organizations rather than individuals . Ives found Unwin 's testimony more credible , convicted Powell on November 15 , and sentenced him to six months hard labour . He also recommended that he be deported to his native United Kingdom following his sentence . Appeals by both men against conviction and sentence were unsuccessful . = = Aftermath = = The case attracted considerable media attention and mixed reactions . A Toronto spokesman for the Communist Party of Canada protested the arrests and called for a \" united front \" against the People 's League . Aberhart maintained that the men had been jailed on the basis of some harmless political humour , and encouraged the federal government to grant them clemency ; Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King responded that to do so would be to engage in \" direct interference by the federal executive with the free and proper functioning of our courts \" . Every night , some Social Crediters drove to the Fort Saskatchewan Penitentiary , where the men were being held , to show their support . On February 11 , 1938 , the legislature passed a resolution calling for the men 's release . Douglas reacted to his deputy 's arrest with anger , telling reporters that \" whoever is instigating the proceedings is asking for a great deal of trouble , and is likely to get it . \" On December 10 , 1937 , he wrote King to tell him that he had been invited to come to Alberta to provide advice , and asked if he would be risking arrest and deportation if he did so . King responded that as long as Douglas , unlike Powell , refrained from running afoul of the Criminal Code , he had nothing to fear . At the end of Unwin 's sentence , the Social Credit members of the legislature celebrated with a snake dance . Powell was released early , on March 21 , 1938 , in an attempt by King to bolster his Liberals ' chances in a by-election in Edmonton East the same day ; the by-election was won by Social Crediter Orvis A. Kennedy , and a jubilant celebration followed . Once again , the Communists expressed solidarity with the Social Crediters , with Jan Lakeman thanking the voters for giving \" an overwhelming defeat to the forces of reaction \" . Powell left Canada immediately upon his release , but not before being paid $ 4,000 by the Alberta government as thanks for his services . On August 18 , 1938 , police magistrate A. H. Gibson , who had presided over the prosecution of Unwin and Powell , was dismissed without cause by provincial Order in Council . Gibson believed that his dismissal was due to \" the government 's resentment over my action in the Powell-Unwin case and the fact that they hold me more or less to blame for the fact that the accused men were sent to jail . \" Aberhart 's Social Crediters were re-elected with a reduced majority in the 1940 provincial election ; Aberhart remained premier until his 1943 death . Unwin was defeated in 1940 by Labour candidate Angus James Morrison . Though he lived until January 4 , 1987 , Unwin remains most remembered for his involvement in the Bankers ' Toadies incident .",

        "doc": "Simon Favre = Simon Favre ( May 31 , 1760 \u2013 July 3 , 1813 ) was an interpreter of the Muskogean languages , particularly Choctaw and Chickasaw , for the French , British , Spanish and Americans in the part of West Florida that became part of the states of Mississippi and Alabama . The son of another prominent interpreter , Favre spent the late 18th century in the vicinity of Mobile and the Tombigbee River , which changed hands from French to British , and then Spanish control . He became well versed in the language and culture of the Choctaws , and was involved with several treaties between the Europeans and natives . As a young man he had a Chocktaw mistress with whom he had six known children , then at the age of 41 he was legally married in Mobile to a woman of European descent . Within a few years of his marriage , he moved with his new family from the Tombigbee area to a plantation on the Pearl River . As the power of the Choctaws diminished , Favre became less important as an interpreter , and more important as a facilitator of the political changes occurring along the Gulf Coast . Once the Louisiana Purchase was concluded between France and the United States , American settlers from both inside and outside Spanish West Florida increased pressure on Spain for American control of the territory . While the transfer did not officially take place until 1821 , the Spanish essentially put Florida under the trust of the United States in 1810 , and Favre played a major role in facilitating the transfer , and keeping the Indians informed of the events . Favre was considered the top interpreter in the region by men of prominence , including Governor William C. C. Claiborne of Louisiana who made Favre a justice of the peace , and recommended him for the position of United States agent to the Choctaws . A \" talk \" that Favre gave to the Choctaws on the eve of the War of 1812 was touted by historian Russell Guerin as a masterpiece of diplomacy , and displayed Favre 's deep understanding of the native language and culture . Favre died in 1813 , leaving many minor children and a substantial estate of more than 5000 acres of land and 57 slaves . He had 13 known children with three different women , and leaves numerous descendants . A well-known descendant is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre . Simon Favre 's associations with property owners and prominent officials demonstrate that he was a person of very high social standing . = = Life = = = = = Ancestry = = = Born near Mobile , then a part of French Louisiana , on May 31 , 1760 , Simon Favre was the son of Jean Claude Favre ( 1721 \u2013 1782 ) and Marguerite Wiltz ( 1740 \u2013 1805 ) . His grandfather , Jean Baptiste Favre , came from Royan , France , and by tradition was a cabin boy when Pierre D 'Iberville placed him on shore near Biloxi to make contact with the natives . His father was a government interpreter who was commissioned to explain the terms of the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) to the natives upon the conclusion of the French and Indian War . Favre 's mother was the daughter of a Swiss soldier . = = = Early life = = = Learning from his father , Favre became fluent in the languages of French , English , Spanish , and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw . The lands along the Gulf coast were held by the British for nearly two decades following the 1763 Treaty of Paris , but their ability to maintain control diminished during that time . On September 3 , 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles . Favre 's father had just died the year before this treaty , and Simon Favre followed his father 's career , also inheriting his father 's plantation on the Pearl River , though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother . Favre spent his early adult years among the natives along the Tombigbee River , being initially employed by the French as an interpreter of the Choctaw language , but soon coming into the employ of the British and later the Spanish . Favre also understood the Chickasaw language , but at one point his translation was challenged by James Colbert ( grandfather of Holmes Colbert ) , who had married into the Chickasaw tribe , and was asked by the tribe to replace Favre as interpreter . Favre was said to be a confidante and personal friend of the celebrated Choctaw Indian chief Pushmataha . Genealogist Heitzmann relates that at one point Favre acted as the interpreter between Pushmataha and the military commanders Andrew Jackson and General Thomas Hinds . In 1792 Juan De la Villebeuvre , who worked among the Indians on behalf of the Spanish government , was named a special commissioner to the Choctaws and Chickasaws . Favre 's reputation as a competent and valuable interpreter grew quickly , and in an undated letter to Governor Francisco Carondelet , De la Villebeuvre wrote , \" ... I am going to reside with Favre , who is employed by the king [ of Spain ] and who will serve me as interpreter . He is the best one of the province , with a great influence over the minds of the Indians , and he knows how to lead them firmly whenever necessary . \" Favre built a house for De la Villebeuvre about 12 miles from the village of the Choctaw chief Franchimastabee with whom Favre had become friendly . Favre was present at Fort Nogales , located in Choctaw territory near the mouth of the Yazoo River , when the Treaty of Nogales was signed on October 28 , 1793 . The treaty was between Spain ( and signed by the king ) and the Alibamon , Cherokee , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek and Tallapoosa nations . Representing the Choctaws were chiefs Franchimastabee and Pushmataha , while Favre signed as a witness . In January 1794 Favre wrote a letter to Don Manuel Lanzos , Spanish commander at Natchez , warning of a great rumor among the Choctaws that the Americans were coming to destroy them . The Choctaws were in difficult straits at the time , from both the consumption of alcohol and from a corn crop failure brought on by an earlier drought . They were stealing horses from other tribes as well as from the Europeans , and Favre himself had three horses stolen while staying near the Tombigbee . De la Villebeuvre felt that these actions were being instigated by the Americans , and Favre was sent to the Choctaw villages to assess the feelings of the natives . Following the Treaty of Boukfouka on May 10 , 1793 , the Spaniards built a fort on the location where the French had earlier built Fort Tombecbe , and named it Confederacion in honor of the alliance between the Spanish and Indians . In the late 1700s Favre was living near Fort Confederation , but sometime after 1797 moved to St. Stephens . He moved into a house across the road from Augustin Rochon , his future father-in-law . After spending time there and at various other locations along the Tombigbee , Favre returned to Mobile before 1800 where he occupied a house on Loyal Street . While there , he associated with other interpreters including J. B. Roussere and Simon Andry . Favre also maintained very close ties with New Orleans , and he called himself of that city in the 1800 baptismal record for his son Simon . = = = Pearl River = = = After having seven children with two other women , Favre was legally married in Mobile in 1801 to Celeste Rochon . Sometime between 1804 and 1806 , following the birth of two children in Mobile , he moved with his new family to one of his plantations on the Pearl River , near what became Pearlington , Mississippi . This was shortly following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 , when the Americans were showing a great interest in West Florida , still governed by Spain . Favre then became an important interpreter in the service of the Americans , as well as continuing to work for the Spanish who were eventually compelled to give up control of their Florida lands . While Favre 's importance had initially sprung from his influence with the native tribes , particularly the Choctaws , as the power of these people declined he became much more important as an intermediary during the turbulent times of transition from Spanish to American rule in West Florida . During this period early in the 19th century , the Spanish authorities were losing their hold on West Florida for a variety of reasons . One such reason was piracy , while another was American encroachment following the Louisiana Purchase . Many Americans felt that West Florida should have been included in the purchase . One means used by Spain to attempt to hold on to this region was to commission several important settlers to work for their government . In this regard , Favre was assigned to confirm land deeds that the Spanish were doling out at an accelerated rate , to attempt to stem the tide of American encroachment . Favre also provided intelligence and military maps to the Spanish concerning the activities of not only the Americans , who were applying pressure from outside the jurisdiction , but also rebels along the Pearl River and nearby coast . The rebels , led by Reuben Kemper and his brothers , were causing difficulties from within , and had been attempting to pull West Florida from Spanish control for several years . Under the Spanish , Favre became known as the commander of the District of Bay St. Louis . Many of the land titles that were awarded by Favre were later reviewed by the United States government and appear in the collection of American state papers . With Americans in control of New Orleans , mail from Fort Stoddard , near Mobile , had to pass through Spanish territory to get there . In 1808 the United States Postmaster wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury that Favre , who was still a Spanish subject , served as an agent for the post office , forwarding the mail passing through Spanish lands . Though West Florida was not officially ceded to the United States until 1819 under the provisions of the Adams-Onis Treaty , in November 1810 Spanish governor Folach , demanding secrecy , essentially delivered both East and West Florida to the United States in trust . This was done in hopes that the \" robberies and depredations \" upon the citizens would cease , and under the realization that the transfer was inevitable . Soon thereafter American officials began managing the Florida lands , setting up administrative regions within them , and the western part of West Florida ( the part in present-day Louisiana ) was absorbed into the United States under the proclamation of President James Madison . When Louisiana became a state in 1812 , the remainder of West Florida ( the panhandles of Mississippi and Alabama ) was absorbed by the United States . The western part of this newly annexed Mobile District was organized into Hancock and Harrison Counties ( soon a part of the Mississippi Territory ) , and in 1813 American federal troops were stationed there to formalize the transition . = = = Late career and death = = = Just as his father had made the transition from French to British rule , Favre likewise had little difficulty changing his allegiance from the Spanish to the Americans , and he continued to hold a prominent position in the region . In January 1811 Favre was chosen by the Orleans territorial governor William C. C. Claiborne as a magistrate of the \" Parish of Biloxi \" which was within the territory . When Claiborne became the Louisiana governor following statehood in 1812 , he commissioned Favre as a justice of the peace , and clearly admired him , calling him in a letter an educated and very agreeable man who would make an energetic officer . At the outset of the War of 1812 , the Americans were interested in assessing the alignment of the native tribes in regards to their loyalty to Britain . In August 1812 Claiborne sent Favre to present a talk to the native tribes of West Florida . Favre 's carefully crafted words , presented under Claiborne 's name , provide an example of the diplomatic skill with which Favre was able to address the language and culture of the Muskogean tribes . While the goal of Favre and the governor was to keep the Choctaws and other tribes out of the \" white man 's war \" , ultimately the Creeks aligned themselves with the British , and the Americans requested assistance from the Choctaws . In a letter to Secretary of War John Armstrong , Claiborne recommended that \" Colonel Simon Favre \" become a United States agent for the Choctaws . Favre held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Hancock County militia , and early in the War of 1812 he was able to negotiate with the Choctaws to provide assistance against Britain 's Creek allies . Favre died in the summer of 1813 , and though he was living along the Pearl River , court testimony by Peter Moran in 1845 stated that he died in Mobile , and had not been there long before his death . A letter by Mississippi governor David Holmes , dated August 1 , 1813 , mentions the \" absence of Colonel Favre at Mobile \" and \" his subsequent death \" . Favre 's daughter Mary stated that he died on July 21 , but an obituary that appeared in a New Orleans newspaper on July 20 gives his death date as July 3 . Several years after his death , in 1817 or 1818 , his widow married Isaac Graves , with whom she had one additional child , and they lived in Pearlington , Mississippi . Graves had been the operator of Favre 's schooner , Pearl , and had very little estate , but following his marriage to Favre 's widow , he utilized Favre 's estate as his own , much to the disadvantage of Favre 's heirs . = = Favre 's \" wives \" = = While a young man , conducting his business among the Choctaws , Favre consummated a relationship with a native woman named Pistikiokonay , who may have been a daughter of the Choctaw Chief Pushmataha , since there was a documented relationship between Favre and this chief . Over a period of about 15 years Favre sired at least six chldren with this woman , the first of whom was born in about 1784 . Shortly before 1800 he then had a relationship with a woman whose first name has been given as Rebecca or Rosella , and whose last name has been written as Austin or Ostein , with other spelling variations . In 1800 he had an illegitimate son born of this union , and this son , Simon , Jr . , was later named prominently in his will . In 1801 a number of slave exchanges took place between Favre and Austin , as he prepared to marry another woman . On March 25 , 1801 he was legally married to Celeste Rochon , a daughter of Augustine Rochon and Luisa Fievre of Mobile , with whom he had six more children . = = Land holdings and slaves = = In 1806 Favre began cultivation of land on the Pearl River in what became Hancock County , Mississippi . Favre 's land holdings were extensive , and his will mentions eight different plantations totalling over 5000 acres in area . He also acquired 57 slaves shortly before his death , as they were not mentioned in his will , but later became prominently mentioned during the settlement of his estate . The October 1814 inventory of his personal property includes a list of the 57 slaves , giving the name , age , and value of each . The oldest was 80 and valued at $ 5.00 , while the most valuable was a 30-year-old \" cow hunter \" valued at $ 900 . Collectively , the slaves were valued at just under $ 15,000 . The inventory also mentioned 6200 arpents ( 5247 acres ) of land valued at $ 2410 , a schooner named Pearl , and 450 head of cattle . One of Favre 's properties on the Pearl River was originally settled by his father in 1767 , and was inherited by Favre upon his father 's death in 1782 . This plantation later became known as the town of Napoleon , and Favre kept a store there that later became a part of the community 's church . In 1961 all the residents of the town were moved when the property was declared within the buffer zone of the John C. Stennis Space Center . Another one of his Pearl River properties became the town of Pearlington , Mississippi , where many of his children , including those of his Choctaw mistress , lived . Though Favre lived in Hancock County in West Florida , and died in Mobile , Mississippi Territory , documents concerning his estate were also filed in New Orleans , Louisiana , probably by his Hancock County attorney , Rutillius Pray of Pearlington . By 1826 the estate had been partially settled , and during the October court term Pray submitted a final settlement showing total sales from the estate of just under $ 27,000 ( including nearly $ 22,000 for slaves ) , while total debts amounted to nearly $ 33,000 . However , taking into account unsold assets , the estate appears to have been solvent . = = Family = = Favre 's earliest known children were with his Choctaw mistress named Pistikiokonay . This woman lived in what later became Lauderdale County , Mississippi , though most of her children moved to Hancock County where Favre had two large plantations along the Pearl River . Favre had six known or suspected children with her , the earliest born about 1784 , and the last possibly born about 1805 , though without birth records there is uncertainty among most of the birth years . The oldest child was likely Alexis ( male ) , born about 1784 ( based on a deposition he made in 1844 , calling himself aged 60 ) ; he married a Choctaw named Cuna and had several children . A second child , Katherine , died after 1830 without issue . Louis , possibly the third child , had a wife named \" Milisew \" and four children ; he died between 1830 and 1835 . Charles , born about 1798 ( deposed in 1856 that he was 58 years old ) , married Carmelite LaFontaine , had several children , and died by 1868 . Mary , born about 1800 ( aged 70 in the 1870 census ) , never married , but was highly respected in the family and became the administratrix of her father 's estate . Favre 's youngest child with his Choctaw mistress appears to be Jean Baptiste , usually just called Baptiste , who was born about 1805 ( aged about 40 in 1845 ) , married a woman named Toshowahoke , and had two children . In 1800 Favre had an illegitimate son with Rebecca Austin ( also called Rosella Ostein ) , a native of Tombigbee in the District of Mobile . The child , named Simon , was born February 5 , 1800 . Favre left a bequest to the child in 1812 so that he could \" be taught to read and write and to learn a trade or profession . \" Favre had six children with his legal wife , Celeste Rochon , the oldest of whom was Jean ( John ) , born August 2 , 1802 , died January 7 , 1888 , and married Dianna Edwards . Augustine ( Gus ) was born July 17 , 1804 and had two wives , Eleanor and Mary Jane , whose maiden names are uncertain . The third child of this marriage , Onezan ( Nezan ) , was born December 23 , 1806 , died May 10 , 1875 , and married Mary Moody . Next was Louisa Eucharist , born May 15 , 1809 , who married first James Conerly , and then John L. Armstrong . The fifth child was Marguerite , born January 17 , 1812 , died February 6 , 1908 , and married James Murphy . The last child of this marriage was Carlota , who was confirmed in New Orleans in February 1813 , and thus does not appear in her father 's 1812 will . She is not mentioned as an heir of Simon , so may have died young . Probably the best known of Favre 's descendants is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre , who descends from Simon 's Choctaw mistress , through their son Louis .",

The Mahamuni Buddha image ( literal meaning : The Great Sage ) is deified in this temple , and originally came from Arakan . It is highly venerated in Burma and central to many people 's lives , as it is seen as an expression of representing the Buddha 's life . Ancient tradition refers to only five likenesses of the Buddha , made during his lifetime ; two were in India , two in paradise , and the fifth is the Mahamuni Buddha image in Myanmar . According to the legend , the Buddha visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC . King Sanda Thuriya requested that an image was cast of him . After casting the Great Image , the Buddha breathed upon it , and thereafter the image became the exact likeness of the Mahamuni . = = History = = = = = Origins = = = According to legend , the Gautama Buddha visited Dhanyawadi , the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a Proselytization mission to spread Buddhism . During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time , a devout Buddhist , the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town . The King of Arakan , along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala ( with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting ) , and an entourage of ministers , generals and officials , paid homage to the Buddha . They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi ( Sravasti ) , the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship . For this purpose , the Buddha then sat under a Bodhi tree for a week of meditation . During this time Sakka ( in P\u0101li , the ruler of the Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba Heaven in Buddhist cosmology , supported by his assistant Vissakamma , moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people . It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma ( or Vishvakarman ) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days . After looking at his own lifelike image , believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness , Buddha was pleased and \" imbued the image with his spiritual essence \" , or \" enlivened and consecrated \" the image , naming it \" Candasara \" . He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative . Historian Juliane Schober has very succinctly explained this legend and the cult worship that has evolved around the \" living \" double image of Mahamuni Buddha : The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha ... The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously : they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology , and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma . Theravada politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha 's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image . The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains . Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle relates to the nine phenomena that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed . These nine phenomena were : holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels ; the water from the tank that was used for washing the Buddha 's head would retain its quality throughout the year ; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings ; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers ; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees ; the leaves of trees would tilt in the direction of the Buddha image ; birds would not fly over the temple ; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple . Another legend narrated is linked to the six Khmer bronze statues ( three lions \u2013 with heads substituted later in Burmese style , a three-headed elephant known as Airavata , and two warriors in the form of Shiva ) , which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard . These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia . Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases . = = = Image history = = = In the ancient history of Arakan , King Anawratha of Pagan ( r . 1044 \u2013 1077 ) attempted to move the image to Pagan , without success . In 1784 , the Burmese under the military leadership of Crown Prince Thado Minsaw of Konbaung dynasty conquered the Kingdom of Mrauk U. The religious relics of the kingdom , including the Mahamuni Buddha image , were confiscated and installed in the Mahamuni temple or Pagoda at Amarapura , on the outskirts of the old capital of Mandalay . As the Mahamuni image was too large to transport as a whole , it was cut into sections and later reassembled and housed in the new temple . Mandalay became the capital under King Mindon ( r . 1853 \u2013 1878 ) . It was also the capital under his son Thibaw ( r . 1878 \u2013 1885 ) of the Konbaung Dynasty ( 1752 \u2013 1885 ) . When the British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to prevent the French from dominating it , monarchic rule ended . However , veneration of the Mahamuni image has continued , and is visited and idolised by many pilgrims , mainly Rakhine , Mon and Burmans peoples . Several old bronze statues that line the courtyard of the temple have a long history as war loot . They were originally Khmer statues , found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia , and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese . In 1564 , the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago ( Pegu ) . In 1599 , King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally , Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785 . According to local belief , many more of these statues were brought from Arakan . However , King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace . Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung brought from Siam , only six remain today , and are displayed in the temple complex . They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities . = = = Damage = = = The Mahamnuni image and its precincts suffered damage from fires in 1879 and 1884 . In the fire that broke out during the reign of King Thibaw , the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple , devotional halls , causeways and others were burnt down , although the Great Image itself was saved . Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the image . In 1887 , Minister Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung took charge of the site and in1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya . In 1996 , the military rulers in Burma undertook renovation work on the Mahamuni Pagoda . During this period , the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the belly of the Great Image . It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image . It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night , resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter . Whilst the meeting was in progress , attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl . A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all . It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired . However , the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all . = = Architecture = = = = = Main Temple \/ Pagoda = = = The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is a complex of structures located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest . It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King Bodawpaya to the eastern gate of the temple , although only remnants of this road can still be seen . A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the Thudhamma Nikaya ( order ) , is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda . The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn . The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks , selling religious paraphernalia such as incense , candles , rosaries , flowers , robes , sandals etc . , and various restaurants and tea shops . The sanctum sanctorum , where the large Mahamuni image is deified , is a small chamber and has a roof covering made up of seven pyatthat meaning tiered roofs ( derivative of the Sanskrit word prasada ) . The ceiling has an ornate mosaic covering . The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes . = = = Mahamuni image = = = The Mahamuni Buddha image is housed in a small chamber , seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the Bhumisparsa Mudra . This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha 's vanquishing of Mara ) . The legs are crossed with feet turned inwards , and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically , as a witness of his past deeds . The image is cast in bronze and weighs 6.5 tonnes and is erected on a 1.84 metres ( 6.0 ft ) high pedestal and reaches a height of 3.82 metres ( 12.5 ft ) . Its shoulders measure 1.84 metres ( 6.0 ft ) and its waist measures 2.9 metres ( 9.5 ft ) . It is draped in royal costumes with \" Brahmanic cords ( salwe ) and regalia crossing his chest \" . The image is crowned , bejewelled with diamonds , rubies and sapphires . The left hand appears imprecise , unusually large , and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm . Gold leaves are regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha by male devotees . Consequent to the frequent application of gold leaves , the coating of gold ( thickness 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) ) has given a shapeless contour to the Mahamuni image . However , it is also noted that the right hand , crown and other iconographic characteristics of royalty are free of gold leaf covering , which gives an impression that these were later additions to the original image of the Mahamuni . In 1884 , when the pagoda was burnt down , 91 kilograms ( 201 lb ) of gold was recovered from the site , which represents the continued historical veneration and perpetuation of the cult of Mahamuni . = = = Other features = = = A large number of ' inscription stones ' collected by King Bodawpaya are seen in a long gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard . These inscriptions , some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone , have been collected from many regions of the country . There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with rice cakes by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temple every day . Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum , which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia . = = Daily rituals = = On February 17 , 1988 , the present Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung initiated the ritual of daily face washing of the deity at dawn . This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4 : 30 am when monks wash the face and brush the teeth of the Buddha image . It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire , assisted by several lay helpers , dressed in white and wearing formal headdress . As soon as the drums are struck , the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels , offered by devotees . He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni 's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels . After this , sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water . After the ceremony is completed , the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines . On special occasions , such as Uposatha day , an orange stoll is placed around its shoulders by the presiding monk and is fanned . A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals ; some men sit in the front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer . Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed . During the winter season , the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order . During the reign of Burmese monarchs , offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way . Food and other offerings , sheltered by a Royal white umbrella , were taken in a procession from the palace , escorted by a Minister , as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state . = = Festival = = A major annual pagoda festival known as the ' Mahamuni Paya Pwe ' ( ' pwe ' meaning \" festival \" ) is held in early February , at the end of the Buddhist Lent to celebrate the history of the pagoda . During this festival , aside from the daily rituals , the Patthana from a \" Book of Conditional Relations \" is recited . This book is a philosophical text which Buddha recounted to his mother in a sermon in Tavatimsa heaven and is a sacred scripture in the Pali language . The Pattana recitation is a special feature , which continues for several days . Monks recite from the scriptures , in groups of two or three . The festivities also include various forms of entertainment programmes such as dance , music , theatre etc . , and there is also a social event , allowing families and friends gather to greet each other . Given that large crowds of pilgrims are attracted during the festive season , guards are posted near the Great Image and video cameras are placed in many parts of the temple precincts to protect it . = = Gallery = =",

The party sought to promote multiculturalism , advocate for rights of ethnic minorities and recent immigrants focusing on employment access , security , health care , education and overall rights and status . It was an advocacy party that sought to politically empower and enable those who do not speak English as a first language to participate in politics . Led by Wei Ping Chen , the party was founded in June 2007 . Chen stood for election in Richmond in the October 2008 federal election , and for mayor of Richmond , British Columbia in the November 2008 municipal election , losing both times . In the May 2009 provincial election the party nominated two candidates , one in Richmond Centre and the other in Richmond East , neither of whom were elected but combined for 818 total votes . = = Background = = The Nation Alliance Party was founded in June 2007 by four people : realtor Wei Ping Chen of Delta , renovator Steven Lian from Surrey , tourism guide Randy Liu from Burnaby , and Simon Fraser University student Locan Wang . Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing , via Australia . He witnessed the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country , and how uninvolved they were in politics . Contrasted to his experience in China , Wei Ping Chen was impressed with the political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party . He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English , would empower those communities to become more politically active . Wei Ping Chen was a candidate in the October 2008 federal election in the Richmond electoral district . However , because the party was not registered with Elections Canada , he ran as an independent . He came in fifth place , with 397 votes ( 0.93 % ) , losing to the Conservative Party 's Alice Wong . In November 2008 , Nation Alliance Party members nominated candidates for the municipal election in Richmond . Wei Ping Chen challenged incumbent Malcolm Brodie for the mayoral position and Kang Chen , Yang Dai , Jiajian Cheung , Jian Liu , and Bai Chen were nominated for councillor positions . Like the federal campaign , they were classified as independents . The latest census at the time reported that 50 % of Richmond 's population was of Chinese descent and their campaign highlighted the language barrier faced by those who did not speak English , for example tax notices were only available in English .

While the party did not maintain a full slate of policy positions , its candidates advocated for increasing the number of police in Richmond , especially along the SkyTrain route , protection of green spaces , support for affordable housing , and trade missions with China . They were generally in favour of lower taxes but with more spending on senior services and education .

        "doc": "Irfan Pathan = Irfan Khan Pathan ( pronunciation ; born 27 October 1984 ) is an Indian cricketer who made his debut for India in the 2003 \/ 04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy , and was a core member of the national team until a decline in form set in during 2006 , forcing him out of the team . Since then , he has been in and out of the limited-overs teams ( ODIs and T20Is ) , and has only sporadic appearances in Test cricket . Pathan played his last Test in April , 2008 at the age of 24 . Beginning his career as a fast-medium swing and seam bowler , Pathan broke into the national team soon after turning 19 , and evoked comparisons with Pakistan 's Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious swing . He cemented his position in the team and was named by the International Cricket Council as the 2004 Emerging Player of the Year . Pathan was instrumental in India 's One-day international and Test series wins in Pakistan in 2004 . He was described by the media as the \" blue-eyed boy \" of the Indian cricket . In late-2004 he took 18 wickets in two Tests against Bangladesh , but the start of 2005 he performed poorly and conceded runs at a high rate , leading to a brief exile from the one-day international ( ODI ) team . Immediately thereafter , Australian Greg Chappell , one of the leading batsmen of his time , became India 's coach ( 2005 ) and identified Pathan 's batting potential . Pathan improved his batting skills and tried to become a complete bowling all-rounder , and he opened the batting on occasions in ODIs and scored 93 in a Test match ( 10 Dec 2005 , versus Sri Lanka in Delhi ) in the role after an illness to Virender Sehwag . He made three scores beyond 80 in the space of four Test innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan . For the first nine months of Chappell 's stint at the helm , Pathan performed strongly with both bat and ball , scoring runs regularly and frequently taking top-order wickets . He rose to No. 2 in the ICC 's ODI rankings for all-rounders and was also in the top five in the Test rankings . This led critics to compare him to former Indian pace bowling allrounder Kapil Dev . In early 2006 , Pathan became the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick in the first over of the match ( vs Pakistan at Karachi ) . However , the productive run did not last and after the start of 2006 , Pathan began to steadily lose pace and swing , and his wicket-taking dwindled . Although Pathan 's batting continued to be productive , he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006 , and by 2007 was no longer in the squad . He returned to international cricket in September 2007 for the inaugural World Twenty20 , where he took three wickets and was man of the match as India beat Pakistan in the final . This earned him a recall into the ODI team , where he was a regular for most of the next 12 months before being dropped as his economy rate continued to trend upwards and subsequently struggled with a loss of form and injuries . In late-2007 Pathan was also recalled into the Test team after 19 months and hit his maiden Test century , but could not maintain his place in the team as his bowling was not effective enough with only two pacemen needed . Pathan played his last Test for India in April 2008 against South Africa . He continued to perform with both bat and ball at the domestic level , although his sedate pace is frequently criticized as being irrelevant at the international level . However , he impressed during the 2011 \u2013 12 Ranji Trophy , where he was the leading wicket-taker , and his performances earned him a recall to the national side again . Irfan Pathan , along with players such as Vinod Kambli and Laxman Sivaramakrishnan , was included in the list of \" India 's lost boys \" by Shashi Tharoor . = = Early years = = Pathan was born 27 October 1984 in Baroda , Gujarat , India and is of Pashtun ( Pathan ) ancestry , belonging to the Pathan community in Gujarat . He grew up with his elder brother Yusuf in a mosque in Vadodara , in an impoverished family . His father served as the muezzin . Although their parents wished them to become Islamic scholars , Pathan and his brother took an interest in cricket . Their games on the grounds off and inside the mosque often necessitated apologies from their father to Muslim worshippers who visited it . In the beginning his deliveries did not reach the other end of the cricket pitch , but rigorous six-hour training sessions in blazing heat and his family 's sense of discipline saw him progress steadily . Under the guidance of former Indian captain Datta Gaekwad , Pathan rose to get selected in the Under-14 Baroda cricket team , and when he was selected at Under-15 level to represent Baroda in a national tournament , he was finally presented with a full set of cricket equipment , having before been restricted to second-hand gear due to his family 's limited economic means . In December 1997 , Pathan broke into the Baroda Under-16 team , less than two months after turning 13 . He took a total of 1 \/ 35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped immediately afterwards . He did not play again for the Under-16s for two years , and in November 1999 , less than a month after turning 15 , he made his next appearance , this time for Baroda Under-19s against Maharashtra . He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3 \/ 41 in a victory , but was immediately dropped back to the Under-16s for the next match , and spent the rest of the 1999 \u2013 2000 season there . He bowled short spells in the younger division , taking four wickets at 38.00 in six matches , averaging less than seven overs an innings . He had more success with the bat , scoring 253 runs at 31.62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai . Pathan was then selected for the India Under-15 team in mid-2000 to play a series of matches against their colleagues from other countries . He took 15 wickets at 12.66 in ten matches , including a best of 3 \/ 2 against Thailand , and scored 15 runs at 7.50 . India won all but one of the matches , most by enormous margins . At the start of the 2000 \u2013 01 season , Pathan was immediately back in the Under-19s , this time bowling more , often delivering more than 20 overs per innings . In four matches , he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not out , and took 10 wickets at 32.50 . He was then promoted to the Under-22s , where he scored 44 and took 4 \/ 71 in his first match against Saurashtra , prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team . = = Senior beginnings = = He started against Bengal in March 2001 , after fellow left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan was selected for the national team . He scored 13 not out and 2 , and took 3 \/ 40 and 2 \/ 68 in a 222-run win . However , he was unable to repeat this form in the three remaining matches , taking only two more wickets in total , but Baroda nevertheless managed to win the Ranji Trophy . He ended his maiden season with seven wickets at 43.28 and 75 runs at 12.50 with a best score of 40 not out against Orissa . The Ranji win saw Baroda qualify for the following season 's Irani Trophy where they took on the Rest of India . Pathan scored 32 in the second innings and took 3 \/ 95 and 1 \/ 34 in a defeat , but his performance reminded Test batsman V. V. S. Laxman of Zaheer . However , he was omitted from the senior team and sent back to the Under-19s the next week and stayed there for the next two months , playing eight double-innings matches for Baroda . He took 20 wickets at 20.40 , including a best of 6 \/ 41 against Gujarat , and scoring 190 runs at 31.66 with a best of 63 not out . Pathan was then recalled to the senior team and made his List A debut against Mumbai , taking 1 \/ 69 from nine overs . Pathan further honed his bowling at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai , after being referred by Indian selector Kiran More . In early-2002 , he was selected for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand , where he took six wickets at 27.50 and scored 30 runs at 15.00 , taking 2 \/ 18 in a win over South Africa . Upon returning to India , Pathan was selected in a senior zonal team for the first time . He was selected for West Zone for the Duleep Trophy , even though he had not played a single match for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy season . He immediately repaid the selectors ' faith by taking 4 \/ 74 and 6 \/ 72 , his first ten-wicket match haul , in the first fixture against Central Zone , setting up a 161-run win . In the next match , he took 4 \/ 72 and 3 \/ 85 as West defeated North by 178 runs . He only took 1 \/ 55 in the next match against South but West were through to the final , where he took 4 \/ 43 to help cut down East Zone for 162 in the first innings , sealing the title . In all Pathan , had taken 22 wickets at 18.22 for the tournament , and scored 46 runs at 11.50 . These performances propelled Pathan into the India A team at the age of 17 and a half , for a tour of Sri Lanka , where he took six wickets at 35.00 in three first-class matches . Pathan then went on an India Under-19 tour of England in mid-2002 . He took 15 wickets at 25.93 in the three youth Tests , which India lost 1 \u2013 0 , with a best of 4 \/ 83 in the Second Test . He then took four wickets at 42.00 , conceding more than six runs an over , and scored 66 runs at 33.00 in the three youth ODIs , which India won 2 \u2013 1 . Pathan was rewarded with selection in the Rest of India team that played against Railways in the Irani Trophy at the start of the 2002 \u2013 03 season . He took a total of 2 \/ 84 and scored 29 as the Ranji champions prevailed . He struggled in the Ranji Trophy , taking 18 wickets at 39.33 in seven matches . Half of his wickets came in one match against Orissa in which he claimed 6 \/ 31 and 3 \/ 46 in an innings victory . He scored 161 runs at 23.00 , with a 54 against Tamil Nadu being his maiden first-class fifty , as well as two other forties . Despite a lack of wickets for Baroda , Pathan was selected for the Duleep Trophy , playing for Elite Group A. He took 5 \/ 88 and 4 \/ 106 against Plate Group A and 4 \/ 101 against Elite Group C , before taking 3 \/ 53 and 2 \/ 42 as Elite Group A defeated Elite Group B in the final by seven wickets . Pathan ended the tournament with 19 wickets at 27.00 and scored 72 runs at 24.00 . In the one-dayers , Pathan also struggled for Baroda , taking three wickets at 64.66 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.85 , but he was nevertheless selected for the zonal team , where he took four wickets at 34.25 in four matches at an economy rate of 3.91 . In 2003 he was selected for the India A team which travelled to England . Playing in five first-class matches , Pathan took nine wickets at 43.77 , including 4 \/ 60 against Yorkshire and 3 \/ 83 against South Africa . He managed only 8 runs at 4.00 with the bat . He had more success in the limited-overs matches , taking eight wickets at 11.12 in three matches , including a 4 \/ 19 against Lancashire , and scoring 27 runs at 27.00 . At the start of the 2003 \u2013 04 season , Pathan played in the domestic Challenger Trophy for the first time . Representing India A , he had little success , taking two wickets at 79.00 at an economy rate of 5.85 , and he did not force his way into India 's limited-overs team . He was then selected for India Emerging Players for a series of limited-overs matches against counterparts from Pakistan and Sri Lanka . Pathan took seven wickets at 11.00 in three matches , including 4 \/ 22 and 3 \/ 35 in two matches against Pakistan . In late 2003 , he was selected for the India Under-19 team to compete in an Asian youth ODI competition in Pakistan , where he was the leading bowler with 18 wickets at 7.38 , with an economy rate of 3.54 . This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket-taker . He was named as the player of the tournament , which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final . Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9 \/ 16 against Bangladesh , helping to bowl them out for 34 , and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final , taking 3 \/ 33 . Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat , compiling scores of 32 , 28 and 34 . Pathan returned to India and took 3 \/ 51 and 1 \/ 33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season , against Andhra Pradesh . This resulted in him being selected for the Indian national squad for the 2003 \u2013 04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia . = = Early international career ( 2003 \u2013 2005 ) = = Pathan made his Test debut in the Second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 2003 . At the age of 19 , he opened the bowling following an injury to the Baroda left-armer Zaheer Khan in the First Test . In a high scoring match , he took the wicket of Matthew Hayden while giving away 160 runs at almost five runs an over . He scored one in his only innings as India took a four-wicket victory . He was dropped for the following Test upon the return of Zaheer , but was recalled for the Fourth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Zaheer broke down in his only spell in the Third Test . On another flat pitch , Pathan took the wickets of Steve Waugh , Adam Gilchrist in the first innings in a spell of reverse swing bowling . He had Waugh caught behind from an outswinger and then bowled Gilchrist with an inswinging yorker . He ended with 2 \/ 80 in the first innings and dismissed Ricky Ponting in the second innings to end with match figures of 3 \/ 106 . In the ODI tri-nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed , Pathan was the leading wicket-taker with 16 wickets at an average of 31 in his maiden ODI series . After ending with 0 \/ 61 from ten overs on debut against Australia , he bounced back to take 3 \/ 64 and 3 \/ 51 in the next two matches against the World Cup holders . He earned his first international man of the match award in the tournament , after taking 4 \/ 24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI . However , his tour ended on a bad note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final . In that match , he took 2 \/ 75 as Australia amassed 5 \/ 359 and crushed India by 208 runs . Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151 . His batting improved towards the end of the tour with three scores of at least 19 in his last four innings , and he ended with 86 runs at 17.20 for the tournament . Pathan subsequently led the pace attack again on the 2004 Test tour to Pakistan , taking 12 wickets and bowling a higher proportion of maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India 's first series victory over Pakistan in two decades . In the first innings , he bowled 28 overs and took 4 \/ 100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead . After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on , Pathan tied the Pakistanis down , bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2 \/ 26 as India secured an innings win . Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order , helping India to recover to 287 . However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite Pathan bowling 44 overs to take 3 \/ 107 , and the hosts went on to complete a nine-wicket win . In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi , Pathan took 2 \/ 49 and 1 \/ 35 in an innings win . He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28.50 and 64 runs at 21.33 . He also continued his prolific wicket-taking in the ODIs , taking eight wickets at 17.87 at an economy rate of 4.76 in three matches , including three top-order wickets in the deciding fifth ODI in Lahore . He also scored 36 runs at 36.00 in the ODIs . His ability to swing the ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation that he could become an all rounder . In recognition of his performances at the start of his international career , Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004 . Pathan continued his productive form in ODIs at the 2004 Asian Cup in Sri Lanka , where he was the leading wicket-taker with 14 wickets at 16.28 at an economy rate of 4.37 in six matches , with three three-wicket hauls against the United Arab Emirates , Bangladesh and Pakistan respectively . He also scored 64 runs at 32.00 including a 38 in a defeat against Pakistan . He then struggled during an ODI tour in Europe , taking three wickets at 78.00 at an economy rate of 5.48 from five matches . India won only one of these games and lost four . Pathan returned to form during India 's brief campaign at the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England , where he claimed 5 wickets at an average of 9.00 and economy rate of 3.00 . He took 2 \/ 11 against Kenya and 3 \/ 34 against Pakistan , but defeat at the hands of the latter ended India 's campaign . Returning to India , Pathan then represented his country at the highest level for the first time on home soil . Pathan continued to improve his batting with a defiant 31 and 55 against Australia in October 2004 in the First Test in Bangalore . This was his first half-century in Tests , and was scored after the specialist batsmen had failed . Nevertheless , he managed a total of only 2 \/ 100 and India fell to a 217-run loss . Pathan 's career was put on hold after he suffered a side strain in the following Test in Chennai , in which he totalled 0 \/ 68 , causing him to miss the Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai . Australia went on to take the series 2 \u2013 1 and Pathan ended with two wickets at 84.00 and 100 runs at 33.33 . After being overlooked for the First Test with selectors opting for three spinners , he returned in the Second Test against South Africa in Kolkata , aggregating 3 \/ 89 and scoring 24 in an eight-wicket win that sealed a 1 \u2013 0 series win . Pathan made his name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh . Swinging the ball both ways , Pathan took 5 \/ 45 and 6 \/ 51 including several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory . He followed this with a match haul of 7 \/ 118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series . India swept the series , winning both matches by an innings . Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily , Pathan managed only five and four . He played in only one of the three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players , taking 1 \/ 45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win . In late 2004 , the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced central contracts for international players for the first time , and Pathan was given a B-grade contract . 2005 began rather poorly for Pathan . He took only six wickets at 68.33 in the home Test series against Pakistan after losing pace and accuracy . In the last two matches , he managed totals of 2 \/ 122 and 1 \/ 160 , conceding more than four runs an over as the Pakistani batsmen scored heavily . He scored 64 runs at 16.00 and made a duck in the second innings of the Third Test as the hosts collapsed on the last day to squander the series 1 \u2013 1 . He was subsequently dropped for the ODI series , playing in only one match in which he conceded 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs . However , he did manage to post his first ODI half-century , scoring 64 , defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213 , sealing a 106-run loss . Greg Chappell became the coach of the Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder . He started to hone Pathan 's batting skills , which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64 . Pathan was subsequently signed by Middlesex County Cricket Club for the English country season , where he attempted to regain his form after his bad start to the year . Pathan arrived in late-May and stayed for six weeks . He achieved better results than in the Pakistan series , taking six wickets at 24.66 and an economy rate of 5.41 in four one-dayers , including 3 \/ 42 against Essex . In the new Twenty20 format , Pathan took 12 wickets at 12.75 and an economy rate of 6.37 in seven matches , including a best of 4 \/ 27 against Essex . He scored 21 not out in the same match to help seal a 31-run win . However , his difficulties in first-class matches continued . He took 4 \/ 81 and 1 \/ 68 , and scored 41 and 13 not out in a productive debut against Sussex , and Middlesex were only one wicket away from victory when time ran out . However , he failed to take another wicket and ended with five wickets at 64.80 and 126 runs at 63.00 , scoring 68 against Surrey . = = Chappell era ( 2005 \u2013 2007 ) = = Pathan was recalled to the ODI team for the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August . This was Chappell 's first series as a coach , in which Pathan played in all five matches and took 6 wickets at 33.83 at an economy rate of 4.41 , but conceded 0 \/ 59 from nine overs as the hosts won the final . He scored 58 runs at 29.00 including an unbeaten 36 after India 's batting collapsed in a loss to the hosts in a preliminary match . He showed further signs of returning to peak form in the Videocon Triangular Series in Zimbabwe , taking 10 wickets at 16.10 at an economy rate of 5.03 and scored 60 runs at 30.00 in four matches . This included a haul of 3 \/ 34 and then a score of 50 as India collapsed to 164 all out and a 51-run loss to New Zealand . In another match , he took his ODI career best of 5 \/ 27 against Zimbabwe in Harare as the hosts fell for 65 . Despite his overall good form , Pathan was punished by the New Zealanders in the final , conceding 40 runs in five wicketless overs as India lost their second successive final . He was subsequently the leading wicket-taker as India took a 2 \u2013 0 clean sweep of an away Test series against Zimbabwe . In the First Test in Bulawayo , Pathan took 5 \/ 58 and 4 \/ 53 as well as scoring 52 in a man of the match performance to help India to an innings victory . He followed this with a 7 \/ 59 haul , his Test career best innings haul , and 5 \/ 67 in the final Test in Harare , his second ten-wicket match haul to set up a ten wicket victory , having also scored 32 in the first innings . He was again named man of the match , and his 21 wickets at 11.29 runs saw him named man of the series . This made him only the third bowler after Anil Kumble and Johnny Briggs to take 21 wickets in a two-match series . Upon the team 's return to India , Chappell experimented with Pathan by using him as an opening batsman in the Challenger Trophy prior to the late 2005 series against Sri Lankan cricket team . This yielded only moderate success with scores of 28 and 11 not out . Pathan took six wickets at 29.16 at an economy rate of 5.17 . Pathan was subsequently used at No. 3 in the batting line-up in the First ODI against Sri Lanka in Nagpur , where he scored 83 runs from 70 balls to help India post a total of 6 \/ 350 . Pathan also took 4 \/ 37 and 3 \/ 38 in the second and seventh matches at Mohali and Baroda respectively to win two-man of the match awards , taking ten wickets at 25.60 at ane economy rate of 5.22 for the whole series . He added a 35 in the final match and ended the series with 118 runs at 39.33 , playing akey role in India 's 6 \u2013 1 triumph . Pathan continued his strong ODI form with another man of the match performance of 3 \/ 23 and a knock of 37 runs against South Africa in the second ODI in Bangalore , having scored 46 in the middle-order in the first match after a top-order collapse . He ended the series with six wickets at 20.33 at an economy rate of 4.69 and 83 runs at 27.66 . After scoring two consecutive ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka , Pathan was elevated to opening in the second innings of the Second Test in Delhi , after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness . Having taken 3 \/ 34 from 22 overs in the first innings , Pathan scored 93 runs , building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436 . In the following match in Ahmedabad , he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall during the first half of the opening day . He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series , which India won 2 \u2013 0 . Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century . Following his strong performances in 2005 , Pathan was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India . Pathan had another difficult start to the new year in 2006 on the Test tour to Pakistan . In the first two Test matches played on flat surfaces in Lahore and Faisalabad , he had little success against the Pakistani batsmen , taking a total of two wickets while conceding 319 runs at more than four runs an over . After not getting an opportunity in the First Test \u2014 India lost only one wicket \u2014 Pathan made use of the good batting conditions himself and scored 90 in a double century partnership with wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Faisalabad . Pathan found success with the ball in the Third Test in Karachi , when on 29 January , he became the first person to claim a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match \u2014 the first five minutes of a match scheduled for 30 hours \u2014 and the first Indian to take a hat-trick in an away Test . It was also the highest in terms of total averages of the batsmen dismissed ( 130.18 : Salman Butt 34.27 , Younis Khan 46.04 , Mohammad Yousuf 49.86 ) and came after 1783 Tests in the history of cricket . He had Butt caught by Dravid in the slips from an outswinger , before trapping Younis leg before wicket and bowling Yousuf , both with inswingers . He finished with a haul of 5 \/ 61 after the hosts staged a lower-order counter-attack but was punished in the second innings , taking 1 wicket while conceding 106 runs as Pakistan set a target which was beyond India 's reach . Pathan ended the series with 134 runs at 44.66 and took eight wickets at 60.75 . Despite his Test travails , Pathan continued to perform strongly in the ODI arena , scoring 65 in the top order in the first ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar before making three consecutive three wicket hauls in the following matches . This included a man of the match performance that included a haul of 3 wickets for 43 runs at Rawalpindi as he claimed nine wickets at 18.88 at an economy rate of 4.49 for the series . Having taken an unassailable 3 \u2013 1 lead , India rested Pathan for the final match . Pathan had a quiet series against England following his return to India , taking 8 wickets at an average of 39.37 runs and scoring 121 runs at an average of 24.20 runs in three Tests . Pathan scored 52 in the first innings of the Second Test in Mohali , helping India to a first-innings lead and eventually a nine-wicket win . In the Third Test , Pathan managed only 1 \/ 84 in total and scored 26 and 6 as they collapsed on the final day and ceded their series lead . Again his ODI form was unaffected , taking eleven wickets at 15.63 in five matches , and scoring 123 runs at 41.00 with the bat as India easily claimed the series 5 \u2013 1 . Pathan scored 28 and then took 3 \/ 21 in a low-scoring 29-win in the first match , before scoring 36 and taking 4 \/ 51 in the third match in Goa . India then took an unassailable 4 \u2013 0 lead by winning the fourth match , in which Pathan took 1 \/ 27 before scoring 46 in the run-chase . = = International omission = = Pathan began to suffer a loss of form during the tour of the West Indies in May 2006 , when he managed only 24 runs at 6.00 and took 6 wickets at 29.83 at an economy rate of 5.59 while bowling in the ODI arena as India lost the series 4 \u2013 1 . After a poor display in a tour match , in which he was hit for 70 runs in 12 overs and appeared jaded , he was dropped from the Test team as V. R. V. Singh became the third place bowler and captain Rahul Dravid scrapped the five bowler strategy . Pathan only played once in the Second Test , after Sreesanth was sidelined due to injury . He scored 19 and took 1 \/ 43 and 1 \/ 50 as India enforced the follow on but the hosts hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand . India then selected two spinners in the last two Tests , and Pathan could not gain one of the two pace positions . Chappell stated that Pathan was fatigued and had been overworked but was confident that Pathan \" would recover from his slump and rise to further heights \" , asserting that he was still young and learning . Former India paceman Javagal Srinath expressed concern about Pathan 's dwindling pace , but expressed that swing was the first priority in backing Pathan 's return to international cricket . These concerns were further magnified in late 2006 , when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs in the first two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia . Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies , Pathan was dropped for the rest of the tournament . He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches . Pathan was then demoted from the position of an opening bowler in ODIs during the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy ; he took four wickets at 24.00 at an economy rate of 4.80 , and scored only 29 runs at 9.66 , as India were knocked out in the first round . Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late-2006 tour to South Africa . Playing in three of the five matches , he took a solitary wicket at 136.00 , conceding 7.15 runs per over , the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 as India were skittled for 163 in one match ; they were whitewashed by the hosts . Since the West Indies tour in May 2006 , Pathan had only been taking wickets at 41.33 . He subsequently fell out of the Top 10 of the ICC bowling rankings and the Top 5 of the All rounder rankings after having spent the previous year on the list . Despite this , Indian captain Rahul Dravid remained optimistic about Pathan 's prospects , stating \" The number of Man-of-the-Matches that Irfan has won is a testimony to the fact that he 's a proven matchwinner for us . He takes wickets early , contributes with the bat , is good in the field . \" Despite top scoring in both innings of a first-class warm-up match in Potchefstroom , scoring 111 not out and 40 not out whilst many specialist batsmen failed to cope with the bouncy conditions , he totalled only 1 \/ 49 from eight overs with the ball and was overlooked by the selectors for the First Test in Johannesburg . This indicated that although he had scored 560 runs at 35.00 under Chappell 's coaching , they saw bowling , which had been steadily declining , as his primary responsibility . After a poor bowling display in the subsequent tour match in which he conceded 74 runs in only 11 overs , Pathan became the first player to be sent home by the BCCI during a tour for poor performance rather than indiscipline . It was later revealed by Kiran More that it was a mutual agreement so that Pathan could play for Baroda in the final two rounds of Ranji Trophy in an attempt to regain form via match practice instead of watching the final two Tests from the sidelines . He subsequently led Baroda to the semi-finals after scoring 82 * to help defeat Uttar Pradesh by five wickets , but his bowling remained ineffective , returning figures of 2 \/ 108 and 1 \/ 59 , conceding 4.77 runs per over . Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar attributed Pathan 's situation to mismanagement , asserting that Pathan has been \" messed about \" as well as insinuating foul play . Pathan 's fortunes improved in the next two matches , totalling 5 \/ 92 and 7 \/ 96 against Tamil Nadu and Mumbai respectively . Pathan was initially dropped for the ODI series hosted by India against the West Indies , but was recalled for the final match in his home town after claiming seven wickets against Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi-final . His performance was regarded as lacklustre , taking 1 \/ 43 from seven overs . The selectors persisted and named him in the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , but injury stopped him from playing in the ODI series against Sri Lanka , denying him an opportunity to regain form . Pathan on his return took two wickets of the overs which he bowled.He had an impressive start as he took the wicket of Lendle Simons as a Leg Before Wicket . After taking 1 \/ 12 and 3 \/ 25 in warm-up matches against the Netherlands and the West Indies in the Caribbean , Pathan did not play a match at the World Cup , and was among a group of players to be dropped from the squad following India 's exit from the first round . He played no part in the tours of Bangladesh and England . Instead , he was sent on an India A tour of Africa . Two years after devastating the Zimbabwean batsmen , he played against a Zimbabwe Select XI , he took only six wickets at 30.16 in two matches , and then took eight wickets at 18.12 in two matches against Kenya . India won all four matches , and Pathan scored 87 runs at 21.75 . Pathan then took six wickets at 23.83 and scored 93 runs at 31.00 in four one-dayers . = = International comeback = = With India 's older players opting out of the inaugural World Twenty20 , Pathan was one of several younger players to regain national selection . India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides . In the first match , he scored 20 and took 2 \/ 20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round , before winning in a bowl-out . He then took 0 \/ 16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3 \/ 37 in a defeat of England . India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs , helping to restrict the hosts to 9 \/ 116 in pursuit of 154 . Pathan then took 2 \/ 44 , removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals . India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final . Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3 \/ 16 , including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls , before later bowling Yasir Arafat . As a result of his performances in South Africa , Pathan was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007 . He played in all 12 matches , seven against Australia and five against Pakistan . Pathan scored 131 runs at 18.71 in the lower-order and took 12 wickets at 46.00 at an economy rate of 5.02 , averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics . It was a steady performance ; Pathan never took more than two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4.60 and 6.66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan . With India opting to field two spinners and two pacemen on turning tracks in the home Test series against Pakistan in late 2007 , Pathan missed the first two Tests as Zaheer and Rudra Pratap Singh were the fast bowlers chosen . In the meantime , he took 11 wickets at 23.81 and scored 90 runs at 30.00 in two Ranji Trophy matches . Injury to both Zaheer and Singh in his colleagues resulted in his recall for the Third Test at Bangalore . Pathan scored his maiden Test century , reaching the mark with a six from leg spinner Danish Kaneria to move from 96 to 102 with only last man , paceman Ishant Sharma left to accompany him , before holing out in the same over . He made 21 not out in the second innings but was unpenetrative with the ball , taking a total of 1 \/ 110 as the tourists hung on for a draw . Pathan gained selection for the 2007 \u2013 08 tour of Australia , but did not play in the first two Tests with only two pacemen chosen . Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant , who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test . With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth , Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh . He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively . His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day . After entering at the fall of the first wicket , he batted for more than two hours and was the sixth man to fall . Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball , taking 2 \/ 63 and 3 \/ 54 , including both Australian openers in each innings , having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored . He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw . India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award . After his batting displays in Perth , Pathan was promoted to open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide , replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five-bowler attack . In a high-scoring match , Pathan took 3 \/ 112 , but he struggled with the responsibility of opening , scoring nine and a duck . In a high-scoring match , he took 3 \/ 112 in Australia 's 563.Following the Test series , he top-scored with 26 as India were skittles for 74 in the one-off T20 international . Pathan held his place in the ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy , scoring 118 runs at 19.66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34.27 at an economy rate of 5.49 . His best performance was a 4 \/ 41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50-run loss . His top-score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run-chase against Sri Lanka . Pathan struggled in the two finals against Australia , taking three wickets at 39.00 at an economy rate of 7.46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2 \u2013 0 win . An extra bowler backfired as the batsmen struggled . Pathan top-scored with 21 * in India 's first innings of 76 on the first morning and was again unbeaten in the second innings with 43 . However , he failed to take a wicket and conceded 85 runs in only 21.2 overs in an innings defeat , and was omitted from the next Test . After the South Africa series , Pathan participated in the 2008 Indian Premier League , having been purchased by the Kings XI Punjab . He took 15 wickets at 23.33 at the economy rate of 6.60 runs per over . His most effective performance came when he added an unbeaten 24 and took 2 \/ 18 from his four overs to help Punjab to a nine-run win over the Kolkata Knight Riders . He scored 131 runs at 21.83 and added 40 in a failed run-chase against Chennai Super Kings . = = Back on the fringes = = Following the IPL , Pathan resumed international duties in the Kitply Cup and the 2008 Asia Cup . He had an unproductive time with the ball ; although he scored a total of 86 runs at 28.66 , he took seven wickets at 51.42 at an economy rate of 6.56 . Pathan was overlooked for the Tests in Sri Lanka but was called into the team for the one-dayers , but played in only three of the five fixtures . He took three wickets at 34.66 , conceding 5.20 runs an over , and struggled with the bat , scoring 19 runs at 6.33 as the Indian batting collapsed in each match . He was then included in an India A team for a series of matches against touring counterparts from New Zealand and Australia . He had average results , taking four wickets at 43.75 and an economy rate of 4.86 , and scored 56 runs at 18.66 in four games . He did better the Challenger Trophy , taking six wickets at 14.00 at an economy rate of 3.42 , and scored 71 runs at 35.50 as India Blue won all three matches . At the start of the first-class season , Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1 \/ 91 for the Board President 's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series , and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen . He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy . He played in four matches and performed strongly , taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20 . He started the season with 6 \/ 85 and 1 \/ 34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh , and then took 4 \/ 42 and 1 \/ 46 against Railways . He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra . Pathan took 5 \/ 64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead . After taking 1 \/ 61 in the second innings , he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand . In his final Ranji fixture for the season , he took 7 \/ 35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77 , setting up an innings win . However , with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy , Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England . Pathan 's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty . Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs , he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4 \u2013 0 series lead . He took 0 \/ 57 from ten overs in the fifth match , as India recorded another victory , but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled . Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka , but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3 \u2013 0 lead . He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches , but was again expensive , conceding 7.06 runs an over . However , he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand that saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry ; Irfan ended on 33 not out . Pathan returned to India and took 3 \/ 50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season , which ended in a win , before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand . Pathan had a poor time in New Zealand . In the two T20 internationals preceding the ODIs , he took 0 \/ 38 and 2 \/ 41 , conceding his runs at an alarming economy rate of 11.28 . He was left out of all five ODIs during the tour before heading home . He then played in all 14 of Punjab 's round-robin matches in the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa , taking 17 wickets at 22.94 with an economy rate of 7.74 , and scored 196 runs at 19.60 . He started strongly , taking nine wickets in four matches in the early stages of the tournament , before taking only two in the next five matches , and ending with six in the last three fixtures . Punjab failed to make the semi-finals . Pathan 's performances in the IPL were enough for him to retain his position in the national T20 team after his performances in New Zealand , and he then proceeded to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June , where India were seeking to defend their title . He struggled in the warm-up matches , totalling 1 \/ 49 in five overs , and again in the first round of matches , bowling five overs and conceding 42 runs without success . Nevertheless , India defeated both Bangladesh and Ireland to move into the next round . He took 1 \/ 9 from two overs in the loss to the West Indies in the Super 8 round , and was left out for the remaining two matches , which India lost to be eliminated . Since then , Pathan was dropped from the limited overs team and was then injured for an extended period , until he made his return to cricket in the Ranji Trophy in November . He played in six matches for Baroda as captain and was successful with both bat and ball , scoring 397 runs at 49.62 and taking 22 wickets at 18.54 . In his most productive first-class season with the bat , Pathan made starts in eight of his nine innings , only failing to reach 24 once , and scoring four fifties , although he was unable to convert any to triple figures . In his fourth match of the season , Pathan top-scored in both innings with 68 and 81 as Baroda lost to Karnataka by an innings after making 153 and 223 . He then took a total of 7 \/ 76 and scored 65 not out to secure a seven-wicket win over Saurashtra , and then totalled 7 \/ 96 in a seven-wicket triumph over Maharashtra . However , these performances were not enough to earn Pathan a Test recall . Furthermore , on 25 February 2010 the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced its list of 30 probables for the T20 World Cup to be held in the West Indies , the most notable omission being Irfan Pathan . Pathan took 5 \/ 100 in the first innings of the Duleep Trophy final against South Zone . His fifth wicket brought up his 300th scalp at first-class level . After cricket was engulfed in a series of corruption scandals in September 2010 , Pathan told the media that he had received \" three expensive gifts in his room \" and , later , two further gifts that he could not afford . Pathan reported this to the team management as he thought the gifts might be from a bookmaker . = = Comeback to the national side and knee injury = = Irfan Pathan was recalled for India 's ODI squad for last two matches of five match one-day series against West Indies in December 2011 , and played in last match of the series , picking the wicket of first ball . He was selected for the Commonwealth Bank Series , playing four games and scoring 96 runs at an average of 24 with a top score of 47 . He also succeeded in taking 6 wickets at an average of 31.16 ; his best figures were 3 \/ 16 . His strong performances led to his inclusion in the Asia Cup squad . He played three matches and did not get a chance to bat but he proved himself with the ball taking 4 \/ 32 in the first match of the series against Sri Lanka . He picked up two more wickets in the next two games . He was the part of the team touring South Africa for the one T20 played on 31 March 2012 where he had figures of 4 \u2013 0 \u2013 44 \u2013 1 but was yet to bat . Pathan also played for the Delhi Daredevils the Indian Premier League in 2012 , taking only 8 wickets from 17 matches with an average of 58.12 . BCCI announced on 13 July 2012 inclusion of Irfan Pathan in the Indian team for the tour of Sri Lanka as a replacement to the injured Vinay Kumar . With his all round performance , India managed to win four of the five ODIs and the lone T20 match in the next series in Sri Lanka . Pathan emerged as the top wicket taker with a 5-wicket haul . Irfan Pathan was a part of the Indian squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka . In the Ranji Trophy 2012 \u2013 13 opener against Karnataka , Pathan raised his First-class top-score to 121 with his 3rd domestic hundred . But , he injured his knee during match and only made comeback to cricket in March 2013 . In 2014 he was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad to play in the Indian Premier League . = = Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa = = Pathan became a contestant on the Colors TV popular dance show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa in the 8th season in 2015 .

        "doc": "Russian battleship Tsesarevich = Tsesarevich ( Russian : \u0426\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 ) was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy , built in France at the end of the 19th century . The ship 's design formed the basis of the Russian-built Borodino-class battleships . She was based at Port Arthur , Manchuria after entering service and fought in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 \u2013 05 . Tsesarevich was the flagship of Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft in the Battle of the Yellow Sea and was interned in Tsingtau after the battle . After the end of the war , the ship was transferred to the Baltic Fleet and helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in mid-1906 . While on a Mediterranean cruise , she helped survivors of the 1908 Messina earthquake . Tsesarevich was not very active during the early part of World War I and her bored sailors joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in early 1917 . Now named Grazhdanin , the ship participated in the Battle of Moon Sound in 1917 , during which she was lightly damaged . The ship seized by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution in late 1917 and decommissioned the following year . Grazhdanin was scrapped in 1924 \u2013 1925 . = = Design and description = = The ship was ordered as part of the \" Programme for the Needs of the Far East \" , authorised by Tsar Nicholas II in 1898 to defend Russia 's newly acquired ice-free port of Port Arthur in Manchuria . Russian shipyards were already at full capacity so the Naval Ministry decided to order ships from abroad . Specifications were issued on 14 June 1898 and a few days later the chief designer of the French shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e proposed a design based on that of the French battleship Jaur\u00e9guiberry . The Naval Technical Committee approved the design with a few changes to which the French readily agreed . The General Admiral , Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich selected the French design over a competing proposal from the Baltic Works . A contract was signed on 20 July 1898 at a cost of 30.28 million francs ( 11.355 million rubles ) for delivery in 42 months . Tsesarevich 's most obvious design feature was her tumblehome hull . This had several advantages because it allowed greater freeboard since the narrow upper decks reduced the structural weight of the vessel 's hull , it increased the field of fire of guns mounted on the sides , and it reduced the ship 's roll in heavy seas . Its great disadvantage was that it reduced buoyancy and stability which contributed to excessive heel during turns . During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904 , Imperial Japanese Navy observers thought the Tsesarevich was going to capsize when she suddenly turned out of the battleline . Tsesarevich was 118.5 metres ( 388 ft 9 in ) long overall , had a beam of 23.2 metres ( 76 ft 1 in ) and a draught of 7.92 metres ( 26 ft 0 in ) . The ship displaced 13,105 tonnes ( 12,898 long tons ) . Her crew consisted of 28 \u2013 29 officers and 750 enlisted men . The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers at a working pressure of 19 kg \/ cm2 ( 1,863 kPa ; 270 psi ) . The boilers were fitted with economizers that preheated their feed water . The engines were rated at 16,300 indicated horsepower ( 12,200 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km \/ h ; 21 mph ) . Tsesarevich handily exceeded her design speed and reached 18.77 knots ( 34.76 km \/ h ; 21.60 mph ) from 15,254 indicated horsepower ( 11,375 kW ) during her official machinery trials in July \u2013 August 1903 . She normally carried 800 long tons ( 810 t ) of coal , but could carry a maximum of 1,350 long tons ( 1,370 t ) . This allowed the ship to steam for 5,500 nautical miles ( 10,200 km ; 6,300 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km \/ h ; 12 mph ) . Tsesarevich was fitted with six steam-driven generators with a total capacity of 550 kilowatts ( 740 hp ) . = = = Armament and fire control = = = Tsesarevich 's main armament consisted of two pairs of 40-calibre 12-inch guns mounted in center-pivot , electrically powered , twin-gun turrets fore and aft . The guns and their mountings were Russian-built , but the turrets themselves were made in France . The guns could be loaded at all angles of elevation and the turrets could traverse 270 \u00b0 . Trials revealed that the ammunition hoists tended to jam when the ship was rolling ; the shipyard shipped new hoists to Port Arthur because the Russians wanted the ship in the Far East as soon as possible and they were installed in January 1904 . 70 rounds per gun were carried . The guns fired one shell every 90 \u2013 132 seconds . They fired a 731.3-pound ( 331.7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,598 ft \/ s ( 792 m \/ s ) to a range of 16,010 yards ( 14,640 m ) at an elevation of 15 \u00b0 . The secondary armament of the ships consisted of a dozen 45-caliber Canet Model 1892 6-inch ( 150 mm ) ( QF ) guns mounted in six electrically powered twin-gun turrets on the upper deck . The corner turrets had an 150 \u00b0 arc of fire and the center turrets could cover 180 \u00b0 . Each six-inch gun was provided with 200 rounds . Their rate of fire was 2 \u2013 4 rounds per minute . They fired shells that weighed 91 lb ( 41.4 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2,600 ft \/ s ( 792.5 m \/ s ) . They had a maximum range of approximately 12,600 yards ( 11,500 m ) . A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included twenty 50-calibre Canet QF 75-millimetre ( 3.0 in ) guns ; 14 in hull embrasures and the remaining six mounted on the superstructure . The ship carried 300 shells for each gun . They fired a 11-pound ( 4.9 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,700 ft \/ s ( 820 m \/ s ) to a maximum range of 7,005 yards ( 6,405 m ) at an elevation of 13 \u00b0 . Tsesarevich also mounted twenty 47-millimetre ( 1.9 in ) Hotchkiss guns in the superstructure . They fired a 2.2-pound ( 1.00 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1,400 ft \/ s ( 430 m \/ s ) at a rate of around 15 rounds per minute . Eight smaller 37-millimetre ( 1.5 in ) Hotchkiss guns were also fitted , but their locations are unknown . The ship carried four 381-millimetre ( 15.0 in ) torpedo tubes ; two of these were mounted above water in the bow and stern , and the two broadside underwater tubes were located near the forward 12-inch magazine . Tsesarevich carried a total of 14 torpedoes . The ship also carried 45 mines to be laid to protect her anchorage in remote areas . The ship was fitted with two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images that had to be superimposed to derive the range . The gunnery officer then calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target and transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each turret . = = = Protection = = = Tsesarevich used the latest Krupp armor in a version of the French cellular armor scheme . This consisted of a full-length waterline armoured belt with armored decks above and below . Behind the belt were well-subdivided compartments mostly used to store coal . This was intended to keep the ship afloat regardless of the damage inflicted above the upper armoured deck . The waterline armor belt was 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) high , with 1.5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) below the waterline at normal load . It had a maximum thickness of 250 millimetres ( 9.8 in ) for a length of 60 metres ( 196 ft 10 in ) amidships which gradually reduced to a thickness of 180 millimetres ( 7.1 in ) at the bow and 170 millimetres ( 6.7 in ) at the stern . The belt tapered to a thickness of 170 millimetres at its bottom edge amidships and presumably tapered proportionally along its length . Above the waterline belt was an upper strake of armour that was 1.67 metres ( 5 ft 6 in ) high and had a maximum thickness of 200 millimetres ( 7.9 in ) . It was slightly shorter than the waterline belt and similarly reduced in thickness towards the ends of the ship . Forward it consisted of 120-millimetre ( 4.7 in ) armour plates and 130 millimetres ( 5.1 in ) aft . The armor of the main gun turrets and their supporting tubes was 250 millimetres thick with roofs 63 millimetres ( 2.5 in ) thick . Below the upper armour deck the armour of the support tubes decreased to 100 millimetres ( 3.9 in ) . The turrets of the secondary armament had 150-millimetre ( 5.9 in ) sides with 30 millimetres ( 1.2 in ) roofs . The sides of the conning tower were 254 millimetres ( 10.0 in ) thick and it had a 63-millimetre roof . It had a communications tube that extended down to the upper armoured deck that was protected by 100-millimetre armour . The funnel uptakes were protected by 19 millimetres ( 0.7 in ) of armour for the height of one deck above the upper armoured deck . Above the upper armour belt there was a deck that ran the full length of the ship that consisted of a 50-millimetre ( 2.0 in ) armour plate laid on 10-millimetre ( 0.39 in ) deck plating . At the top of the waterline belt was two layers of 20-millimetre ( 0.79 in ) armour . It also extended the full length of the ship , but not the full width ; it curved downward behind the belt and was connected to the lower edge of the belt by a 20-millimetre plate . It continued downward to the ship 's inner bottom plates and formed a sort of torpedo bulkhead . This bulkhead was 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) from the side of the ship and extended for a length of 84 metres ( 275 ft 7 in ) . It was backed with coal bunkers . = = Construction and service = = Construction began on Tsesarevich , named after the title of the heir to the Russian throne , on 18 May 1899 at the Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e shipyard in La Seyne-sur-Mer , France . The ship was laid down on 8 July 1899 and launched on 23 February 1901 . Construction was supervised by Captain Ivan Grigorovich , who became the ship 's first captain . Tsesarevich entered service in August 1903 and was assigned to the Far East . She arrived in Port Arthur on 2 December 1903 . Upon completion , the Tsesarevich was the Russian Navy 's best battleship at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War . = = = Russo-Japanese War = = = She was one of three ships to be struck by Japanese torpedoes during the surprise attack on Port Arthur during the night of 8 \/ 9 February 1904 . Tsesarevich was hit abaft the portside torpedo bulkhead and the ship took on an 18 \u00b0 list that was partially corrected by counterflooding compartments on the starboard side . She got underway , but ran aground at the narrow harbor entrance . She was refloated and moved into the harbour for repairs that lasted until 7 June . Some of the ship 's guns were removed during the summer to reinforce the defenses of the port . Tsesarevich lost a total of four 75-millimeter , two 47-millimeter and two 37-millimeter guns . The ship was hit twice on 7 August by Japanese 4.7-inch ( 120 mm ) shells fired at long range ; a fragment from one of them lightly wounded Vitgeft . On the morning of 10 August 1904 , the First Pacific Squadron sortied from Port Arthur in an attempt to break through the Japanese fleet blockading the port and reach Vladivostok . The Russian squadron consisted of six battleships , Tsesarevich , Retvizan , Pobeda , Peresvet , Sevastopol and Poltava , along with four protected cruisers and eight destroyers . The Japanese fleet , commanded by Admiral Togo , was comprised four battleships , Mikasa , Asahi , Fuji , Shikishima , two armoured cruisers Nishin and Kasuga , as well as seven protected cruisers . Tsesarevich and Pobeda both suffered mechanical problems within an hour of departure that forced the fleet to slow down to a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km \/ h ; 15 mph ) . Togo failed in his attempt to cross the Russian 's T after spotting them around 12 : 25 and a general engagement began around 13 : 25 with the Japanese ships concentrating their fire on Tsesarevich and Retvizan , but the effective Russian fire forced Togo to disengage around 15 : 20 . He closed with the Russians about two hours later and opened fire at 17 : 35 . Neither side was able to mortally damage any ships while the Russians were still in the lead with about a half-hour of daylight left when two 12-inch shells fired by Asahi struck near Tsesarevich 's conning tower at 18 : 40 . Shell fragments bounced off the conning tower 's overhanging roof into the conning tower , killing Vitgeft , two staff officers and the helmsman . The ship turned to port with the steering wheel jammed and was followed by several other battleships . Tsesarevich became the focus of attention from every Japanese ship so the captain of Retvizan decided to charge the Japanese battleline to buy time for Tsesarevich to fix her steering problem . He succeeded in doing so and the squadron 's second-in-command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky gradually asserted command over the scattered Russian ships and ordered them back to Port Arthur in the darkness . Tsesarevich attempted to head north to Vladivostok in the dark , but her damaged funnels greatly increased her coal consumption and reduced her speed to only 6 knots ( 11 km \/ h ; 6.9 mph ) so that she was forced to head for the German treaty port of Tsingtau instead with three destroyers for escort . Upon arrival the following day , Tsesarevich and her companions were interned and disarmed . The ship had been hit by thirteen 12-inch and two 8-inch ( 200 mm ) shells that killed 12 and wounded 47 members of her crew . = = = Post Russo-Japanese War and WWI = = = At the end of the Russo-Japanese war , the ship was transferred to the Baltic in early 1906 and helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion later that year . Around 1906 , her fighting top was removed and her superstructure was cut down . The 75 mm guns in the superstructure were apparently removed as well . Tsesarevich made regular winter cruises to the Mediterranean before World War I and aided survivors of the Messina earthquake in December 1908 . In 1909 \u2013 10 the ship 's machinery was overhauled and her amidships casemated 75 mm guns were removed and plated over four years later . Tsesarevich was not very active during the early part of World War I and she reportedly received two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns during the war . Because of her inactivity her bored sailors joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in early 1917 . She was renamed Grazhdanin ( Russian : \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d ( meaning Citizen ) ) on 13 April 1917 after the February Revolution . The ship took part in the Battle of Moon Sound in October 1917 . During the climatic part of the battle , Grazhdanin engaged the German minesweepers on 17 October with little effect while Slava engaged the German dreadnoughts K\u00f6nig and Kronprinz . The latter fired at Grazhdanin and hit her twice , killing one and wounding four crewmen , although neither hit caused significant damage . The German dreadnoughts outranged Grazhdanin , and she was forced to retreat and abandon Moon Sound in the face of German pressure . By December the ship was in Kronstadt , where she came under the control of the Bolsheviks , and she was hulked there in May 1918 . Grazhdanin was scrapped beginning in 1924 , although she was not officially stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925 .",

She was based at Port Arthur, Manchuria after entering service and fought in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 \u2013 05. Tsesarevich was the flagship of Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft in the Battle of the Yellow Sea and was interned in Tsingtau after the battle.

He was involved in the investigation of the Port Chicago disaster , served with Project Alberta on Tinian , and was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage . After the war , Reynolds began a long academic career at Princeton University . He was director of the Princeton 's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 until 1970 , when he became the first director of Princeton 's new Center for Environmental Studies . He combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole , Massachusetts , where he studied marine bioluminescence . He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution . = = Early life = = George Thomas Reynolds was born in Trenton , New Jersey on May 27 , 1917 , the son of George W. Reynolds , a trainmaster for the Pennsylvania Railroad , and his wife Laura , a secretary with the New Jersey Department of Geology . He attended Franklin Junior High School in Highland Park , New Jersey , until year 10 , and then New Brunswick High School . He received a bachelor 's degree in physics from Rutgers University in 1939 . He then entered Princeton University , where was awarded a master of science degree in 1942 . He earned his PhD in 1943 under the supervision of Walker Bleakney , writing his thesis \" Studies in the production , propagation , and interactions of shock waves \" . = = Manhattan Project = = World War II was raging at this time , and someone with a doctorate in such a topic area was highly sought after by the wartime Manhattan Project , but Reynolds turned down an offer to join it . An avid surf fisherman and sailor , he aspired to join the United States Navy . He attempted to enlist , but was turned down because he wore glasses . He then lobbied the Navy , which waived this requirement . He was then commissioned as an ensign in 1943 , and married Virginia Rendall , a librarian , while he waited for his first assignment . Instead of the seafaring assignment he hoped for , Reynolds was sent to the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky in the design of the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon . In April 1944 , Kistiakowsky named Reynolds as one of eleven men that he would like to have working for him at Los Alamos . Reynolds was one of the naval officers who was sent to investigate the Port Chicago disaster , in which an ammunition ship had blown up in the harbor . He was tasked with estimating the size of the explosion , based upon observations of the damage . His estimate was 1,550 tons of TNT ( 6,500 GJ ) \u00b1 50 tons of TNT ( 210 GJ ) tons . A bill of lading was subsequently found for 1,540 tons , confirming his estimate . Reynolds was one of several researchers who determined that an atomic bomb would do maximum damage if detonated in the air rather than at ground level . He later served with Project Alberta , the part of the Manhattan Project for operations in the field . He served on Tinian , where the worked with the X-Unit Section , which was responsible for the Fat Man bomb 's firing unit . He flew a number of practice missions , but not the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki . After the fighting ended , he was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage . = = Princeton = = After the war , Reynolds accepted an offer of an assistant professorship at Princeton University . He would spend the rest of his career there , being promoted to associate professor in 1951 , and then to professor in 1959 . John Archibald Wheeler interested him in cosmic rays . Reybolds was director of the Princeton 's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 to 1970 . He initially recruited Ronald Rau from Caltech and Joseph Ballam from the University of California . Ballam eventually became a professor and division head at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , while Rau went on to become Chairman of the Physics Department at the Brookhaven National Laboratory . Reynolds later hired Sam Treiman , Giorgio Salvini , Riccardo Giacconi , Val Fitch and Jim Cronin . His reputation for spotting and hiring talent was assured when Giacconi , Fitch and Cronin won Nobel Prizes . For his cosmic ray research , Reynolds attempted to grow large organic crystal scintillators to use as ionized particle detectors . Scintillators are luminescent materials that , when struck by an incoming particle , absorb its energy and scintillate \u2013 emit light . They are used in many areas of scientific research . He was frustrated by cracks in the crystals , and attempted to get around the problem by dissolving them in liquid . To the surprise of many , the liquid was just as effective as crystal scintillators . Today , liquid scintillators are in widespread use in nuclear , biological and medical research . He also developed automated X-ray detectors for collecting data on protein structures . Interest in environmental issues increased in the late 1960s , and in 1970 , Princeton established Princeton 's Center for Environmental Studies . Reynolds was appointed as its first director . Under his leadership , it investigated a number of unusual inter-disciplinary topics , such as energy conservation in buildings , indoor air quality , the relationship between nuclear power and nuclear weapons , and the decision-making process in environmental issues Although most of his career was at Princeton , he spent some time in England , where was a Churchill Fellow at Cambridge University in 1973 and 1974 . He was later a visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Oxford University , and a visiting professor at Oxford Research Unit of the Open University , from 1981 to 1982 , and a Royal Society Guest Research Fellow at Oxford University in 1985 . Reynolds became the Class of 1909 Professor of Physics in 1978 , and Professor Emeritus 1987 . For 31 years he combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole , Massachusetts , where he studied marine bioluminescence .

Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , and began performing for local TV children 's shows in his hometown of Baltimore , Maryland , as a teenager . In the early 1980s , he began working in Captain Kangaroo , and began performing in Sesame Street in 1984 . He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo , the character he became the most famous for , and became an executive producer and director for the show . Clash worked in various productions for the Muppets and Jim Henson Productions and in other projects . He resigned from Sesame Street in late 2012 , after allegations of sexual impropriety , which he denied and were dismissed due to statute of limitations expiring . Clash wrote an autobiography , My Life as a Furry Red Monster , which was published in 2006 , and also featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = Early years = = Kevin Clash was born in Baltimore , Maryland , on September 17 , 1960 , the third of four children born to George Clash , a flash welder and handyman , and Gladys Clash , who ran a small daycare center in their two-bedroom , one-bath home in the Turner Station of Dundalk , Maryland . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , inspired by children 's shows like Kukla , Fran and Ollie and Sesame Street . He made his first puppet , a version of Mickey Mouse , at the age of 10 . When he was twelve , he created a monkey puppet out of the lining of his father 's coat . His first performances were for his mother 's daycare children . By the time he was a teenager , he had built almost 90 puppets , which he based upon commercials , popular music , and his friends . While still in high school , Clash performed at venues throughout Baltimore , including schools , churches , fundraisers , and community events . While appearing at a neighborhood festival , Clash was discovered by Baltimore television personality Stu Kerr , who became Clash 's first mentor and hired him to perform in the children 's show Caboose at Channel 2 . Clash also built puppets for the Romper Room franchise . When he was 17 , he contacted and met puppeteer Kermit Love , who became Clash 's mentor , after seeing Love featured in an episode of the documentary Call It Macaroni . In 1979 , on Love 's recommendation , Clash appeared as Cookie Monster in the Sesame Street float during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Parade , and met Jim Henson , who later became his boss , mentor , and friend . When he was nineteen , Clash became a puppeteer for Captain Kangaroo , initially as a guest performer , in which he also made occasional on-camera appearances . The producers of Captain Kangaroo used some of Clash 's puppet creations for the show . In 1984 , Clash had to turn down Henson 's offer to work on his film The Dark Crystal because he was working on two TV shows at the same time , Captain Kangaroo and Love 's syndicated program The Great Space Coaster , in which he was producer for the first time . = = Career = = Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons , and Great Space Coaster ended , freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street . Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983 , mostly performing nondescript , stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets . Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl ( based on Louis Armstrong ) , the infant Baby Natasha , and inventor Dr. Nobel Price . After 1985 , Elmo , a furry red monster , became his main character . Four puppeteers , including Richard Hunt , had performed Elmo previously , but it was Clash 's development , with a falsetto voice , that established the character . He based Elmo 's character on the preschool children that attended his mother 's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents . Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz , who told Clash to always \" find one special hook \" for each character . Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he \" should represent love \" . After the height of Elmo 's popularity , especially the \" Tickle Me Elmo \" craze in 1996 , Clash 's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased . He recruited , auditioned , and trained its puppeteers , and became the senior Muppet coordinator , a writer , director , and co-producer of the \" Elmo 's World \" segment of the show . Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street 's international co-productions . He found working with the co-productions \" a lot of fun \" and \" very rewarding \" . He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird . In 2007 , he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop . Until 2011 , he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances , making his schedule , as he called it , \" crazy \" . Cheryl Henson , president of the Jim Henson Foundation , called him \" essential \" to the show . Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , which was dedicated to Henson , in 1990 , voicing Master Splinter . He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions , including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour ( 1989 ) , and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz 's characters ( Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear , Sam the Eagle , and Animal ) in Muppet Treasure Island ( 1996 ) . Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space ( 1999 ) and The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz ( 2005 ) , and the TV series Muppets Tonight ( 1996 \u2014 1998 ) , in which he reprised Clifford , who served as the show 's host . He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs . In 1999 , Clash worked on a film starring Elmo , The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland . In 2006 , Clash published his autobiography , co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell , entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster : What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life , Love and Laughing Out Loud . His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = = Resignation from Sesame Workshop = = = In November 2012 , 23-year-old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Clash which began when Stephens was 16 . Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June , and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated . Clash acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser ; however , he characterized the relationship as being between consenting adults . Stephens later recanted his accusation , but two weeks later , another accuser , Cecil Singleton , made similar accusations and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Clash . Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20 , 2012 , and released a statement saying , \" Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work ' Sesame Street ' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer . I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately . \" Sesame Workshop also released a statement : \" Unfortunately , the controversy surrounding Kevin 's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want , and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from ' Sesame Street . ' \" They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash 's understudy and would take over his roles on the show . In July 2013 , the three cases against Clash were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash 's alleged violations during the three years after each turned 21 . Clash 's lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life . Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling , alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse weren 't fully realized until 2012 . In April 2014 , the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals . Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations , Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash , but the case ultimately was dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had ended . = = Personal life = = Clash was married for 17 years , and has a daughter who was born in 1993 . In November 2012 , Clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from the Sesame Workshop , stating , \" I am a gay man . I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter . \" Clash is African American and has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo , African-American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him . He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work , and that it came through in his performances . = = Awards and honors = = Clash won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in a Children 's Series for his work as Elmo on Sesame Street in 1990 , 2005 \u2013 2007 and 2009 \u2013 2013 . In all , he has won 27 daytime Emmys and one prime-time Emmy .

She appeared in magazine , newspaper and television advertising , before she made her debut role in the 1984 crime film Once Upon a Time in America . Connelly continued modeling and acting , starring in films such as the 1986 film Labyrinth and the 1991 films Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer . She gained critical acclaim for her work in the 1998 science fiction film Dark City and for her portrayal of Marion Silver in the 2000 drama Requiem for a Dream . In 2002 , Connelly won an Academy Award , a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award for her supporting role as Alicia Nash in Ron Howard 's 2001 biopic A Beautiful Mind . Her later credits include the 2003 Marvel superhero film Hulk where she played Bruce Banner 's true love Betty Ross , the 2005 horror film Dark Water , the 2006 drama Blood Diamond , the 2008 science fiction remake The Day the Earth Stood Still , the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That into You and the 2009 biographical drama Creation . She re-teamed with her Requiem for a Dream director Darren Aronofsky and A Beautiful Mind co-star Russell Crowe for the 2014 biblical epic Noah . Connelly was named Amnesty International Ambassador for Human Rights Education in 2005 . She has been the face of Balenciaga fashion advertisements , as well as for Revlon cosmetics . In 2012 , she was named the first global face of the Shiseido Company . Magazines including Time , Vanity Fair and Esquire , as well as the Los Angeles Times newspaper have included her on their lists of the world 's most beautiful women . = = Early life = = Connelly was born in Cairo , New York , in the Catskill Mountains . She is the daughter of Ilene , an antiques dealer , and Gerard Karl Connelly ( 1941 \u2013 2008 ) , a clothing manufacturer . Her father was Roman Catholic of Irish and Norwegian descent . Her mother was Jewish and was educated at a yeshiva ; Ilene 's family had emigrated from Poland and Russia . Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights , near the Brooklyn Bridge , where she attended Saint Ann 's , a private school specializing in the Arts . Her father suffered from asthma , so the family moved to Woodstock , New York , in 1976 to escape the city smog . Four years later , the family returned to Brooklyn Heights , and Connelly returned to Saint Ann 's . = = Career = = = = = Child modeling and early film appearances = = = When Connelly was 10 years old , an advertising executive friend of her father suggested she audition as a model . Her parents sent a picture of her to the Ford Modeling Agency , which shortly after added her to its roster . Connelly began modeling for print advertisements before moving on to television commercials . In an interview with The Guardian , she revealed that , after having done some modeling , she had no aspirations to become an actor . She appeared on the cover of several issues of Seventeen in 1986 and 1988 . In December 1986 , she recorded two pop songs for the Japanese market : \" Monologue of Love \" and \" Message of Love \" . Connelly sang in phonetic Japanese as she did not speak the language . Her mother started taking her to acting auditions . At once , Connelly was selected for a supporting role as the aspiring dancer and actress Deborah Gelly in Sergio Leone 's 1984 gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America . The role required performing a ballet routine . During the audition , Connelly , who had no ballet training , tried to imitate a ballerina . Her performance , and the similarity of her nose to Elizabeth McGovern 's , who played the character as an adult , convinced the director to cast her . Connelly described the movie as \" an incredibly idyllic introduction to movie-making \" . While Once Upon a Time in America was being filmed , Connelly made her first television appearance , in the episode \" Stranger in Town \" of the British series Tales of the Unexpected . Her first leading role was in Italian giallo-director Dario Argento 's 1985 film Phenomena , as a girl who uses her psychic powers to communicate with insects , in order to pursue the serial killer of students of the Swiss school where she has just enrolled . She next had the lead in the coming-of-age movie Seven Minutes in Heaven , released the same year . Of her early career , she said , \" Before I knew it , [ acting ] became what I did . It was a very peculiar way to grow up , combined with my personality . \" She described feeling like \" a kind of walking puppet \" through her adolescence , without having time alone to deal with the attention her career was generating . = = = 1980s \u2013 1990s = = = Connelly gained public recognition with Jim Henson 's 1986 film Labyrinth with David Bowie , in which she played Sarah , a teenager on a quest to rescue her brother Toby from the world of goblins . Although a disappointment at the box office , the film later became a cult classic . The New York Times , while noting the importance of her part , panned her portrayal : \" Jennifer Connelly as Sarah is unfortunately disappointing . ... She looks right , but she lacks conviction and seems to be reading rehearsed lines that are recited without belief in her goal or real need to accomplish it . \" Two years later , she starred as a ballet student in the Italian film \u00c9toile , and portrayed college student Gabby in Michael Hoffman 's Some Girls . Balancing work and school , she studied English for two years at Yale University in 1988 and 1989 , before transferring to Stanford University in 1990 to study drama . There , she trained with Roy London , Howard Fine and Harold Guskin . Encouraged by her parents to continue with her film career , Connelly left college and returned to the movie industry the same year . In 1990 , Dennis Hopper directed The Hot Spot , in which Connelly played Gloria Harper , a woman being blackmailed . The film was a box office failure but Connelly was praised . Stephen Schaefer wrote for USA Today , \" Anyone looking for proof that little girls do grow up fast in the movies should take a gander at curvaceous Jennifer Connelly [ ... ] in The Hot Spot . Not yet 20 , Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue \" . During an interview with Shaeffer , Connelly commented on her first nude scene : \" The nudity was hard for me and something I thought about ... but it 's not in a sleazy context \" . The same year , director Garry Marshall considered her for the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman , but ultimately felt that she was too young for the part . Connelly 's next film was the 1991 romantic comedy Career Opportunities , starring alongside Frank Whaley . People magazine criticized the film for exploiting Connelly 's body . The marketing included a life-size cardboard cutout showing Whaley watching Connelly ride a mechanical horse , with the caption \" He 's about to have the ride of his life \" . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Connelly said that a Yale professor brought it to her attention and \" ... that wasn 't something I felt all that comfortable about \" . The big-budget Disney film The Rocketeer ( 1991 ) followed later that year , but failed to ignite her career . She played Jenny Blake , the aspiring actress girlfriend of stunt pilot Cliff , \" the Rocketeer \" . New York characterized the movie as \" pallid \" . The review said of her performance , \" Connelly is properly cast ; she has the moist , full-to-the-cheek bones sensuality of the Hollywood starlets of that period , but she 's a little straight \" . She appeared alongside Jason Priestley in the Roy Orbison music video for \" I Drove All Night \" the following year . Connelly next appeared in Of Love and Shadows , a 1994 Argentine-American drama film written and directed by Betty Kaplan starring Antonio Banderas . In 1995 , director John Singleton cast Connelly as a lesbian college student in Higher Learning . She next appeared in the 1996 independent film Far Harbor as Elie , a prominent person in a Hollywood studio who writes a screenplay based on her traumas . It was followed that year by the neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls , which featured the murder of Allison Pond ( Connelly ) , mistress of General Timms ( John Malkovich ) , and the investigation by a group of detectives led by Maxwell Hoover ( Nick Nolte ) . New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond : \" This footage is actually dirty . That is , it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it , but it 's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away \" . About nudity in the movie , Connelly said : \" It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie , because I had always been so careful about nudity , it was very much a part of this character and I couldn 't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn 't work . It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on , I guess \" . She began to appear in small-budget films which did well with critics , such as 1997 's drama Inventing the Abbotts , set in the late 1950s , in which she played the part of Eleanor , one of three daughters of the town millionaire , Lloyd Abbott . About her performance , director Ron Howard said , \" She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity . She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty , and I guess I stored that information in the back of my brain \" . Her next appearance was in the critically acclaimed 1998 science fiction film Dark City , where she played alongside Rufus Sewell , William Hurt , Ian Richardson and Kiefer Sutherland . Connelly portrayed femme fatale Emma , a torch singer whose husband , John Murdoch ( Rufus Sewell ) , suffers from amnesia . As Murdoch is regaining his memories , Emma is kidnapped by Mr. Hand ( Richard O 'Brien ) and The Strangers , who alter her memories and assign her a new identity . Author Sean McMullen wrote , \" Jennifer Connelly is visually splendid as the 1940s femme fatale ( Emma ) . \" The animated drawing of Aladdin was modelled after Tom Cruise and Jasmine was based on Connelly . = = = Early 2000s = = = In 2001 , Ed Harris directed Connelly in the biopic Pollock in which she played Ruth Kligman , Jackson Pollock 's mistress . In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film , Requiem for a Dream , directed by Darren Aronofsky and based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby , Jr . Connelly played Marion Silver , the girlfriend of Harry , played by Jared Leto ; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn . Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop . She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution . Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived . During her time in the apartment , Connelly isolated herself , painted , listened to music that she considered that her character would , designed clothes , and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin . Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery . Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors ' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation . Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives . The critic Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times , \" Ms. Connelly , too , whittled herself down to a new weight class , and it 's her performance that gives the movie weight , since her fall is the most precipitous . By the end , when she curls into a happy fetal ball with a furtive smile on her face , she has come to love her debasement .... Her dank realization is more disturbing than anything in the novel , and Ms. Connelly has never before done anything to prepare us for how good she is here . \" During 2000 , she appeared as Catherine Miller in the FOX drama series The $ treet , about a brokerage house in New York . Also in 2000 , she appeared in Waking the Dead , a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name , playing Sarah Williams , an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees ( Strangely , Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly 's character in Labyrinth ) . Initially , director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress . Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly 's performance in Far Harbor . Gordon later said : \" There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for . \" About her role , Connelly said , \" Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing . I was really trying to make something of the part and threw myself into it , so that meant a lot to me \" . The New York Times described her performance , \" As Sarah , Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period . And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor . \" The script of Ron Howard 's 2001 film A Beautiful Mind , loosely based on Sylvia Nasar 's 1998 biography of the mathematician John Nash , sparked her interest in the project . Connelly was invited to an audition after her agent Risa Shapiro sent the producers a tape with a clip of the yet unreleased Requiem for a Dream . She was cast by the film 's producer , Brian Grazer , as Alicia Nash , the caring and enduring wife of the brilliant , schizophrenic mathematician , played by Russell Crowe . Howard and the producers eventually chose them after being particularly impressed by their screen chemistry . The film was a critical and commercial success , grossing more than US $ 313 million worldwide . Connelly had the chance to meet the real Alicia Nash before starting shooting and learned more about her life . For her portrayal , Connelly earned a Golden Globe , an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress , and a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Supporting Role . Time magazine critic Richard Schickel called her performance \" luminous \" and the actress intelligent and passionate . Roger Ebert wrote , \" ... Jennifer Connelly is luminous as Alicia . Although the showier performance belongs to Crowe , it is Connelly 's complex work , depicting a woman torn by love for and fear of the same man , that elevates the film to a higher level \" . Connelly said afterward , \" [ A Beautiful Mind ] is the film I 'm really proud of and really love . \" A.O. Scott of The New York Times said , \" There is , for one thing , Ms. Connelly , keen and spirited in the underwritten role of a woman who starts out as a math groupie and soon finds herself the helpmeet of a disturbed , difficult man . \" In relation to previous roles , Connelly said : \" There was a period where I felt like I wasn 't quite being considered for the projects that I wanted to work on because maybe people were thinking . ' I 'm not going to cast the girl who was in that movie for this adult project . ' I 've felt for a long time that this is what I want to do so I 'm happy at this point to just take my time and work on projects that I feel really strongly about and the rest of the time just live my life . \" Connelly said that she became interested in Ang Lee 's Hulk ( 2003 ) because of his philosophical perspective on the Marvel Comics superhero . She played Betty Ross , a scientist and the former girlfriend of the main character , Bruce Banner . The film was a moderate success . It was followed the same year by House of Sand and Fog , a drama based on the novel by Andre Dubus III . She portrayed Kathy Nicolo , an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani ( Ben Kingsley ) . After reading the script , Connelly said : \" ( the story is ) moving and beautifully written . I liked the fact that there is no good guy and bad guy . I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable , because life is often like that . \" Producer Michael London said about Connelly 's portrayal : \" I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had . I don 't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace . \" The film received worldwide critical acclaim , with a BBC reporter commenting , \" [ Connelly ] convinces totally as a selfish , desperate and lonely woman who confesses to her brother , ' I just feel lost ' \" . = = = 2005 \u2013 present = = = After a two-year absence from the film scene , Connelly returned in the 2005 horror \/ psychological thriller Dark Water , which was based on a 2002 Japanese film of the same name . She played Dahlia , a frightened young woman traumatized by her past , who moves with her daughter to an apartment in New York City where paranormal happenings take place . In his review , critic Roger Ebert wrote , \" I cared about the Jennifer Connelly character ; she is not a horror heroine but an actress playing a mother faced with horror . There is a difference , and because of that difference , Dark Water works \" . She played Kathy Adamson in an adaptation of the novel Little Children alongside Kate Winslet , a movie which focuses on the relationship between Sarah Pierce ( played by Winslet ) and Brad Adamson ( Patrick Wilson ) . Connelly co-starred in Blood Diamond opposite Leonardo DiCaprio where she portrayed journalist Maddy Bowen , who is working on exposing the real story behind blood diamonds . New York praised her performance : \" Connelly is such a smart , sane , unhistrionic actress that she almost disguises the fact that her character is a wheeze . \" Both Little Children and Blood Diamond were nominated for multiple Academy Awards . Her next appearance was as Grace in the drama Reservation Road with Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo , a film released in 2007 . After her son dies in a hit-and-run , Grace gradually tries to overcome her grief , while her husband Ethan ( Joaquin Phoenix ) becomes obsessed with discovering who killed him . By her own account , the character she played in the movie proved tougher than any of her previous roles . USA Today 's Susan Wloszczyna commented , \" The strong performances of Jennifer Connelly and Mark Ruffalo ... raise the film above overheated melodrama \" . Parisian fashion house Balenciaga and Revlon cosmetics signed Connelly as the face of their 2008 campaigns . Connelly portrayed astrobiologist Helen Benson alongside Keanu Reeves in the 2008 remake of the 1951 science fiction film The Day The Earth Stood Still . Unlike the original movie , in which Benson was a secretary and her relationship with Klaatu was the focus , the remake featured Benson in a troubled relationship with her stepson , portrayed by Jaden Smith . This was followed by a role in the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That Into You , which also featured Jennifer Aniston and Ginnifer Goodwin . The film was based on the self-help book of the same name . Variety praised her portrayal : \" Despite its layer of darkness Connelly gives a really rich performance as a woman whose principles back her into a corner \" . In 2009 , she appeared in the costume drama biopic Creation , in which she played Emma Darwin , wife of Charles Darwin , opposite her real-life husband Paul Bettany . Set during the writing of On the Origin of Species , the movie depicts Darwin 's struggle with the subject of the book as well as with his wife , who opposed his theories , and their mourning for their daughter Annie . The San Francisco Chronicle wrote , \" Darwin 's wife , a religious woman who disapproved of her husband 's theories , is played by Jennifer Connelly , Bettany 's real-life wife , in the kind of casting that doesn 't always work , but it does here . We believe in the Darwins ' history together , their familiarity and affection . Connelly 's English accent is also as good as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger 's and Gwyneth Paltrow 's . She doesn 't get just the sounds right , but also the music and the attitude \" . She then voiced the character named \" 7 \" , an adventurous warrior in the animated film 9 . Dustin Lance Black 's Virginia premiered on September 15 , 2010 , at the Toronto International Film Festival . Two years later , it was announced that the movie would receive a limited theatrical release in May 2012 . Connelly portrayed the title role of Virginia , a mentally unstable woman who has a 20-year affair with the local sheriff , whose daughter then starts a relationship with Virginia 's son . Connelly prepared for the role by watching documentaries on schizophrenia . She also spent time at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the New York University 's Cancer Center to understand the afflections and obstacles of her character . While she was preparing for the role , director Dustin Lance Black requested Connelly 's advice to design the set of Virginia 's house , as well as the selection of the apparel to create the character 's style . She described the film as a \" very different \" and \" very personal \" independent film . According to Cinema Blend , \" Virginia is propped up by a strong central performance , with Connelly doing some of her best work in years \" . In 2011 , Connelly starred in Ron Howard 's comedy The Dilemma with Vince Vaughn . Although the Austin Chronicle 's review noted , \" Vaughn nails it , and his nicely nuanced everyguy performance is aided by the always-excellent Connelly , \" the movie opened to generally negative reviews .

It lies to the north of the village of Kewstoke , and the stretch of coastline called Sand Bay north of the town of Weston-super-Mare . On a clear day it commands views over Flat Holm , of the Bristol Channel , South Wales , Clevedon , the Second Severn Crossing and the Severn Bridge . A line drawn between Sand Point and Lavernock Point in South Wales marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel . Middle Hope is a sequence of carboniferous limestone with unusual geological features including a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and as a result has been designated as a regionally important geological site . The underlying geology and soil types support scarce plants such as the smallflower buttercup , honewort , Cheddar pink and Somerset hair grass . Human use of the sites is shown by a bowl barrow and disc barrow from late Neolithic or Bronze Age and the site of a likely motte-and-bailey castle . Woodspring Priory , a former Augustinian priory which was founded in the early 13th century , sits just inland of the rocky promontory . The priory and surrounding land is owned by the National Trust and is a popular place for walking . = = Geology = = At Middle Hope a sequence of carboniferous limestone is exposed , which includes thick volcanic tuffs and lavas , demonstrating Tournaisian carbonate sections . The site contains a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and shore platform . These features have led to the designation of Middle Hope as a regionally important geological site ( RIGS ) . The raised beach of wave-cut platforms has been created by changes in sea level of the Bristol Channel since the Quaternary period . The arrangement of volcanic and sedimentary rocks , including the Black Rock Limestone , illustrates the events of 350 million years ago . The strata have been tilted and compressed during the variscan orogeny . = = Flora = = Among scarce plants found on Sand Point are smallflower buttercup , and honewort . The range of soils at the site support various flora and fauna . The calcareous grassland is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata , while the scrub towards the west of the site is dominated by hawthorn ( Crataegus monogyna ) and blackthorn ( Prunus spinosa ) , while that to the east consists of common gorse ( Ulex europaeus ) and bramble ( Rubus fruticosus agg ) . Less common plants include the cheddar pink ( Dianthus gratianopolitanus ) and Somerset hair grass ( Koeleria vallesiana ) . = = History = = Evidence of early human occupation if provided by a bowl barrow and disc barrow from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age have been identified on the higher ground . The bowl barrow is 10 metres ( 33 ft ) in diameter and approximately 0.5 metres ( 1 ft 8 in ) high . Slightly west of the bowl barrow is a disc barrow surrounded by a bank and ditch which enclose an area about 8 metres ( 26 ft ) across . These are situated at the highest point where the Ordnance Survey have constructed a triangulation station . A motte-and-bailey castle may have been constructed after the Norman Conquest . The site is known as Castle Mound or Castle Batch and can be seen as a 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) high mound which is approximately 30 metres ( 98 ft ) in diameter and marked by a ditch on the landward eastern edge . The mound was damaged by the construction of a building during World War II . The medieval date for the construction is in doubt with some sources suggesting that the mound may have been a watchtower constructed in the 16th century . The walls of the sheep fold were built by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars . Hope Cove on the northern coast had a reputation for smuggling as it was \" well away from the men of HM Customs and Excise \" . Woodspring Priory was an Augustinian priory . It was founded by William de Courtney , in the early 13th century , and dedicated to Thomas Becket . The small community built a church and monastic lodgings during the next hundred years . They were Victorine Canons who were influenced by the Cistercians emphasis on manual labour and self-sufficiency . As a result , the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm , as well as providing clergy for surrounding churches . Despite endowments of land the priory was not wealthy until the 15th century when further building work , including the current priory church , infirmary and barn was undertaken . It was dissolved in 1536 and then owned by local noblemen and leased to local farmers . In 1969 the priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust who spent 20 years on restoration work , and since the 1990s have rented out the farmhouse as holiday accommodation . The surviving buildings include the priory church , which was a 15th-century replacement for the earlier 13th century structure , infirmary , barn and 16th century prior 's lodging which was converted into a farmhouse . The whole site was arranged around a central cloister from which only the east wall and west wall of the chapter house remain , the sacristy , refectory , chapter house , lady chapel and parlour having been demolished . Because of the biological and geological interest the site was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1952 . In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune . During World War II weapons were tested at Sand Point , in association with the base at Birnbeck Pier which was commissioned as \" HMS Birnbeck \" by the Admiralty as part of the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development ( DMWD ) for research into new weapons . To support this buildings were constructed at St Thomas Head , east of Middle Hope . Some of these have since been removed and the site is now used by QinetiQ as an explosives and shock test facility .",
