Lion was one of several ships sent into the Western Mediterranean by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent , commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet based at the Tagus in Portugal during the late spring of 1798 . The Spanish squadron was a raiding force that had sailed from Cartagena in Murcia seven days earlier , and was intercepted while returning to its base after an unsuccessful cruise . Although together the Spanish vessels outweighed the British ship , individually they were weaker and Commodore O 'Neil failed to ensure that his manoeuvrees were co-ordinated .

On 5 May 1794 , the British escorts of a convoy from Cork sighted two French ships approaching and gave chase .

Typically measuring 1.2 – 1.5 m ( 3.9 – 4.9 ft ) long , this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back , from which it derives its common name . Large schools of leopard sharks are a common sight in bays and estuaries , swimming over sandy or muddy flats or rock-strewn areas near kelp beds and reefs . They are most common near the coast , in water less than 4 m ( 13 ft ) deep . Active-swimming predators , groups of leopard sharks often follow the tide onto intertidal mudflats to forage for food , mainly clams , spoon worms , crabs , shrimp , bony fish , and fish eggs . Most leopard sharks tend to remain within a particular area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere ,   \n",

The breed was championed by rancher Mike Ruby , who founded the Colorado Ranger Horse Association in 1935 . Original registry membership limits resulted in many Colorado Ranger horses being registered instead as Appaloosas , but pedigree research is ongoing to discover additional horses who trace their ancestry back to the original stallions .

Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus . For example , the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object 's velocity : this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time is advanced . The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value , when it exists , is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point . The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value . For this reason , the derivative is often described as the \" instantaneous rate of change \" , the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable . Derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables .</td>\n",

The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements , called axioms , listed below . Euclidean vectors are an example of a vector space .

It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac . From a purely mathematical viewpoint , the Dirac delta is not strictly a function , because any extended-real function that is equal to zero everywhere but a single point must have total integral zero .

Provided that they are the same size ( have the same number of rows and the same number of columns ) , two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element . The rule for matrix multiplication , however , is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second . Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field .

       "5  Hilbert space = The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space , named after David Hilbert , generalizes the notion of Euclidean space . It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions . A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured . Furthermore , Hilbert spaces are complete : there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used . Hilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in mathematics and physics , typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces . The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied from this point of view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert , Erhard Schmidt , and Frigyes Riesz . They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations , quantum mechanics , Fourier analysis ( which inc   \n",

Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis , largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure .

Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement , although others contest this term , believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon . As a form of Western esotericism , the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions , in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century .

       "5  Derivative = The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of a quantity ( a function value or dependent variable ) which is determined by another quantity ( the independent variable ) . Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus . For example , the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object 's velocity : this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time is advanced . The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value , when it exists , is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point . The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value . For this reason , the derivative is often described as the \" instantaneous rate of change \" , the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable . Derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables .    \n",

       "5  Dirac delta function = In mathematics , the Dirac delta function , or δ function , is a generalized function , or distribution , on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero , with an integral of one over the entire real line . The delta function is sometimes thought of as a hypothetical function whose graph is an infinitely high , infinitely thin spike at the origin , with total area one under the spike , and physically represents the density of an idealized point mass or point charge . It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac . From a purely mathematical viewpoint , the Dirac delta is not strictly a function , because any extended-real function that is equal to zero everywhere but a single point must have total integral zero . The delta function only makes sense as a mathematical object when it appears inside an integral . From this perspective the Dirac delta can usually be manipulated as though it were a function . The formal rules obeyed by this \" fu   \n",

The rule for matrix multiplication , however , is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second . Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field .

The theme of caudillismo — the régime of a charismatic caudillo , a political strongman — is addressed by examining the relationships between power , dictatorship , and writing . Moreover , a dictator novel often is an allegory for the role of the writer in a Latin American society . Although mostly associated with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s , the dictator-novel genre has its roots in the nineteenth-century novel Facundo ( 1845 ) , by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento . As an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas 's dictatorial régime in Argentina , Facundo is the forerunner of the dictator novel genre ; all subsequent dictator novels hearken back to it .

These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons . The opposite of LTP is long-term depression , which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength . It is one of several phenomena underlying synaptic plasticity , the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength . As memories are thought to be encoded by modification of synaptic strength , LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory . LTP was discovered in the rabbit hippocampus by Terje Lømo in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since .
