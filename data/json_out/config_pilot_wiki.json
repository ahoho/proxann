                    "text": "Air ( visual novel ) = Air is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key released on September 8 , 2000 for Windows PCs . Key later released versions of Air without the erotic content , and the game was ported to the Dreamcast , PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable . The story follows the life of Yukito Kunisaki , a traveling showman searching for the \" girl in the sky \" . He arrives in a quiet , seaside town where he meets three girls , one of whom is the key to the end of his journey . The gameplay in Air follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction , and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters by the player character . The game is divided into three segments \u2014 Dream , Summer , and Air \u2014 which serve as different phases in the overall story . The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air , skies , and use of wings throughout gameplay . The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release , and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards . Air has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms . Following the game 's release , Air made several transitions into other media . A manga by Yukimaru Katsura was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten 's Comptiq , and later published into two volumes . Comic anthologies and art books were also published , as were audio dramas and several albums of music . Kyoto Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series and a two-episode anime mini-series in 2005 , and Toei Animation produced an anime film in 2005 . The anime adaptations are licensed by Funimation who released them in North America . = = Gameplay = = Air is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of three characters . Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story 's narrative and dialogue . Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings , and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game , the plot will progress in a specific direction . With the consumer ports , if an undesired choice was selected , there would be an option to rewind the story to correct the mistake . However , if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline , the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point . There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience , three which are initially available and two more which can later become available . Throughout gameplay , the player is given multiple options to choose from , and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made . To view all plot lines in their entirety , the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction . When first playing the game , the player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki and the scenarios for the three heroines are available in what is called the Dream story arc . After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed , an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of Ry\u016bya . Summer is a linear novel arc in which no choices are presented to the player . Upon the completion of the Summer route , another scenario called Air is made available , which serves as the true ending to the story . In Air , the player assumes the role of a crow named Sora . In the adult versions of the game , there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex . Later , Key released versions of Air without the erotic content . = = Plot = = = = = Setting and themes = = = There are important locations featured in Air that are based on places in the city Kami in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture , Japan . Air is set in the Kasumi district of Kami ; during the course of the series ' creation , Kasumi was an individual town that has since merged with two others to form the city of Kami . Many of the locales in Air , such as the seawall , the train station , the shrine , and the school are based on real places . As Air is set in the middle of summer , the season offers bright , sunny skies for the town during the day . In the manga adaptation , the town is described as a \" quiet town with few people ... with nothing but beaches and countryside . \" Scenario assistant Y\u016bichi Suzumoto has commented that his impression of Air is similar to that of a folk song due to the rural setting and heartwarming story progression . As indicated by the title , air , skies and wings are important themes : Yukito is searching for the \" girl in the sky \" , and Misuzu believes her other self is flying in the sky above her . Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky , such as Minagi who is a member of the astronomy club , and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air . Kano wants wings to fly , and Kanna already has them . Misuzu names a crow she finds Sora ( \u7a7a ) \u2014 Japanese for sky . Another major theme is the maternal bond , as the four heroines ' stories , as well as Yukito 's , revolve around their mothers , either biological or adoptive . Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only include a mother and father , as is what happened with Air , though he backs this up by noting that in bish\u014djo games , women are the main focus anyway . Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story . One of the sub-themes in the story is magic . Uraha , Yukito 's mother , and Yukito himself have the ability to use magic , though Yukito is the least skilled among them . Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon , she will gain the power to do magic . However , the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically . = = = Main characters = = = The player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki , the protagonist of Air . He lives a poor life going from town to town with little money , trying to make a living off his show with a puppet . By being an adolescent or young adult , Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked . Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time , and does his best to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc . Misuzu Kamio , the main heroine of Air , makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly , but eventually earns his affection . She is a cheerful but introverted , slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl , and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase gao when she feels troubled , a habit she retained from childhood . Misuzu has a great love of dinosaurs , finding the story of their glory and extinction \" romantic \" . The second of the three heroines Yukito meets after Misuzu is Kano Kirishima , a girl attending the same school as Misuzu . She is usually energetic , playful , and tells jokes by saying nonsensical things . Kano is friends with a strange stray dog named Potato that follows her around and is able to communicate in his strange manner of speech . Kano still believes in things she was told by her older sister Hijiri as a child as a way of coping with her past . The third and final heroine Yukito meets is a girl in Misuzu 's class at school named Minagi Tohno , a top student in the school who is introverted as well . Until she met Yukito , her only friend was Michiru , with whom she often blows bubbles at the abandoned train station in town . = = = Story = = = Air 's story revolves around three girls whose lives are connected to the same man . In the first story arc , Dream , Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan , continuing his late mother 's search for the \" girl in the sky \" . The story opens on Monday July 17 , 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place . On his first day in town , Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by . Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children 's favor , and the children leave without paying him for his performance . That night , Yukito sleeps on the town 's seawall by the beach . Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman 's guild ; after he awakens , they feed him , and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving . As he sits on the town 's seawall eating one of the rice balls , he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio \u2014 a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him . Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him , while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts . He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat . After Haruko , Misuzu 's aunt and foster mother , is persuaded , it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being . The next day , Yukito meets a girl named Kano Kirishima and a stray dog named Potato ; Kano and Misuzu go to the same high school . Later that day , Yukito meets a third girl named Minagi Tohno , Misuzu 's classmate , and her friend Michiru . Like Misuzu , both Kano and Minagi have strange personalities connected with mysterious pasts . Before long , a legend of \" one thousand summers \" begins to unfold where the mysteries of the past are framed primarily by the relationship between Yukito and Misuzu . The cursed \" girl in the sky \" Yukito has been searching for turns out to be Misuzu . By the time he figures this out , she has already grown to love him and has passed her 15th birthday . Once these things have come to pass , the \" girl in the sky \" is cursed to die . The remainder of this arc is dedicated to Yukito 's attempt to save her , trying to effectively break the curse . The next arc , Summer , reveals events that occurred in the summer of one thousand years before the Dream arc , taking place in the Heian period . Kannabi no mikoto , or Kanna , is one of the last winged beings in Air 's fictional setting and is held as a prisoner in her own castle . Since she bears wings on her back , she is not permitted to leave the castle walls or see her mother , who is in a similar situation elsewhere . With Ry\u016bya , a member of her samurai guard , and Uraha , a fledgling telekinetic , Kanna escapes and traverses feudal Japan to find her mother . However , the rest of the guard and a sect of Buddhist monks follow them . After catching up , they place a curse on Kanna where she must endure constant reincarnation and death whenever she finds love ; Misuzu is one such reincarnation . In the last arc , Air , Yukito 's final wish to save Misuzu 's life is heard . The story starts over from the Dream arc , although it is seen through the view point of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora . New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc . After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home , her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is . Misuzu 's father Keisuke Tachibana shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home , but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time , and they agree on extending the time for three more days . After the three days pass , Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko ; he decides to let them stay together . The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter , culminating in Misuzu 's death . = = Development = = After the completion of Kanon , the Key staff started production on Air and expanded the number of people involved in this project compared to Kanon . The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt 's , the publishing company that Key is under . The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers , the other being Takashi Ishikawa . Scenario assistance was provided by four more people : Kazuki Fujii , Kai , T\u014dya Okano , and Y\u016bichi Suzumoto . Art direction was headed by Key 's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design . Further computer graphics were split between three people \u2014 Miracle Mikipon , Na-Ga , and Shinory \u2014 and background art was provided by Din and Torino . The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito , Jun Maeda , and Magome Togoshi , who had started working with Key since before Kanon 's release . After the completion of Air , two of the staff \u2014 Kazuki Fujii , and Takashi Ishikawa \u2014 left Key . Jun Maeda , the main scenario writer of Air , commented that in the early stages of Air 's production , it was already decided that it was to be an adult game , and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content , that it would not have been as commercially successful . Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bish\u014djo games do , including Kanon . While attempting to do this , Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games . As such , while the game incorporates stories from several characters , they are all of varying lengths . = = = Release history = = = Air was released as an adult game on September 8 , 2000 as a limited edition , playable on a Windows PC as a 2-disc CD-ROM set . The limited edition came bundled with the remix album Ornithopter remixing background music tracks featured in the visual novel . The regular edition was released on July 27 , 2001 .

Prototype later released a VGA edition produced by NTT DoCoMo playable on FOMA phones in February 2008 .

The individual chapters were later collected into two separate volumes published by Kadokawa Shoten . The story was adapted from the visual novel version that preceded it , and was illustrated by Japanese artist Yukimaru Katsura . Between the two volumes , there are 15 main chapters ( nine in volume one and six in volume two ) , and two bonus chapters included at the end of each volume . The manga version goes through the Dream and Air arcs in detail while the Summer arc is only touched upon briefly throughout the manga . The main focus is on Misuzu 's story with Kano and Minagi serving as minor characters in comparison . However , Minagi 's story is explained in the bonus installment at the end of volume two . There are also five sets of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists . The first volume of the earliest anthology series , released by Ichijinsha under the title Air Comic Anthology , was released on January 25 , 2001 under their DNA Media Comics label . Volumes for this series continued to be released until December 25 , 2001 with the seventh volume .

The first three focused solely on each of the main heroines separately per CD where the cover of the album would depict which of the girls to be presented . These three albums were released on August 24 , 2005 . The next set of three was done the same way and released on October 21 , 2005 . The last three were released in one month increments after the second batch of three drama CDs went on sale . The seventh CD focused on the events of the Summer arc in the story while the last two were based on the Air arc . At least the last CD released on January 25 , 2006 contained original stories in addition to the story from the visual novel . = = = Anime = = = On November 17 , 2004 , a teaser DVD named \" Air prelude \" was produced containing interviews with the anime 's cast , clean opening and ending theme video sequences , and promotional footage of the anime itself ; it was a limited edition DVD , with only 20,000 copies produced . The anime television series is produced by Kyoto Animation , directed by Tatsuya Ishihara , written by Fumihiko Shimo , and features character design by Tomoe Aratani who based the designs on Itaru Hinoue 's original concept . Thirteen episodes were produced by Kyoto Animation : 12 regular episodes , and a final recap episode which summarizes Misuzu 's story arc . The anime also follows the game by splitting the series into three parts ; Dream ( episodes one through seven ) , Summer ( episodes eight and nine ) , and Air ( episodes 10 through 12 ) , with the recap episode ( episode 13 ) following . The episodes aired between January 6 and March 31 , 2005 on the BS-i Japanese television network .

The game ranked twice at 42 in November and December 2000 , at 20 in January 2001 , and twice more at 42 through February 2001 . The original release appeared on the charts twice more : the first in late September to early October 2001 at 26 , and again in the last two weeks of May 2002 , ranking in at 43 . The regular edition of the Air PC release premiered at number 13 , ranked in at number 41 in the following ranking , and 42 in the ranking after that . The PC all ages version premiered at number seven in the rankings and had a final ranking at 30 in the next ranking . The Air Standard Edition premiered at number one in the rankings . The Air Standard Edition ranked in twice more , at 34 and at 28 in the next two rankings . Air was the highest selling game of 2000 selling 102,080 units , which was about 25,000 more units than the second highest game , Inagawa de Ik\u014d ! . The Dreamcast version sold 42,445 units in its first week , and was the fourth highest selling console game in Japan that week . The video game magazine Famitsu scored this version a 30 out of 40 , and it ultimately sold 50,406 units to rank as the 53rd highest selling Japanese Dreamcast game ever , as of 2007 . NTT Publishing reported that over 300,000 units of Air have been sold . \" Air took the bish\u014djo gaming world by storm , \" as states a review of the Dreamcast game by MobyGames . Air was described as a game that stands out , much like Key 's first title Kanon , due to an intricate plot that keeps the player interested , and has a good replay value as well . In an interview of Jun Maeda and Y\u016bichi Suzumoto , they were both surprised to find out that the Japanese public ( in March 2001 ) felt Air to be a soothing game , but Maeda and Suzumoto made it clear that this impression is completely at odds with their impression of the game , and they remark that there was not one person who worked on Air who thought that . Characters from Air have appeared in d\u014djin works not directly based on the Air series . Games such as Eternal Fighter Zero -Blue Sky Edition- by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from Air or from the earlier Key games Kanon or One . In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G 's Magazine , poll results for the 50 best bish\u014djo games were released . Out of 249 titles , Air ranked eighth with 43 votes .",

The manga was originally serialized in Dengeki Daioh between the July 2004 and May 2007 issues , and later published in five bound volumes by MediaWorks from January 2005 to May 2007 . The story focuses on Hazumu Osaragi , a normal , albeit effeminate high school boy who is killed when an alien spaceship crash lands on him , only to be restored to health as a girl . This results in a same-sex love triangle that Hazumu finds herself in with two of her best female friends . A single light novel written by Mako Komao and illustrated by the manga 's artist was published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Bunko imprint in January 2006 . The manga series was adapted into a twelve-episode anime television series plus a single original video animation ( OVA ) sequel by Studio Hibari . The anime aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between January and March 2006 ; the OVA was released in October 2006 . A visual novel was created based on the series for the PlayStation 2 and was released in March 2006 . Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga series for English-language publication in North America and released the five volumes between December 2006 and March 2008 . Media Blasters licensed the anime series , including the OVA , and released three DVD volumes between June and October 2007 with English-subtitles . Media Blasters re-released the anime with an English dub . The manga has been given positive reviews by the popular anime and manga magazine Newtype USA , and at the online resources Anime News Network and IGN . The first manga volume was Newtype USA 's Book of the Month for December 2006 , and Newtype 's noted Seven Seas Entertainment 's \" fan-focused \" translation without an effort to localize the humor for the mainstream American market . In July 2007 , Kashimashi was Seven Seas Entertainment 's best-selling title . The anime has been likened to Rumiko Takahashi 's Ranma \u00bd , though only as far as the mutual transgender themes . Critics of the anime praised the down to earth characters , and the generally great animation quality with its soft and detailed art style . = = Plot = = At the start of Kashimashi , a young high school boy named Hazumu Osaragi declares his love to classmate and close friend Yasuna Kamiizumi , but she quickly rejects him . Dejected , Hazumu climbs Mt . Kashima and is killed when an alien spacecraft accidentally crash lands on him . To rectify this , the alien in the ship named Hitoshi Sora brings Hazumu back to life , but inadvertently regenerates him as a female right down to the DNA level . This change in Hazumu serves as the catalyst for the development of character interactions for the remainder of the series . After Hazumu returns to school , Yasuna unexpectedly professes her love for Hazumu , but this serves only to confuse Hazumu as she adjusts to her new life as a girl . Yasuna , a rather feminine girl , has a unique affliction which makes her incapable of seeing males , and instead sees males as covered in a gray , hazy blur . Hazumu 's childhood friend Tomari Kurusu , an athletic girl and tomboy , finds Hazumu 's change difficult to cope with . Tomari starts to realize her own romantic feelings for Hazumu as Yasuna starts becoming closer to Hazumu , especially after Tomari witnesses Hazumu and Yasuna kissing one day after school . A conflict arises between Yasuna and Tomari who fight for Hazumu 's affection while she is unable to choose between them . This results in a love triangle emerging between the three female main characters . Hazumu 's best male friend Asuta Soro also starts having romantic feelings for Hazumu , but tries his best to repress them . Tomari 's good friend Ayuki Mari , an intelligent girl interested in the sciences , continuously observes the ongoing development of the love triangle while keeping a stance of watching from afar . The very stoic Hitoshi originally came to Earth in order to study human emotions , especially those related to love , in an attempt to save his species from extinction . His species has long-since given up their emotions resulting in a loss of their sexual urges and thus a continuously dwindling population . Hitoshi moves into Hazumu 's home where he is warmly welcomed by Hazumu 's parents . He brings with him an artificially intelligent gynoid named Jan Pu which serves as the automatic pilot for his spaceship . Jan Pu 's body is modeled after Hazumu 's own female body , and possesses an energetic and childish personality . While initially citing Hazumu 's change as an accident , Hitoshi later realizes this was an unexpected result of the regeneration process . By the time Hitoshi becomes aware of his mistake , he tells Hazumu and her friends she has only one month left to live . Hitoshi explains to Hazumu 's friends how someone very close to Hazumu has to donate \" life grains \" to Hazumu to sustain her life . While unaware her friends know about her impending death , Hazumu continues to live her life and comes to fully accept her fate . The day Hazumu is appointed to die , she falls off the school 's roof and Tomari jumps off the roof in an attempt to save her . While in mid-air , Hitoshi interferes by transferring the necessary \" life grains \" to Hazumu , and both survive the fall . When they later wake up in the infirmary , Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari , effectively choosing her over Yasuna . The anime ends differently , with no life-threatening situation and Hazumu choosing Yasuna in order to help cure her worsening sight problem as it begins to degrade so she can no longer see girls as well . Afterwards however , Yasuna , who becomes able to see all people again , decides to break up with Hazumu , saying she can stand on her own , and in the follow-up original video animation episode , Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari on Christmas and the two get married in a ceremony held by Hitoshi . = = Production = = When it was decided that Kashimashi : Girl Meets Girl would begin serialization in MediaWorks ' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh , Satoru Akahori wondered what kind of a message he could send to the readers , and eventually decided he wanted to write a steady message of \" true love \" . Akahori noted that up to the creation of Kashimashi , the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love , and much of his previous work involved a lot of ecchi content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in Kashimashi . He wondered if the story would be interesting , and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works , if he wrote a true love story without much ecchi or fan service . When thinking on how to write about true love , Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls , it eventually tends towards having sex . In order to avoid this , he chose to have a cast of female main characters , but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough . This is when he thought up the idea of changing the main character from a boy to a girl . Akahori knew this would be a problem , since normally changing a person 's gender would cause complications , one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male . He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided , but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male . For this reason , Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed . To do this , Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female , but to broadcast this over the entire world , which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi . Afterwards , Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien 's role in the story . At this point in the development process , Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story . The title Kashimashi loosely translates as \" noisy , boisterous , or clamorous \" and is derived from the Japanese phrase , \" When three women gather , it is noisy \" ( \u5973\u4e09\u4eba\u5bc4\u308c\u3070\u59e6\u3057\u3044 , Onna sannin yoreba kashimashii ) . The main title was originally romanized as Kasimasi in accordance with Kunrei-shiki romanization , but this was later changed in the English adaptations to Kashimashi in accordance with Hepburn romanization . = = Media = = = = = Manga = = = The Kashimashi manga is written by Satoru Akahori and illustrated by Yukimaru Katsura .

The game was developed by Vridge , published by Marvelous Interactive , and released in two editions , limited and regular , on the same day . The limited edition came in a specially made box with an original drama CD called \" Kashimashi Triangle Letter \" , and a music CD featuring songs from the game in piano arrange versions . The game was later re-released in a Best Collection edition on November 16 , 2006 , which sold at less than half the price of the original game . Kashimashi : Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story received a total review score of 26 / 40 ( out of the four individual review scores of 7 , 6 , 7 , and 6 ) from the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu . The game 's story begins on the outset of summer vacation . Hazumu 's homeroom teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week trip to a small mountain village with a hot spring resort . Hazumu 's grandparents reside in this town , and are two new characters introduced to the story . Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu ; two are the same age as her , and the third is the older landlady of the resort . The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters . The gameplay 's main system comes from Hazumu 's indecisive personality . If the player shows more interest in a particular character , the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them , which is displayed in a tension meter . The more Hazumu ignores a particular character , the higher the tension between that character becomes . This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests . In order to view the ending of a particular character , a certain amount of tension will have to be between the other characters , but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show . The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist . An important aspect of the game ( as in nearly every visual novel ) are the \" decision points \" which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options . The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer . The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes , the plot will progress in a specific direction . Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays . = = Reception = = = = = Manga = = = In July 2007 , the English version of Kashimashi was Seven Seas Entertainment 's best-selling title . The first volume of the manga was given positive reviews from such sources as Newtype USA , a popular anime and manga magazine . The first volume was named as Newtype USA 's Book of the Month for December 2006 , and the review noted Seven Seas Entertainment 's \" fan-focused \" translation , which retained the honorifics and much of the Japanese wordplay without efforts to localize the humor for the mainstream American market . The review goes on to state that \" for fans of more mainstream romantic productions , it 's a neat twist on the traditional love-triangle formula , and a charming alternative to boys meeting girls . \" In a review at Anime News Network ( ANN ) , Carlo Santos commented that \" the fast-moving events of this first volume combine to form a story of many moods : a gender-bending comedy , but with sci-fi touches , and most of all , a romance more touching than one might expect . The time has come to rethink the love triangle . \" In a review at IGN , A. E. Sparrow stated \" there 's plenty to enjoy in the first book , however . Hazumu attempting to buy his first bra is pretty humorous , as are the occasional visits from the aliens who put him in this situation in the first place . \" The second volume of the manga was positively reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin , who wrote : \" With its second volume the title pushes fully into the realm of romantic comedy , liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides , pratfalls , and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu . For all its attempts to be funny , though , it is the story 's more dramatic side that will keep you coming back . \" In ANN 's review of manga volume three , Theron Martin wrote , \" The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary , but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming . The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks [ but ] ... the male characters , though easily distinguishable , stand out less . \" In ANN 's double review of manga volumes four and five , Martin commented , \" these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little yuri series . It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version , and those irritated by the anime 's ending should find this one more to their liking . \" The first manga volume was generally panned by Deb Aoki at About.com where she felt the characters were \" too flat and uninteresting \" , and the story being \" too far-fetched \" and \" ridiculous \" to make a good story . However , Aoki admitted the art is \" quite nice , and there are some moments of genuine tenderness and humor . \" In a review of the first manga volume by Matthew Alexander at Mania.com , he thought that while \" stories with love triangles or gender-switching protagonists have been done before ... Hazumu 's change into a girl explores romance between people of the same sex in an interesting and comedic way . \" = = = Anime = = = The anime series has been compared with a similar series that involved gender swapping \u2014 Rumiko Takahashi 's Ranma \u00bd . In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews , the reviewer wrote , \" [ the anime is ] rather aggravating to watch at times , but seems to have no problem raising smiles whenever it wants to , either . The characters , as they are , bring much of the believability of the show , despite the alien elements . It 's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at , if nothing else . The rather soft and detailed art style does help , of course , as does the generally great animation quality . \" The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman , who is the president of Yuricon , an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga , and ALC Publishing , a publishing house dedicated to yuri . Friedman described the anime 's conclusion as \" so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life ... that it kind of just went under the radar . So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it 's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get [ s ] the girl and ... thud . Nothing . \" The anime was given an overall score of 7 / 10 by Friedman . The three DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network . In the review of the first DVD , the reviewer commented , \" The series ' skillful juggling of different characters ' viewpoints puts the audience in a position to sympathize strongly with each one . Director Nobuaki Nakanishi guides the emotional content with a light , gentle touch \u2014 wisely forgoing extensive internal monologues , speeches , and emotional outbursts . Instead , he draws you in with soft , effortlessly evocative visuals and a simple , beautifully understated score , relying on subtly shifting facial expressions and meaning-laden actions to communicate the quietly affecting emotional states of his characters . \" For the second DVD volume , Theron Martin commented , \" Every element of the production , from the style of the artistry to the palette of colors used to the soundtrack , contributes wonderfully to the look and feel of the original story , and the anime script not only exactly duplicates many scenes from the manga but also does everything in its power to stay true to the spirit of the original writing . \" Finally , for the third volume , Carl Kimlinger wrote \" ... the writers make an ill-advised attempt to remove the \" bitter \" from \" bittersweet \" by tacking on some decidedly unconvincing plot developments [ in the OVA , although ] ... it isn 't as awful as it could have been . The third volume of Kashimashi ... creat [ es ] a deeply satisfying conclusion with all of the vicarious emotional thrills you could possibly want . \" The three DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In the review of the first DVD , the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as \" something different from the norm \" which \" mixes romance and comedy quite well \" . However , the pacing early on is felt as being \" awkward \" which \" takes time to really find its rhythm \" . For the second DVD volume , Beveridge commented that \" the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show . \" Beveridge goes on to state \" the mild moments of it are tacky and bad , \" but \" when it comes to the core cast of characters , it 's all solid material that is very enjoyable . \" Finally , for the third volume , Beveridge wrote that \" despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode , Kashimashi has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented . \" The series is seen to \" close out rather well , \" and \" not only is it good fun but it 's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion . \"",

It was originally serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from 1984 to 1995 , with the 519 individual chapters published into 42 tank\u014dbon volumes by Shueisha . Dragon Ball was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to the West . The series follows the adventures of the protagonist , Goku , from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls , which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered . Along his journey , Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains , many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls . The 42 tank\u014dbon have been adapted into two anime series produced by Toei Animation : Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z , which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996 . Additionally , the studio has developed nineteen animated feature films and three television specials , as well as a third anime series titled Dragon Ball GT . From 2009 to 2015 , a revised , faster-paced version of Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan under the title Dragon Ball Kai , in which most of the original version 's footage not featured in the manga is removed . A fifth anime series titled Dragon Ball Super began airing in Japan on July 5 , 2015 . Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films , both animated and live-action , collectible trading card games , numerous action figures , along with several collections of soundtracks and a large number of video games . The manga series was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Viz Media , in the United Kingdom by Gollancz Manga , and Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment . The entire anime series was licensed by Funimation for an English-language release in the United States , although the series has not always been dubbed by the same studio . There have been many films of the franchise including the first live-action film adaptation being produced in 1989 in Taiwan . In 2002 , 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to produce an American-made live-action film titled Dragonball Evolution that was received negatively by critics and fans ; the movie was released on April 10 , 2009 in the United States . Since its release , Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time . The manga 's 42 volumes have sold over 156 million copies in Japan and more than 230 million copies worldwide , making it the third best-selling manga series in history . Reviewers have praised the art , characterization , and humor of the story . It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made , with many manga artists such as Eiichiro Oda ( One Piece ) , Masashi Kishimoto ( Naruto ) , Tite Kubo ( Bleach ) , Hiro Mashima ( Rave Master , Fairy Tail ) and Kentaro Yabuki ( Black Cat ) citing Dragon Ball as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works . The anime , particularly Dragon Ball Z , is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture . = = Plot summary = = The series begins with a monkey-tailed boy named Goku befriending a teenage girl named Bulma , whom he accompanies to find the seven Dragon Balls ( \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb , Doragon B\u014dru ) , which summon the dragon Shenlong to grant the user one wish . The journey leads them to the desert bandit Yamcha , who later becomes an ally ; Chi-Chi , whom Goku unknowingly agrees to marry ; and Pilaf , an impish man who seeks the Dragon Balls to fulfill his desire to rule the world . Goku then undergoes rigorous training regimes under the martial arts master Kame-Sen 'nin in order to fight in the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai ( \u5929\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b66\u9053\u4f1a , \" Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament \" ) . A monk named Kuririn becomes his training partner and rival , but they soon become best friends . After the tournament , Goku searches for the Dragon Ball his grandfather left him and almost single-handedly defeats the Red Ribbon Army and their hired assassin Taopaipai . Thereafter Goku reunites with his friends to defeat the fortuneteller Baba Uranai 's fighters and have her locate the last Dragon Ball to revive a friend killed by Taopaipai . At the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai three years later Goku and his allies oppose Kame-Sen 'nin 's rival and Taopaipai 's brother , Tsuru-Sen 'nin , and his students Tenshinhan and Chaozu . Kuririn is killed after the tournament and Goku tracks down and is defeated by his killer , Piccolo Daimao . The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin , where he receives healing and a power boost . Meanwhile , Piccolo fights Kame-Sen 'nin and Chaozu , leading to both their deaths , and uses the Dragon Balls to regain his youth before destroying Shenlong . Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao , who , just before dying , spawns his son / reincarnation Piccolo . Karin then directs Goku to Kami-sama , the original creator of the Dragon Balls , to restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends . Goku trains under Kami for the next three years , once again reuniting with his friends at the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai , where he narrowly wins against Piccolo before leaving with Chi-Chi to keep his promise to marry her . Five years later , Goku is a young adult and father to his son Gohan , when Raditz arrives on Earth , identifies Goku as his younger brother ' Kakarrot ' and reveals to him that they are members of a nearly extinct extraterrestrial race called the Saiyans ( \u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba , Saiya-jin ) , who sent Goku to conquer Earth for them , until he suffered a severe head injury and lost all memory of his mission . Goku refuses to continue the mission , sides with Piccolo , and sacrifices his life to defeat Raditz . In the afterlife Goku trains under the North Kai\u014d until he is revived by the Dragon Balls to save the Earth from the invading Nappa and Vegeta . In the battle Yamcha , Chaozu , Tenshinhan , and Piccolo are killed , and the Dragon Balls cease to exist . Kuririn and the galactic tyrant Freeza learn of another set of Dragon Balls on planet Namek ( \u30ca\u30e1\u30c3\u30af\u661f , Namekku-sei ) , whereupon Bulma , Gohan , and Kuririn search for them to revive their friends and subsequently the Earth 's Dragon Balls , leading to several battles with Freeza 's minions and Vegeta , the latter standing alongside the heroes to fight the Ginyu Force , a team of mercenaries . The long battle with Freeza himself comes to a close when Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan ( \u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba , S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin ) of legends and defeats him . A group of Androids ( \u4eba\u9020\u4eba\u9593 , Jinz\u014dningen , \" Artificial Humans \" ) created by a member of the former Red Ribbon Army , Doctor Gero , appear three years later , seeking revenge against Goku . During this time , an evil life form called Cell also emerges and , after absorbing two of the Androids to achieve his \" perfect form , \" holds his own fighting tournament to challenge the protagonists . After Goku sacrifices his own life to no avail , Gohan avenges his father by defeating Cell . Seven years later , Goku , briefly revived for one day , and his allies are drawn into a fight against Majin Boo . After numerous battles , including destruction and re-creation of the Earth , Goku destroys Boo with a Genki-Dama ( a sphere of pure energy drawn from all intelligent beings on Earth ) and wishes for him to be reincarnated as a \" good person . \" Ten years later , at another Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai , Goku meets Boo 's human reincarnation , Oob . Leaving their match unfinished , Goku departs with Oob to train him to be Earth 's new guardian . = = Production = = Akira Toriyama loosely modeled Dragon Ball on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West ; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 one-shot manga Dragon Boy . He has said that the fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan , as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West , but with \" a little kung fu . \" Since it was serialized in a sh\u014dnen magazine , he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something , without thinking of what the characters would wish for . With Goku being Sun Wukong , Bulma as Xuanzang , Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing , he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected . Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand , he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at readers older than those of his previous serial Dr. Slump . He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in Dr. Slump , deliberately going for Chinese scenery , referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought . The island where the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai is held is modeled after Bali , which he , his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985 , and for the area around Bobbidi 's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa . It was when the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai martial arts tournament began that Dragon Ball truly became popular , having recalled the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump . Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments , Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory . He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game Spartan X , in which enemies tended to appear very fast . He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain , and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw . Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth , they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans . Freeza , who forcibly took over planets to resell them , was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators , whom Toriyama called the \" worst kind of people . \" Finding the escalating enemies difficult , he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series . He added time travel next , but said he had a hard time with it , only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo . After Cell 's death , Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series ' protagonist , but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind . Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size , he designed many of Dragon Ball 's most powerful characters with small statures , including the protagonist , Goku . When creating a character , his process is to first come up with their face and body type , and then the clothes while thinking of the world they inhabit and if the fighters can move around in them . Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story , resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series , including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screen tone because he found it difficult to use . Toriyama later explained the he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier , even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically . When including fights in the manga , Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings . While he personally dislikes the idea of naming fighting techniques , Torishima at the time felt it would be better , so Toriyama proceeded to create names for all of the techniques , except for the series ' signature Kamehameha ( \u304b\u3081\u306f\u3081\u6ce2 , lit . \" Kamehame Wave \" ) which his wife came up with when he was indecisive about what it should be called . In order to advance the story quickly by having characters travel without inconvenience , he created the flying cloud Kinto-un ( \u7b4b\u6597\u96f2 , lit . \" Somersault Cloud \" ) , then gave most fighters the flying technique Buk\u016b-jutsu ( \u821e\u7a7a\u8853 , lit . \" Air Dance Technique \" ) , and finally granted Goku the teleportation ability Shunkan Id\u014d ( \u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5 , lit . \" Instant Teleport \" ) . Once he came up with the idea of the Super Saiyan , he felt the only way to show Goku 's massive power up was to have him transform . Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain , but felt since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable . While talking to his long-time friend and fellow manga artist Masakazu Katsura about how there was nothing stronger than a Super Saiyan , Katsura suggested having two characters \" fuse \" together , leading to the creation of the Fusion ( \u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 , Fy\u016bjon ) technique . Since the completion of Dragon Ball , Toriyama has continued to add to its story , mostly background information on its universe , through guidebooks published by Shueisha . During the second half of the series , Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it , and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines . He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become \" too square \" , so he intentionally made it more so . In 2013 , he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed , so he did not draw very elaborate , going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art . He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an \" unconventional and contradictory \" story . In 2013 , commenting on Dragon Ball 's global success , Toriyama said , \" Frankly , I don 't quite understand why it happened . While the manga was being serialized , the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy . \" , \" The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through . I dare say I don 't care even if [ my works ] have left nothing behind , as long as they have entertained their readers . \" = = Media = = = = = Manga = = = Written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama , Dragon Ball was serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from November 20 , 1984 to May 23 , 1995 , when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing . The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 tank\u014dbon volumes by Shueisha from September 10 , 1985 through August 4 , 1995 .

Twenty volumes , beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs , were released between February 4 , 2013 and July 4 , 2014 . The Dragon Ball manga is licensed for release in English in North America by Viz Media . Viz originally released volumes 17 through 42 ( chapters 195 through 519 ) under the title \" Dragon Ball Z \" to mimic the name of the anime series adapted from those volumes , feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers . They initially released both series chapter by chapter in a monthly comic book format starting in 1998 , and later began collecting them in graphic novels in 2000 . In 2000 , while releasing Dragon Ball in the monthly format , Viz began to censor the series in response to complaints by parents . They argued that when there are parental complaints , major chain stores stop selling the series , so to keep wide distribution , they made some \" concessions \" . They assured that all changes were done with approval by Toriyama and Shueisha , with Toriyama making suggestions himself : such as to obscure Goku 's genitals with objects , rather than \" neuter him \" . A fan petition that garnered over 10,000 signatures was created , and a year later , Viz announced they would stop censoring the series and instead increased its \" rating \" to 13 and up , and reprinted the first 3 graphic novels . \" Dragon Ball Z \" , from Trunk 's appearance to chapter 226 , was published in Viz 's monthly magazine Shonen Jump from its debut issue in January 2003 to April 2005 . Later , the first ten collected volumes of both series were re-released from March to May 2003 under their \" Shonen Jump \" imprint , with Dragon Ball being completed on August 3 , 2004 and Dragon Ball Z finishing on June 6 , 2006 . However , when releasing the last few volumes of Dragon Ball Z , the company began to censor the series again ; translating the sound effects of gunshots to \" zap \" and changing the few sexual references . In June 2008 , Viz began re-releasing the two series in a wideban format called \" Viz Big Edition , \" which collects three individual volumes into a single large volume . These editions are on higher quality paper and include some of the original Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump color pages , however , they include new censorship not in the 2003 releases . On November 3 , 2008 , the first volumes of both series were released in hardcover \" Collector 's Editions . \" Viz began releasing new 3-in-1 volumes of Dragon Ball , similar to their \" Viz Big Edition \" , with volume one released on June 4 , 2013 . This version uses the Japanese kanzenban covers and marks the first time in English that the entire series is being released under the Dragon Ball name .

These chapters were compiled into one kanzenban volume for release on April 4 , 2005 . In 2006 , in celebration of the 30th anniversary of Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K\u014den-mae Hashutsujo ( or Kochikame ) , a special manga titled Super Kochikame ( \u8d85\u3053\u3061\u4e80 , Ch\u014d Kochikame ) was released on September 15 .

By 2000 , more than 126 million copies of its tank\u014dbon volumes had been sold in Japan alone . By 2012 , this number had grown to pass 156 million in Japan and 230 million worldwide , making it the second best-selling Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump manga of all time . Dragon Ball is credited as one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s . For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 , Japanese fans voted Dragon Ball the third greatest manga of all time . In a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 among 1,000 people , Son Goku , the main character of the franchise , ranked first place as the \" Strongest Manga Character of All Time . \" Goku 's journey and his ever growing strength resulted in the character winning \" the admiration of young boys everywhere \" . Manga artists , such as One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto , have stated that Goku inspired their series ' main protagonists as well as series structure . Manga critic Jason Thompson stated in 2011 that \" Dragon Ball is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years , and today , almost every Shonen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways . \" He says the series \" turns from a gag / adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga \" , and its basic formula of \" lots of martial arts , lots of training sequences , a few jokes \" became the model for other sh\u014dnen series , such as Naruto . Thompson also called Toriyama 's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series ' popularity . James S. Yadao , author of The Rough Guide to Manga , claims that the first several chapters of Dragon Ball \" play out much like Saiyuki with Dr. Slump-like humour built in \" and that Dr. Slump , Toriyama 's previous manga , has a clear early influence on the series . He feels the series \" established its unique identity \" after the first occasion when Goku 's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen 'nin , when the story develops \" a far more action-packed , sinister tone \" with \" wilder \" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count , while humor still makes an occasional appearance . Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters \" lose the rounded , innocent look that he established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity . \" Animerica felt the series had \" worldwide appeal \" , using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to \" maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience 's attention spans \" . In Little Boy : The Art of Japan 's Exploding Subculture , Takashi Murakami commented that Dragon Ball 's \" never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly , seamlessly , and with great finesse . \" Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a \" chubby \" art style , but as the series continued the characters got more refined , leaner , and more muscular . Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts . Allen Divers of Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters ' personalities . Divers also called Viz 's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese . D. Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as \" a superior humor title \" . They praised Goku 's innocence and Bulma 's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series . The content of the manga has been controversial in United States . In November 1999 , Toys \" R \" Us removed Viz 's Dragon Ball from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had \" borderline soft porn \" after he bought them for his four-year-old son . Commenting on the issue , Susan J. Napier explained it as a difference in culture . After the ban , Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution . However , in 2001 , after releasing three volumes censored , Viz announced Dragon Ball would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions . In October 2009 , Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the Dragon Ball manga from their school district because it \" depicts nudity , sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children . \" = = = Anime = = = The anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga , with Anime News Network saying \" Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way Dragon Ball Z has . To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm , and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom . \" In 2000 , satellite TV channel Animax together with Brutus , a men 's lifestyle magazine , and Tsutaya , Japan 's largest video rental chain , conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series , with Dragon Ball coming in fourth . TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime , Dragon Ball came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll . On several occasions the Dragon Ball anime has topped Japan 's DVD sales . Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up Dragon Ball as \" an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer \u2014 a genuine sense of adventure . \" Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation 's reputation for drastic alterations of the script , but praised the dub . However , some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation 's English dub and script of Dragon Ball Z over the years . Jeffrey Harris IGN criticized the voices including how Freeza 's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza 's gender . Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series ' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development . Despite praising Dragon Ball Z for its cast of characters , they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights . Dragon Ball Z is well-known , and often criticized , for its long , repetitive , dragged-out fights that span several episodes , with Martin commenting \" DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form . \" However , Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga . Dragon Ball Z was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN 's Top 100 Animated Series , and was also listed as the 50th greatest cartoon in Wizard magazine 's Top 100 Greatest Cartoons list . Harris commented that Dragon Ball GT \" is downright repellent \" , mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun . He also criticized the GT character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy . Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about GT , mentioning that the fights from the series were \" a very simple childish exercise \" and that many other anime were superior . The plot of Dragon Ball GT has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors . The first episode of Dragon Ball Z Kai earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11.3 , ahead of One Piece and behind Crayon Shin-chan . Although following episodes had lower ratings , Kai was among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan for most of its run .",

Appearing as a monthly serial in the Japanese manga magazine Bessatsu Hana to Yume from the August 2008 issue to the June 2010 issue , the eighteen chapters of Grand Guignol Orchestra were collected into five bound volumes by Hakusensha \u2014 together with Yuki 's romantic one-shot manga \" Camolet Garden \" , which had appeared in the April 2008 issue \u2014 and published from February 2009 to August 2010 . Set in a world where a worldwide epidemic of a virus has turned part of the population into guignols ( zombies which resemble marionettes ) , Grand Guignol Orchestra focuses on singer Lucille and his orchestra , which destroys the guignols through music . At the 2009 New York Anime Festival , Viz Media announced that it had licensed the series for an English-language translation . It published the series under its Shojo Beat imprint , from October 2010 to December 2011 . The series has also been translated into other languages , such as German and Mandarin .

Certain types of music can restore humanity and memories to the guignols while speeding up their destruction ; the queen 's Grand Orchestra destroys guignols through music , as does the much smaller , unofficial Grand Orchestra . If an area becomes more than seventy percent infected by the virus , the queen sends her Divine Lightning ( \u795e\u96f7 , Kami Kaminari ) to destroy the area and keep the virus from spreading . The virus , however , originates from the first queen , whose father transformed her into a guignol ; subsequent queens and their potential successors are grown from her cells . Opposed to the queen 's rule is Le S\u00e9nat : consuls Richter ( \u30ea\u30c1\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c4 , Richiteraitu ) and Valentine ( \u30d0\u30ec\u30f3\u30c1\u30ca\u30a4\u30c4 , Barentinaitu ) , chancellor Meerschaum ( \u30df\u30a2\u30b7\u30e3\u30e0 , Miatsuyamu ) , and regent Jasper ( \u30b8\u30e3\u30b9\u30d1\u30fc , Jayasup\u0101 ) , all of whom have been governing for a century . = = = Story = = = The plot follows the unofficial Grand Orchestra led by singer Lucille ( \u30eb\u30c1\u30eb , Ruchiru ) , who searches for a way to rescue his younger sister Cordierite \" Cordie \" ( \u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8 , Kodiaraito ) \u2014 who now despises him as the cold-hearted Queen Gemsilica , convinced that he tricked her into becoming queen in his place . The other members include the violence-prone violinist Kohaku ( \u30b3\u30cf\u30af ) , who was bitten by a guignol ; and cellist Gwindel \" Gwin \" ( \u30b0\u30a3\u30f3\u30c7\u30eb , Guwinderu ) , a former sculptor of guignols who keeps his daughter 's hedgehog with him .

Eventually , they obtain the Black Oratorio ( \u9ed2\u306e\u8056\u8b5a\u66f2 , Kuro no Hijiri Tan Kyoku ) , rumoured to be able to destroy the queen and neutralize the virus when performed . Having left Eles behind for her own protection and unaware that she took the Black Oratorio out of fear of its effects on the orchestra , Lucille and his orchestra confront Queen Gemsilica , and find Berthier with a kidnapped Eles and the Black Oratorio . Queen Gemsilica is fatally wounded by their servant Cookiete \" Cook \" ( \u30af\u30fc\u30af\u77f3 , Kukitu ) .

Berthier , persuaded to return the Black Oratorio , kills Cook as he attempts to escape , and the music of the Black Oratorio is broadcast throughout the world by the satellites formerly used for Divine Lightning . Upon hearing the music , the guignols sing along and are destroyed . Separated from Lucille and the orchestra , Eles realizes that she can live as herself now . Later , she joyfully reunites with Lucille , and rejoins the unofficial orchestra , all of whom have been affected by the neutralization of the virus . = = Development = = Yuki noted that the title of the series was potentially misleading , as the orchestra is not composed of guignols ; she chose the word \" guignol \" \u2014 which describes hand puppets , not marionettes \u2014 for its sound . Page limitations affected the roles of Kohaku and Carnelian , Lucille 's castrato rival , although she felt that the story still ended as she had planned it . She also faced difficulty with Berthier 's character design . Initially , she planned to have him appear in a \" full-body animal suit \" costume , but decided against the idea as \" too comical . \" One of his early character designs was used for a minor character , an assassin for Le S\u00e9nat . Included with the bound-volume release of Grand Guignol Orchestra is \" Camolet Garden \" , Yuki 's 92-page romantic one-shot manga originally published in the April 2008 issue of the monthly sh\u014djo ( targeted towards girls ) manga magazine Bessatsu Hana to Yume . It focuses on Ry\u016b , who finds himself in a boys ' dormitory , where its inhabitants have ranks corresponding to a deck of playing cards . He struggles to solve the mystery of the boys ' dormitory , closed off from the outside world and where death only results in rebirth . In it , Yuki made allusions to the Victorian poem \" The Lady of Shalott \" by the English poet Alfred , Lord Tennyson . In retrospective , she felt that its setting was \" not really the best , \" and the many characters presented some difficulty in remembering . = = Release = = Written and illustrated by Kaori Yuki , Grand Guignol Orchestra appeared as a serial in Bessatsu Hana to Yume from the August 2008 issue , to the June 2010 issue .

Three volumes appeared on the list of the 300 bestselling graphic novels . The first volume sold 464 copies and appeared at the 256th spot on October 2010 ; it reached the fifteenth spot in BookScan 's list of the twenty bestselling graphic novels for September 2011 . The second volume sold an estimated 334 copies , and appeared at the 265th spot for February 2011 . The fifth volume sold an estimated 297 copies , and appeared at the 267th spot . Writing for School Library Journal 's blog Good Comics for Kids , Snow Wildsmith reviewed the first volume positively , and wrote , \" The elements her fans adore are all there : beautiful characters , gender ambiguity , horror themes , blood and gore , and , of course , gorgeous costumes . \" According to Wildsmith , the unexplained aspects of the plot helped to create interest for the readers . David Welsh of Comic World News had more mixed feelings about the first volume ; although he praised the aesthetic , premise , translation , and guignols , he wrote that Yuki 's work would be more appealing \" if she could just strike that balance between creative focus and intellectual abandon and emotional shamelessness . \" About.com 's Deb Aoki reviewed it negatively , criticizing its plot . Aoki wrote that it would only appeal to fans of Yuki . While finding aspects of the setting and costume design historically confusing and trying on the reader 's suspension of disbelief , Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network wrote that the Gwin 's backstory , the quick pacing , Yuki 's detailed art , and her frightening portrayal of zombies made the third volume \" a winning entry in an already fascinating series . \" Silverman had mixed feelings about the dense page layouts : according to her , they contributed to the narrative suspense , although they affected the reader 's ability to easily read the volume in places . In her review of the fourth volume , Silverman praised the character development and Yuki 's ability to create mysteries , although she wrote that not all readers would enjoy the numerous plot twists . She also suggested the possibility of a metaphor for the French Revolution in the series . Another reviewer for Anime News Network , Carlo Santos gave the third volume a C- ; while he praised Yuki 's illustrations and ability to create \" dramatic revelations , \" he wrote that it was overshadowed by the confusing and cluttered narrative . Sequential Tart 's Sheena McNeil reviewed the series positively , with Yuki 's art , characterization , and storytelling a source of praise . She , however , expressed her feelings of annoyance and frustration with the conclusion of the fourth volume , which saw the female characters left behind on purpose by the male members of the orchestra and then Eles ' kidnapping by Berthier . She also wrote that Yuki 's inclusion of a happy ending felt surprising compared to the rest of the story . Reviewing \" Camelot Garden \" , she enjoyed it less than Grand Guignol Orchestra , and wrote that the short story contained an implicit reference to Lewis Carroll 's children 's novel Through the Looking Glass ( 1871 ) and its character , the ever-sleeping Red King .",

It was later ported as a DVD game and for the PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) and PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) . The story , a dramatic slice-of-life , follows Makoto Ito , a high school student who becomes the ambivalent love-interest of several girls during his second term , and the effects this has on himself and his relationships with other characters . Though the game requires little interaction from users , School Days engages the player through a plot that they are given opportunities to change the course of during play . The game concludes with an ending specific to the outcome of the story , some of which became notorious for their graphic violence . 0verflow announced work on School Days in October 2004 and marketed it through public venues that showcased the game 's innovative use of anime-like cinematics and voice . The game ranked as the best-selling visual novel in Japan for the time of its release , continuing to chart in the national top 50 for nearly five months afterward . 0verflow would then go on to produce multiple sequels including a spin-off of the original story called Summer Days , and a parallel story called Cross Days . Another spin-off , Island Days , has been developed by Klon for the Nintendo 3DS . School Days was remastered as School Days HQ on October 8 , 2010 and localized in North America on June 27 , 2012 . The original game was officially discontinued April 21 , 2011 . Following the game 's release , School Days made several transitions into other media . The original story was adapted into a manga and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine Comp Ace ; it was later published into two volumes . Comic anthologies , light novels and art books were also published , as were audio dramas and several albums of music . An animated television series , two direct-to-video ( OVA ) single releases , and a concert film were also produced , the first of which became a precursor for an internet meme when its finale was pulled from broadcast . = = Gameplay = = As a visual novel , School Days contains extremely minimal gameplay . The game 's core onscreen presentation is composed of scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective . At predetermined intervals , the game pauses , and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make , or not make , on behalf of characters . Each selection branches the game 's progress up to that point in an alternate direction , while also causing the player 's love toward a character to blossom , plateau , or diminish , thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience . Being an erotic title , relationships between characters may become sexual ; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing , masturbation , oral sex and intercourse . Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases , but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored . Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game . Each route the game takes invariably concludes with an ending specific to the choices made up to that point . Depending on these choices , the outcome of the story will either be good or bad . School Days became popularly known for its bad endings , which depict the deaths of characters . In one ending titled \" The Bloody Conclusion \" , a character 's neck is slit open with a d\u014dzuki , causing her to collapse and die in a fountain of blood to the manic laughter of her assailant . In another called \" Eternally \" , a character commits suicide leaning over and falling off the roof of a school , landing headfirst on a sidewalk to the horror of other characters . The game 's good endings , by contrast , depict the well-being of characters and their relationships . In the ending \" Christmas Eve \" , a couple share an embrace in a hotel room as snow falls around a surrounding cityscape . In another titled \" Two Lovers \" , a pair of characters agree to have a polyamorous relationship with the male lead instead of rivaling with each other . Because of the numerous alternate endings that can be achieved , players who wish to watch additional endings and sex scenes will have to play through the game more than once . Unlike traditional visual novels that consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue , School Days is unusual in that it incorporates motion and voice , making it reminiscent of an animated series . Cinematics naturally play on their own , and players are afforded the ability to pause , fast-forward , and even skip those they 've seen before . Male and female voices can be muted , subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio . Progress can be saved at any time in up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play . = = Plot = = School Days focuses on the life of Makoto Ito , a first-year high school student living with his divorced and unseen mother in the fictional city of Haramihama . During his second term , he becomes infatuated with Kotonoha Katsura , a soft-spoken schoolmate who shares train rides with him to and from campus . When his homeroom seating plan is rearranged , he becomes acquaintances with Sekai Saionji , an upbeat girl who takes a special interest in his newfound crush , befriending the two and providing them the grounds to meet . In spite of her triumphant efforts however , Sekai becomes jealous of the new couple , having developed feelings for Makoto herself . = = Development = = School Days was 0verflow 's tenth game to develop . News of School Days first surfaced on October 5 , 2004 when 0verflow posted a link to the game 's then-live website and development log on their official site . In the blog , 0verflow revealed that School Days had been in pre-production for roughly two years and would be a fully animated game . Updates on the development of the game were scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays , and the company encouraged fans to attend Dream Party 2004 , an upcoming anime convention at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake , on October 11 , where it would make its first public showcase of the game and characters . A follow-up of the venue was made on October 15 . Toward the end of the month on October 26 , 0verflow posted that new information about School Days would be circulated in the November issue of Tech Gian , an adult magazine published by Enterbrain . Promotion for the game began shortly after . In a November 6 development post , 0verflow announced that it was planning a public screening of new game material , but was experiencing difficulty acquiring space for it . The company had initially chosen to have the venue in Akihabara but was unable to find a retailer willing to host it , prompting a visit to Osaka the following week . News that the game would contain music by artists such as Minami Kuribayashi , Haruko Momoi , Yozuca * and YURIA was posted on November 30 , along with a release date change to February 25 , 2005 . On December 28 , 2004 , 0verflow released a public trial of School Days and announced that the company would be attending Comiket 67 at Tokyo Big Sight from December 29 to 30 , handing out phonecards to the first 50 visitors to their booth . Two months later , on February 2 , 2005 , the company announced that the game had been postponed again to April 28 . From April 5 to April 8 , 0verflow concluded their development log with comments from Soyogi T\u014dno , Kaname Yuzuki , Tatsuya Hirai , Yuki Matsunaga , Hikaru Isshiki and Hana Yamamoto , the respective voices of Kotonoha , Sekai , Makoto , Otome , Hikari and Setsuna . To address bugs that were later found in the game , 0verflow released a patch to bring School Days to a stable build of 1.11 . On June 26 , 2007 , 0verflow and Lantis-net radio began to air an internet radio drama called \" Radio School Days \" . Broadcasts finished up March 28 , 2008 with 39 episodes aired . On April 21 , 2011 , 0verflow announced via their blog that support for School Days was being discontinued . = = = Release history = = = School Days was ported to three other platforms . The first of these was by AiCherry , an interactive movie developer , who announced on August 20 , 2007 that it had picked up the game for development , releasing it as a four disc DVD game on September 28 . That same year , on August 31 , Interchannel posted a link on their blog to the official website of School Days L \u00d7 H , a PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) port in development by Guyzware , that would be edited of explicit sexual content . The game was released on January 17 , 2008 and assessed by the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization ( CERO ) , Japan 's primary video game content rating system , receiving a 15-years-or-older \" C \" rating for sexual themes and profanity . The third and final port was developed by PalaceGame for the PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) . After postponing the game on May 11 , it was released as four UMDs on June 30 , 2010 . 0verflow opened what would become the homepage for School Days HQ on May 21 , 2010 , a remastering of the original game initially scheduled for release in August . The site was finished June 3 , and on July 16 , the game was postponed to September 24 . A trial was publicly released for download on August 7 , and from August 20 to September 28 , 0verflow promoted the game . Customers who had purchased the original School Days would be given the opportunity to upgrade to HQ for a fee until October 11 , by either mailing in their game disc or visiting stores in Akihabara , Osaka or Nagoya . Distributors offered collectable phonecards for reservations , and after a second date change on September 10 , the game was released October 8 . On March 3 , 2011 , 0verflow acknowledged Sekai Project , an unofficial fan translation group , who had reportedly begun localizing School Days in April 2006 . Partnering with American distributor JAST USA , School Days HQ , uncensored in English , was announced for a North American release on March 11 , 2011 . Development instead continued into 2012 , and on May 18 , JAST announced that the company had begun taking pre-orders for the Collector 's Edition , a bundled release of the game packaged with a keychain and mousepad . The company announced weeks later on June 1 that School Days HQ had gone gold . Following news on June 26 that the company would exhibit the game at Anime Expo 2012 , JAST made an update to the June 1 announcement that School Days HQ had begun shipping .

The first is Snow Radish Vacation released on December 28 , 2001 , followed by Summer Radish Vacation on April 1 , 2003 and finally Summer Radish Vacation 2 on August 13 , 2004 . A spin-off titled Summer Days , was released on June 23 , 2006 , retelling the original game during summer vacation and from the perspective of Setsuna Kiyoura . Unlike its predecessor , however , Summer Days was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state , loads of patches , and recall . Another spin-off titled Cross Days was released on March 19 , 2010 . Set in the same continuity as School Days , Cross Days follows the life of another protagonist , Yuuki Ashikaga , a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls , Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura , during his second term at Sakakino Academy . The game also features yaoi scenarios , during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid . 0verflow released Shiny Days on February 2 , 2012 which establishes a solid link between the Days series and Radish Vacation series . A third spin-off , Island Days , was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3 , 2014 .

Concrete news of this first appeared on June 1 , 2007 , when 0verflow announced via its blog that the show 's official website had gone live . Stations participating in the broadcast included TV Kanagawa , Chiba TV , TV Aichi , TV Osaka , TV Saitama and AT-X , the premiere of which would air on TV Kanagawa on July 3 . The anime was aired until September 27 and finished its broadcast on AT-X. From September 26 , 2007 to February 27 , 2008 , the series was compiled into six limited and regular edition DVDs . TNK also produced two direct-to-video ( OVA ) episodes of School Days . The first , titled \" Valentine Days \" , was bundled with limited edition copies of School Days L \u00d7 H , and features an unrelated comedic romp through Valentine 's Day as Kotonoha , Sekai , and Otome try to give Makoto giri chocos . The second , \" Magical Heart Kokoro-chan \" , jaunts the series into magical girl territory , portraying Kokoro Katsura as the superheroine Magical Heart ; it was released on March 26 , 2008 . Discotek Media has acquired the television series and the \" Magical Heart Kokoro-chan \" OVA to be released on DVD on June 24 , 2014 with English subtitles . = = = = Delay of finale = = = = On September 17 , 2007 , the day before the twelfth and final episode of the televised anime was to air on TV Kanagawa , a sixteen-year-old girl murdered her forty-five-year-old father in their Kyoto home with an axe . TV Kanagawa promptly cancelled the Tuesday airing of the finale for its similarly violent content , replacing it instead with a thirty-minute video slideshow of scenery footage played to August Wilhelmj 's \" Air on the G String \" . Newspapers such as The Japan Times and Mainichi Shimbun reported on the killing and episode preempt on September 19 . According to Mainichi Shimbun , Chiba TV and TV Aichi had also cancelled their airings , with AT-X the only station remaining indecisive . 0verflow issued an apology through their blog the same day , asking viewers to stay tuned for updates . In the following week , 0verflow announced that it had arranged for two screenings of the edited finale at the Akihabara 3D Theater on September 27 . Those wishing to attend would be required to register a seat by email , be at least 18 years old with photo ID , and bring a Windows copy of School Days or Summer Days . That same day AT-X announced that it had decided to air the unedited finale on September 27 and October 1 . In the wake of the broadcast change , a screen capture of the Norwegian M / S Skagast\u00f8l from the slideshow surfaced on the Internet alongside the caption \" Nice boat . \" , a phrase which gained popularity in Japan . Google Trends recorded a spike in \" Nice Boat \" searches around the third-quarter of 2007 while Yomiuri Shinbun , a Japanese newspaper , reported that \" Nice boat \" was the tenth most popular Yahoo ! Japan search from September 17 to September 23 . Nice Boat had become so well known that it was used in other media . The meme appeared as an Easter egg in the first episode of Ef : A Tale of Memories . , and was parodied on February 13 , 2009 when the Kadokawa Pictures YouTube channel uploaded a short montage of sailboats instead of the previously scheduled premiere of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya . 0verflow capitalized on the popularity of the phrase , naming their booth at Comiket 73 \" Nice boat . \" and selling meme inspired merchandise . TNK also paid homage to the meme in \" Magical Heart Kokoro-chan \" , a special direct-to-video episode of the animated series . = = = Concert film = = = Besides the video releases of the School Days anime , a concert film , the School Days Secret Live DVD , was also produced by HOBiRECORDS .

It was directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and written by Gen Urobuchi , with original character designs by Ume Aoki , character design adaptation by Takahiro Kishida , and music by Yuki Kajiura . The story follows a group of female middle school students who choose to become magical girls and must battle surreal enemies called witches . However , they consequently learn of the anguish and perils associated with their newfound roles . The first ten episodes of the series aired in Japan on TBS and MBS between January and March 2011 , while the final two episodes were delayed until April 2011 due to the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami . A manga adaptation of the series and various spin-off manga series have been published by Houbunsha and licensed in North America by Yen Press . A novelisation by Nitroplus was released in August 2011 , and a dedicated magazine , Manga Time Kirara Magica , was launched by Houbunsha in June 2012 . A video game for the PlayStation Portable was released in March 2012 , with another for PlayStation Vita released in December 2013 . A film series has also been produced , consisting of two films recapping the anime series , released in October 2012 , and a third film featuring an original story which was released on October 26 , 2013 . A concept film acting as a trailer for a new project was screened in December 2015 . Puella Magi Madoka Magica has received widespread critical acclaim , with critics praising the writing , visuals and soundtrack of the series , as well as its unorthodox approach to the magical girl subgenre . It has also been a commercial success , with each BD volume selling more than 50,000 copies . The series won several awards in Japan , such as the Television Award at the 16th Animation Kobe Awards , as well as 12 Newtype Anime Awards and the Grand Prize for animation in the 2011 Japan Media Arts awards . = = Plot = = In the fictional city of Mitakihara , Japan , a middle school student named Madoka Kaname and her friend Sayaka Miki encounter a small , cat-like creature named Kyubey . It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting against witches . Meanwhile , a transfer student and magical girl named Homura Akemi tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey at all costs . Madoka and Sayaka then meet Mami Tomoe , an upperclassman at the same school who is also a magical girl and offers to bring them along on her witch hunts so that they may learn of the responsibilities that come with being a magical girl . As Madoka contemplates accepting the contract with Kyubey , she witnesses the death of Mami at the hands of a witch and realizes that a magical girl 's life is filled with danger , anguish , and suffering . This is further enforced by the appearance of Kyoko Sakura , a veteran magical girl whose wish indirectly caused the death of her family . Madoka also discovers that not only do magical girls give up their souls to form their Soul Gems , the source of their magic , but when those Soul Gems become too tainted with despair , they transform into the very witches they fight against . This is exemplified when Sayaka , heavily disillusioned with the current state of the world , falls into an irrecoverable despair that turns her into a witch . It is then revealed that Kyubey 's alien race is harvesting the emotions from magical girls to use as energy to counteract the spread of entropy . Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times in order to try to save her from a grisly fate . After these revelations , Madoka decides to become a magical girl with the wish to stop witches before they are created . This rewrites the laws of the universe , resulting in Madoka becoming nothing more than a concept and Homura being the only one who remembers her in the new world that is formed . = = Production = = While collaborating on Hidamari Sketch and Bakemonogatari , Akiyuki Shinbo expressed to Aniplex producer Atsuhiro Iwakami his desire to create a new magical girl series , thus spawning the development of Puella Magi Madoka Magica . During the early planning stage , Iwakami decided not to adapt an existing work in order to give Shinbo more freedom in his direction style . Another goal of the project was to develop an anime that could appeal to a wider audience than the usual demographic for media within the magical girl genre . Iwakami and Shinbo intended for their series to be accessible to \" the general anime fan . \" Shinbo then contacted Gen Urobuchi to work on the project as a scriptwriter and Ume Aoki as a character designer . Takahiro Kishida was also enlisted to adapt Aoki 's character designs for production of the television series . In his role as producer , Iwakami took a mostly hands-off approach . Due to Puella Magi Madoka Magica being an original series rather than an adaptation based off an already existing work , he described the main goal solely as \" coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment \" . After helping to recruit the staff , he allowed them mostly free rein in developing the actual content of the story , providing minimal guidance from himself . After viewing the character designs that Aoki created , he became fully assured that he could trust the creative talent of the team . In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan , Iwakami summed up his philosophy as \" I don 't matter much ; it 's up to those talents to do their work . If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene , but they did an excellent job and I was very happy seeing the results in episode one . \" = = = Writing = = = During the pre-writing planning phase , Iwakami simply requested that Urobuchi make the storyline \" heavy \" . Furthermore , Shinbo specified that it should contain copious amounts of blood and violence , elements that were unusual to the magical girl genre . The director also specifically sought for many of the magical girl characters to be killed throughout the series . Urobuchi admitted he had no trouble with these requirements , referencing his past reputation as a writer of very dark and somber stories , the extent of which Shinbo had not fully known . One objective was for the script to starkly contrast with the way the anime was to be marketed . Shinbo planned for the series to be advertised in an innocent and pure manner that would deliberately conceal its dark undertones . For example , the title logo for the anime was rendered using rounded fonts that would appear more harmless to audiences . Urobuchi further misled fans following the development of the anime by using his Twitter account to try to convince them that the plot of the series was very innocuous . The true nature of the series was disguised because Shinbo strongly desired for its dark themes to come as a complete surprise to the viewer . Iwakami later defended the mature themes in the Puella Magi Madoka Magica , stating \" the story of Madoka is serious but it 's not entirely inappropriate for children . For example , there 's nothing sexually explicit in it . There 's some death , but it 's not gratuitous ; it can be explained within the context of the story . \" Otherwise , Shinbo granted Urobuchi a large amount of autonomy in writing the series and determining the path of the story . In describing his interactions with Iwakami and Shinbo while collaborating on the series , Urobuchi commented that \" neither one is the type to show their hand , they would always wait for me to make the next move . \" In his effort to create a successful deconstruction of the magical girl genre , Urobuchi studied aspects of traditional magical girl media that were \" troubling or overlooked \" . He also stated that the development of the plot was heavily influenced by the character drawings he saw Aoki design . Other inspirations he credited for contributing to the series included horror fiction author Stephen King as well as previous projects that Shinbo directed such as Hidamari Sketch and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha . Urobuchi attributed his past experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and Y\u014dsuke Kuroda as a major influence in his writing for Puella Magi Madoka Magica , and has referred to both of them as his mentors . To set the initial pacing of the series , Urobuchi used a technique he credited as originally from Kuroda . The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context , the second episode would then define the particular rules governing the story 's setting , and the third episode would be responsible for divulging the revelation in the plot so as to hook the viewer . The twist in the third episode was determined during the project proposal stage and involved the death of Mami , a main character figure . This decision was controversial , and Urobuchi recalled production staff members continually approaching him and asking him to reconsider due to their own fondness for the character . However , he refused and the plot remained unchanged during production . Nevertheless , Urobuchi realized that this progression could be very hard for viewers to accept and might hurt the overall series ' success with some audiences , commenting : \" I always thought this is an age where entertainment basically is about soothing and healing , like adopting a style where unchanging day-to-day life is to continue forever . \" In an interview with Ultra Jump Egg , Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy , stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story was more important than the characters within it . He indicated that he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name , and contrasted this with other writing methods which first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow . He again defended his decision to have Mami die , claiming that this could actually have the converse effect of making her character even more memorable , saying , \" I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died , like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJo 's Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star . Precisely because of the way they died , they were able to live forever . \" = = = Character design = = = Urobuchi stated that Sayaka was his favorite character overall , and remarked that her plotline was the most enjoyable to write . Due to her grim fate by the end of the series , a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair , he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared . Urobuchi declined , asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story . Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could be brought back to life , admitting he had become very attached to the character . However , Urobuchi again refused , explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story . Shinbo finally acquiesced to this , but remarked that he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls . The alien character Kyubey was also envisioned and designed by Urobuchi . As one of the primary antagonists in the series , Iwakami stated that \" the mash-up of cuteness and darkness is the central theme to Madoka , and Kyubey is an epitome of that theme . \" A central goal in Urobuchi 's writing was to highlight the moral and ethical dissonance between Kyubey and the young middle school girls , which was done through actions in the series such as Kyubey eating its own corpse in order to recycle energy . He compared the character to monsters occurring in the works of horror fiction author H. P. Lovecraft , commenting of Kyubey : \" he isn 't evil , it is his lack of feelings that make him scary . \" Urobuchi further remarked upon the moral ambiguity that the series displays in an interview with Asahi Shimbun , stating \" Al-Qaeda brought down the Twin Towers due to their self-righteousness . Justice for some people is an evil for others . Good intentions , kindness , and hope will not necessarily make people happy . \" Due to unforeseen scheduling problems with Shaft , production for the series was postponed for three years following the completion of its writing . However , once the issues were resolved , production began without any further complications . The animation studio spearheaded the conception and design of the witches in the series , as well as creating each one 's individual backstory . Urobuchi had originally envisioned the witches to be similar to conventional monsters such as Godzilla , but upon seeing the surreal concept art for one of the main witches , Walpurgis Night , he remarked : \" How can Homura possibly fight against something like this ? \" Designers from Shaft also added quotes from the German folklore legend Faust to the series . Throughout production , the animation production team Gekidan Inu Curry had freedom to insert new details or modify existing ones from the original script . An example is during a scene in the final episode where the team added black wings to Homura , something which was not included in Urobuchi 's writing . Urobuchi praised this aspect of the production , commenting that \" additions by the animation production team added more mystery and depth to [ the ] characters , and without them , it would have been very difficult to write any further stories in the world of the series \" . = = = Music = = = Iwakami and Shinbo recruited Yuki Kajiura to compose the soundtrack for the series after Urobuchi recommended her . Shinbo had previously worked with Kajiura on Le Portrait de Petit Cossette , and Urobuchi told of the inspiration the music from that series had on him while writing parts of the script . Stating that he had long been a fan of her anime soundtracks , Urobuchi also praised Kajiura 's work ethic , remarking that she would always fully familiarize herself with the plotline of the story while composing for it . Japanese pop music duo ClariS was also commissioned to perform \" Connect \" ( \u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30c8 , Konekuto ) , the opening theme of the series . Iwakami involved himself directly in the song 's development to ensure that it would fit with the series , marking one of the only times that he explicitly intervened in an aspect of the production . Both \" Connect \" and the ending theme , \" Magia \" by Kalafina , were revealed in a television commercial several weeks before the series ' premiere in Japan . = = Broadcast and distribution = = On January 7 , 2011 , Puella Magi Madoka Magica debuted on Mainichi Broadcasting System ( MBS ) , Tokyo Broadcasting System ( TBS ) , and Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting ( CBC ) in Japan . The first ten episodes aired weekly without interruption , and were also available for streaming on Nico Nico Douga and BIGLOBE 's Anime One service . However , due to the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami in March , the planned broadcasts for the last two episodes were halted . Additionally , TBS elected to cancel its scheduled airing of the 10th episode in order to provide more news coverage of the natural disaster . Due to these delays , Urobuchi issued an apology to viewers . However , he also indicated that the postponements could be viewed in a positive light because they alleviated some production pressures placed on animation studio Shaft due to the tight broadcast schedule . Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12 , Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes immediately up until their new air time . Furthermore , Urobuchi remarked that if episode 11 in its current state had been aired as scheduled , the result most likely would have been disappointing . On March 23 , 2011 , the broadcast for the rest of the series was delayed indefinitely . However , the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April . Finally , on April 10 , 2011 , the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April 21 . Episodes 11 and 12 aired back-to-back on MBS to conclude the series , while TBS and CBC ran episode 10 in addition to 11 and 12 . Iwakami later commented on this unique production experience in an interview with Anime News Network . He mentioned that Shaft was always pressed for time during the production process and only just managed to complete each episode right before its air time . After the earthquake and tsunami occurred , he stated that much of the staff was rattled by the incident and because of this they were not able to work effectively on episodes 11 and 12 . However , in overcoming this situation , he remarked \" a week went by , and two weeks went by , and the staff started saying that they couldn 't stay in shock forever , that they had to keep on going , and then production continued . \" The series was released on six Blu-ray Disc ( BD ) and DVD volumes between April 27 and September 21 , 2011 , having been delayed from the original release date of March 30 , 2011 due to the earthquake . Drama CDs were included with the first , third and fifth BD / DVD volumes . The sixth and final volume released on September 21 , 2011 contains a director 's edit of episode 12 .

Shaft representative director and president Mitsutoshi Kubota later confirmed in an interview in Newtype that the concept film will launch a new Puella Magi Madoka Magica project . = = Reception = = = = = Critical reception = = = Puella Magi Madoka Magica has received widespread critical acclaim . In his 10 out of 10 review , UK Anime Network 's Andy Hanley lauded the series for its deeply emotional content and described it as immersive and filled with grandiose visuals along with an evocative soundtrack . Additionally , he recommended that viewers watch it several times in order to fully comprehend the complex and multilayered plotline . He went on to claim that it was the greatest TV anime series of the 21st century thus far . Scott Green of Ain 't It Cool News commented that the series was \" hugely admirable \" and he would give it the highest possible recommendation to anyone even slightly interested in anime . He also praised the animation team 's attention to detail , stating that the series \" would not work nearly as well if the characters in general and as magical girls specifically weren 't presently so spectacularly winningly by the production . \" T.H.E.M. Anime reviewer Tim Jones criticized what he regarded as weak character development but nevertheless remarked that the series was \" beautiful , well-written , and surprisingly dark \" and gave it four out of five stars . In the review , Jones also commended the unique animation and design of the backdrops shown during witch fights , which he described as surreal and \" trippy \" , but beautiful . In his review of the three BD volumes of the anime series , Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network characterized the story as very emotionally dark and \" one of the most ambitious and beautiful anime series in recent memory . \" He went on to award each of the volumes A or A + overall ratings . The darker approach to the popular magical girl subgenre in Japanese anime and manga was also a point of high praise by reviewers . In its take on the series , the staff at Japanator remarked that this trope \" added a level of depth and complexity to the genre that we haven \u2019 t ever seen , and I don \u2019 t think we will see again . [ ... ] Adding on that dressing gave the show a more perverse and cruel feeling to it , making it all the more compelling to watch . \" Liz Ohanesian of LA Weekly attributed the genre deconstruction of Puella Magi Madoka Magica to the series ' popularity with older , male audiences , an otherwise unusual demographic to the genre . Furthermore , she commented on cultural impact that the series produced , observing that in both Japan and the US there has been incredible fan captivation surrounding the series . She credited the all-star crew including writer Urobuchi , director Shinbo , and the Shaft animation studio as \" hitmakers \" and described the anime as \" a series designed for acclaim . \" TechnologyTell 's Jenni Lada warned that the show 's external appearance belied its true \" darker and more twisted \" essence . She recommended viewers watch at least three episodes in order to discover the series ' true nature . Production I.G 's Katsuyuki Motohiro watched Puella Magi Madoka Magica after hearing opinions that it exceeded Neon Genesis Evangelion . Upon viewing the series , he was so amazed that he began analyzing Urobuchi 's other works and was then motivated to request Urobuchi to write the crime thriller Psycho-Pass . = = = Sales and accolades = = = The first BD volume sold 53,000 copies in its first week , 22,000 of which were sold on its first day , breaking the record previously held by the sixth BD volume of Bakemonogatari . The second volume sold 54,000 copies , breaking its own record . Each subsequent volume has managed to sell over 50,000 copies in its first week . This was despite controversy over the pricing of the volumes which some considered to be unfairly high . The staff at Japanator stated they could not recommend that their readers buy the volumes due to the prohibitive cost . Bertschy concurred , writing that the \" limited episode count and high price of entry make the show inaccessible to an audience unwilling to shell out . \" The Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper reported that before the release of the third movie , the anime had grossed a total of 40 billion yen in the sales of related goods . A live broadcast of the entire series streamed on Nico Nico Douga on June 18 , 2011 garnered around 1 million viewers , surpassing the previous record of 570,000 held by Lucky Star . The show won the Television Award at the 16th Animation Kobe Awards , as well as 12 Newtype Anime Awards and the Grand Prize for animation in the 2011 Japan Media Arts awards . It also won three Tokyo Anime Awards in the Television Category , Best Director and Best Screenplay , and the Selection Committee Special Prize award at the 2012 Licensing of the Year awards . Madoka Magica was awarded a Seiun Award for \" Best Media \" at the 2012 Japan Science Fiction Convention . In 2015 , the show was also awarded the inaugural Sugoi Japan Grand Prix , Japan 's nationwide vote for manga , anime , and novels considered as cultural assets that have the potential to be beloved all over the world , among all the works published since 2005 .",

                    "text": "Pig Bride = Pig Bride ( Korean : \uc815\uccb4\ubd88\uba85 \uc0c8\uc0c9\uc2dc ) is a manhwa written and illustrated by Huh Kook-hwa ( \ud5c8\uad6d\ud654 ) and Kim Su-jin ( \uae40\uc218\uc9c4 ) . The story follows Si-Joon Lee , who was tricked as an eight-year-old boy , into fulfilling a prophecy and marrying the mysterious \" Pig Bride \" - a young blonde girl who hides her supposedly disfigured face under a pig-faced mask . When Si-Joon turns sixteen , the Bride reappears and causes havoc , interrupting the blossoming romance between Si-Joon and classmate Doe-Doe . The series was released in five volumes between 2007 and 2008 in South Korea by Haksan Publishing and later localized by Yen Press for North American distribution . Yen Press also serialized Pig Bride in Yen Plus , a manga anthology . Yen Press 's localization kept the Korean onomatopoeia and sound effects and used Anglicization followed by the English translation . Reception of the initial volumes was mixed and the entire series was reviewed negatively by Manga Critic 's Katherine Dacey as one of the worst manga of 2009 . The artwork and styling received mixed praise , but the manhwa-style artwork was noted to be a divisive aspect for readers . = = Plot = = Rebellious and spoiled eight-year-old Si-Joon Lee is sent to a summer camp in the mountains by his senator father . He escapes and finds himself lost , but is saved when he finds a house in the middle of nowhere . A mysterious woman who lives there reveals to him that he is part of an ancient prophecy and must marry her daughter , Mu-Yeon , a descendant of the Park family of the ' Park Bride ' folktale . The daughter is a small girl of Si-Joon 's age who hides her face behind a smiling pig mask . Tempted by food , Si-Joon agrees to the marriage . That night , Mu-Yeon tells him she will meet him on his sixteenth birthday . True to her words , on his sixteenth birthday , she appears before Si-Joon with her sister and bodyguard , Mu-Hwa . A holy priest who serves Si-Joon 's family reveals that the marriage must commence and the prophecy must be fulfilled or Si-Joon will die before the year ends . Si-Joon attempts to live his life normally , but begins to experience flashbacks involving his past life and Mu-Yeon . The last volume 's epilogue reveals that Mu-Yeon became South Korea 's first female president , Si-Joon continues to \" work behind the scenes \" , Ji-Oh became a doctor , Mu-Hwa became the head of Secret Service , and Doe Doe became a banker . = = Production = = Huh had difficulty in designing the Pig Girl 's mask and attempted several different designs which were rejected before arriving at the chosen mask , but cannot imagine Mu-Yeon wearing any other mask now . Yen Press licensed Pig Bride for an English-language release in North America and began serializing it in the manga anthology Yen Plus . The final issue of Yen Plus in July 2010 contained the conclusion to Pig Bride . The English localization process included Korean onomatopoeia and sound effects with the anglicized word followed by the English translations . Signage and text is commonly written with English translations in or near the panel it appears instead of replacing the original text . = = Volume list = = = = Reception = = Joy Kim of Manga Life also praised the art style saying the characters were distinctive . She criticized the relationship of the lead couple , Si-Joon Lee and Mu-Yeon Park , saying that Mu-Yeon should not be so sweet and protective of someone who does not return her feelings . Kim praised the character Ji-Oh Yun as the most interesting character in the series and that his relationship with Mu-Hwa Park is interesting . Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf reviewed the first volume and concluded that despite being \" somewhat muddled , the visual storytelling is not . The art is clean , lovely , and easy to follow , with a nicely restrained use of elaborate backgrounds and imaginative panel layouts . The character designs are pretty , distinct , and occasionally even creepy , as with Mu-Yeon 's eternally smiling mask . The overall look is undeniably \" manhwa \" \u2013 a draw for some and a turn-off for others . \" Erin Jones of Mania.com noted the distinct and typical romance story in the first volume , but found the first volume enjoyable and noted that the interactions of the \" Pig Girl \" are what will drive the series despite the volume ending without strong development of the characters . A review of volume two by Pop Culture Shock gave it a \" B + \" despite confusion caused by the plot and \" vagueness on the villain front , Pig Bride is still a very entertaining tale . \" The series was received negatively by Katherine Dacey of Mangacritic.com where it was listed as fifth on Manga Critic 's \" The 2009 Manga Hall of Shame Inductees \" . Dacey criticized the series ' lack of comedy , art style , and the personality of girls stating the author must hate girls . Kurt Hassler of Yen Press rebutted Mangacritics review and disagreed and praised the characters and the art style . Hassler 's response to the review led to Dacey modifying her review to specify it was not hatred of women , but of the characters . Hassler also highlighted a quote from a review by Julie of Manga Maniac Cafe , a personal website , which stated , \" The art alone makes this title worthy of a read , with its fine lines , elegant details , and overall attractiveness \u2026 the vision revealed inside this book is gorgeous . Dramatic and comedic scenes are played out with equal effectiveness , making the visuals a joy to behold . \"",

It was first released for the PlayStation 2 on December 28 , 2004 as an all-ages title , and was followed by an adult version playable on Microsoft Windows and subsequent all-ages versions for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 . This deviated from the release history of the game 's predecessor , To Heart , which was originally released with adult content prior to receiving versions with such content removed . The gameplay in To Heart 2 follows a branching plot line with multiple endings , which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction based on the player 's decisions . Its story centers on the male protagonist Takaaki Kouno , and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters . The game was positively received in both sales and popularity . Its original PlayStation 2 release sold more than 82,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan , and it was voted as the third best bish\u014djo game by the readers of Dengeki G 's Magazine in 2007 . It has since received several spin-off titles , including a sequel entitled To Heart 2 Another Days , which was released on February 29 , 2008 for Windows , and has also made transitions to other media . There have been six anime adaptations of To Heart 2 : an anime television adaptation produced by OLM 's Team Iguchi , which was first broadcast in Japan between October 3 , 2005 and January 2 , 2006 ; and five original video animation series produced by Aquaplus and Chaos Project . Four manga series , fifteen sets of manga anthologies , three Internet radio shows , two drama CDs , and six novel adaptations based on To Heart 2 have also been produced . = = Gameplay = = To Heart 2 is a romance \" novel-type adventure game \" in which the player assumes the role of Takaaki Kouno , who begins his second year of high school after reuniting with a childhood friend . Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story 's narrative and dialogue . The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites , which represent who Takaaki is talking to , appearing over background artwork . Throughout the game , the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story , which take the place of the background art and character sprites . A gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music is available on the game 's title screen . To Heart 2 follows a branching plot line with multiple endings , and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game , the plot will progress in a specific direction . The game divides each school day of the storyline into four segments . These segments illustrate the events that occur during Takaaki 's commute to school , during school , after school , and after he returns home at the end of each day . Depending on the time of the day and the player 's actions , he or she may be presented one of three types of events : mandatory events , which occur automatically during certain points in the game 's plot line ; temporary events , which occur during certain periods of time only if specific conditions are met ; or after school events , which occur at the end of each school day . At the end of each school day , the player will be given the option to navigate to various locations within the game 's setting . Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make . Throughout gameplay , the player is given multiple options to choose from . Text progression pauses at these points , and depending on the choices that the player makes , the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase , decrease , or remain the same . This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into , but influences the story only during Konomi 's and Karin 's plot lines . In the PlayStation 2 version , there are nine plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience , one for each of the heroines in the story except Sango and Ruri , who share the same plot line . This is expanded to ten plot lines in the Windows and PlayStation Portable versions with the addition of Sasara 's scenario , and further expanded to eleven scenarios in the PlayStation 3 version with the addition of Mio 's scenario . In order to view all of the plot lines , the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in alternate directions . In all versions , the game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios . This ending serves as the basis of the Another Days scenario in To Heart 2 Another Days , which allows the player to pursue an additional seven heroines . To Heart 2 X Rated , the Windows version of the visual novel , includes two additional minigames that serve to lengthen the experience the game provides ; these minigames do not affect the main plot in any way . In both minigames , the player controls one of the heroines from To Heart 2 's storyline , who is made available upon the completion of her scenario in the main portion of the game . The first of the two minigames , titled \" Super Sweets Scramble \" ( \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30c4\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb , S\u016bpaa Suiitsu Sukuranburu ) , is a scrolling shooter in which the player 's goal is to progress through a vertically scrolling level , while attacking enemies that resemble confectioneries and dodging their attacks . The second , titled \" Dokidoki Panic Library \" ( \u30c9\u30ad\u30c9\u30ad\u3071\u306b\u3063\u304f\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc , Dokidoki Panikku Raiburar\u00ef ) , is a puzzle game in which the player competes against an opponent for the highest score , by connecting three or more books of the same color and eliminating them from the screen . = = Plot and characters = = To Heart 2 's story revolves around the male protagonist Takaaki Kouno , a high school student who has an aversion to most girls around him , and focuses on his interactions with his schoolmates . The story begins on March 1 , 2004 , when Takaaki 's parents leave for an overseas business trip . That morning , Konomi Yuzuhara , Takaaki 's childhood friend , comes to meet Takaaki for their commute to school . Konomi is a cheerful and innocent , but childish girl . She is one year younger than Takaaki , who often views her as a younger sister . The two are also friends with Yuuji Kousaka , who is in the same class as Takaaki . Despite being the son of a wealthy and prestigious family , Yuuji has a frivolous and carefree personality , and often flirts with the girls at school . Takaaki later reunites with Tamaki Kousaka , another childhood friend , who had promised to return before being enrolled into a boarding school . Tamaki has a strong and dominant personality , and tends to act as an elder sister figure to those around her . She later transfers into Takaaki 's high school upon the beginning of the new school year . Throughout the story , Takaaki meets several other heroines attending his school . The first is Manaka Komaki , a timid , clumsy , but accommodating girl who is the vice class representative of Takaaki 's class . She oftens spends time in the school library 's storage , and helps the library committee with general tasks . Similar to Takaaki , she is inarticulate around the opposite gender . Manaka is also close friends with Yuma Tonami , an aggressive girl who commutes to school by a mountain bike . Yuma sees Takaaki as a rival after she first met him at school , and often challenges him to various duels . She often laments her grandfather 's insistence of having her take over the family business , and attempts to hide her family background from Takaaki . Karin Sasamori is a schoolmate of Takaaki 's and the founder of the school 's mystery club . Karin has a cheerful and energetic personality , and has an odd affection towards the occult and objects such as egg sandwiches . She first meets Takaaki early in the story , and later deceives him into joining the mystery club . Sango Himeyuri is an underclassman who takes a liking to Takaaki . She is lively and innocent , but also intelligent . She is in particular proficient in computer-related subjects , and designed multiple humanoid maid robots as an engineer for Kurusugawa Electronics . Ruri Himeyuri is another underclassman of Takaaki and Sango 's younger twin sister . In contrast to her older sister , Ruri has a bad-mouthed and hostile personality . She is very protective of Sango , and often regards Takaaki 's interactions with her in bad faith . Lucy Maria Misora is a girl whom Takaaki meets one day on his way home . She has a calm personality , and opens up to very few people except him . Lucy claims to be an alien , and speaks a unique language she calls the \" R\u016b Language \" ( \u308b\u30fc\u8a9e , R\u016bgo ) . She later attends Takaaki 's school under the name R\u016bko Kireinasora . Y\u016bki Kusakabe is a gentle and well-mannered girl who often lingers in the school building at night . She was one of Takaaki 's classmates in elementary school , but has since transferred away because of her parents ' divorce . Two heroines were subsequently added to To Heart 2 's story in later versions of the game . Sasara Kusugawa becomes the student council president of Takaaki 's school during his second year . She inherits her position from the previous president Ma-ryan , as she is the only remaining student council member after the latter 's graduation . Sasara is very diligent , often completing all of the student council 's tasks by herself . She is often feared by students for her strict attitude , but is actually disguising a shy and gentle personality . Mio Hanesaki is Takaaki 's classmate . She remains largely unnoticed by other students , most of whom remain oblivious of her name . She originally ties her hair up and wears eyeglasses , but later wears contact lens and her hair untied as an attempt by Takaaki to change the impression she gives to others . = = Development = = To Heart 2 's development originally began as a collaborative effort for the PlayStation 2 between the Osaka and Tokyo studios of Aquaplus . During one of the staff meetings for the partnered project , To Heart 2 was conceived when a staff member jokingly mentioned the possibility of a sequel for the original To Heart . Production began shortly after once the team realized the popularity and success of the forerunner . Naoya Shimokawa , the president of Aquaplus , produced the resulting project , and Tsutomu Washimi served as the game 's director . The work on the game 's scenario was split between four writers . Sh\u014dsuke Miyake drafted the game 's overall storyline as well as the scenarios for Sango , Ruri , and Lucy ; Nagare Makura wrote the scenarios for Manaka and Yuma ; Takeshi Marui for Karin and Y\u016bki ; and Munemitsu for Konomi and Tamaki . Likewise , the game 's character designs were split amongst four artists . Misato Mitsumi provided the character designs and illustrations for Konomi and Yuma ; Hisashi Kawata for Lucy and Karin ; Tatsuki Amazuyu for Tamaki and Manaka ; and Takeshi Nakamura for Sango , Ruri , and Y\u016bki . The game 's music was composed by Shimokawa , Junya Matsuoka , Shinya Ishikawa , Kazue Nakagami , and Michio Kinugasa . Since the development staff had an equal number of writers as illustrators , it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer ; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine . Though this would have simplified the project 's work load by easing communications among the staff , the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces . Ultimately , writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members ' individual preferences . The staff also commented that the development team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios . Early in production , members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development , but as production progressed , they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging . Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively , and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated , Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem . Rather than creating a new setting for To Heart 2 , the development team chose to roll over various inherent features from the original . The majority of the game is set within the same school and town , but instead focuses on the northern side of town , rather than the southern side , which is the primary setting of To Heart . The story is set two years after To Heart , and its lack of mobile phones was an attempt to replicate the technological themes of its predecessor . Despite the story 's inclusion of maid robots , the writers stated that the story 's setting was influenced by the 1990s , during which To Heart took place . As the only artist to return from the original 's development team , Kawata was consulted by the other illustrators for character designs . He commented that the other artists attempted to create their designs with respect to the previous work , but he decided otherwise by attempting to \" shape a new image \" for the designs . The illustrators avoided creating a character with green hair as a heroine , because of the overwhelming impression the character Multi had left them in To Heart . Miyake noted that it was difficult for him to write the scenario for To Heart 2 because the game 's development began during the time he was writing December When There Is No Angel , and Ruri and Sango 's original scenario had to be rewritten because of their overwhelming resemblance to the latter title . = = = Release history = = = To Heart 2 was first released as an all-ages title for the PlayStation 2 on December 28 , 2004 in three versions : a limited edition , a deluxe edition , and a regular edition .

He is somewhat of a playboy , but never gets far . [ vol . 1 ] = = Development = = Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on an earlier four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student . At that time , the main characters that make up the student council were instead members of the drama club . However , Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha 's Waai ! magazine , and she decided it would be easier to manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council . Before creating Himegoto , Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys , but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys . When she proposed the idea of Himegoto , she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls , which Tsukudani herself wanted to read . In this way , she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it . When drawing the manga , Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that were easy to read , something she felt she was unable to do well when the manga 's serialization began . What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible . When developing the characters , she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student . However , Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani 's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair , side pigtails , and him being forced to cross-dress . When developing the members of the public morals committee , Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers , which lead to Kaguya 's development . Tsukudani 's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto + , and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner , so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl . For Mitsunaga and Hiro , she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue . Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them , including what hair color they would have . Although Tsukudani kept a notebook with story ideas , she admitted that on many occasions the theme of a chapter was born out of her own daydreams . Once she decided on a theme , she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard . Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were , she noted that they moved around for her on their own . Conversely , if the characters were stiff with a given theme , Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea . The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization , as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story . = = Media = = = = = Manga = = = Himegoto is written and illustrated by Norio Tsukudani . It began serialization in volume seven of Ichijinsha 's Waai ! magazine on November 25 , 2011 as a four-panel comic strip manga , and continued until February 25 , 2014 when Waai ! suspended publication .

                    "text": "G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero ( Marvel Comics ) = G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero ( also known as G.I. Joe or A Real American Hero ) is a comic book that was published by Marvel Comics from 1982 to 1994 . Based on Hasbro , Inc . ' s G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero line of military-themed toys , the series has been credited for making G.I. Joe into a pop-culture phenomenon . G.I. Joe was also the first comic book to be advertised on television , in what has been called a \" historically crucial moment in media convergence . \" The series was written for most of its 155-issue run by comic book writer , artist , and editor Larry Hama , and was notable for its realistic , character-based storytelling style , unusual for a toy comic at the time . Hama wrote the series spontaneously , never knowing how a story would end until it was finished , but worked closely with the artists , giving them sketches of the characters and major scenes . While most stories involved the G.I. Joe Team battling against the forces of Cobra Command , an evil terrorist organization , many also focused on the relationships and background stories of the characters . Hama created most characters in collaboration with Hasbro , and used a system of file cards to keep track of the personalities and fictional histories of his characters , which later became a major selling point for the action figure line . G.I. Joe was Marvel 's top-selling subscription title in 1985 , and was receiving 1200 fan letters per week by 1987 . The series has been credited with bringing in a new generation of comic book readers , since many children were introduced to the comic book medium through G.I. Joe , and later went on to read other comics . The comic book has been re-printed several times , and also translated in multiple languages . In addition to direct spin-offs of the comic book , several revivals and reboots have been published throughout the 2000s . = = Publication history = = = = = Background = = = In the early 1980s , Hasbro noted the success of Kenner Products ' Star Wars action figures , and decided to re-launch their long-running G.I. Joe property as G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero with 3.75 inches ( 9.5 cm ) scale action figures rather than the traditional 12 inches ( 30 cm ) scale . Hasbro also decided that they wanted the new figures to have a back story . In 1981 , Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and Marvel Comics President Jim Galton met by coincidence at a charity fundraiser and Hassenfeld shared Hasbro 's plans for the G.I. Joe relaunch . Galton offered Marvel 's services as creative consultants , and Hassenfeld agreed to allow Marvel attempt to design a concept for G.I. Joe . Coincidentally Larry Hama , then an editor at Marvel , had begun to design characters and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force , about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D. , an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements . As Hama tells it , he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it and no one else would . Unable to find other writing work , he later said that , \" If they had asked me to write Barbie , I would have done that , too . \" Soon after this , Hasbro hosted a meeting with Hama , Jim Shooter , Tom DeFalco , Archie Goodwin , and Nelson Yomtov to discuss the future of the property . It was at this meeting that Goodwin suggested the idea of Cobra Command as a recurring enemy for G.I. Joe to fight ( similar to the HYDRA terrorist organization - recurring enemies to the aforementioned S.H.I.E.L.D. organization ) . Prior to this , Hasbro had not considered giving G.I. Joe an enemy . Based on the results of this meeting , Hasbro contracted Marvel to produce a comic book series featuring the toys . = = = Early development = = = The first issue was published in June 1982 , containing two stories , both of which were written by Hama . The first story , \" Operation : Lady Doomsday \" , was drawn by Herb Trimpe , who drew most of the early issues and also wrote issue # 9 , and the second story , \" Hot Potato \" , was drawn by Don Perlin . This issue introduced many basic concepts of the G.I. Joe universe , such as the Joes having a base under a motor pool , and introduced the iconic \" original 13 \" G.I. Joe Team members . The issue also introduced two recurring villains , Cobra Commander and the Baroness . Whereas Cobra Commander and the various Joes already had action figures issued , The Baroness is the earliest example of a G.I. Joe character whose first appearance in the comics predated the conception of their action figure . Most of the early stories were completed in one issue , but multi-part stories began to appear by the middle of the series ' first year of publication , and there were hints of the ongoing storylines that would later characterize the series . In May 1983 , issue # 11 introduced many new characters , including most of the 1983 action figure line and the villain Destro , who would become a frequently recurring character . Many subsequent storylines involved the machinations and power struggles between him , Cobra Commander , and the Baroness . Issue # 11 established a pattern for the series in which every so often Marvel would publish an issue introducing a group of characters and vehicles that represented the new year 's toy offerings . An early highlight was 1984 's \" Snake Eyes : The Origin \" Parts I & II , published in issues # 26-27 . This issue established Snake Eyes ' complicated background , and tied his character into many other characters , both G.I. Joe and Cobra . Hama considers it to be his favorite storyline from the Marvel run . In 1986 , echoing events portrayed in the TV series , G.I. Joe # 49 was published , introducing the character of Serpentor , a genetically created amalgam of history 's greatest warriors . Serpentor played a significant role in the Cobra Civil War , which occurred in issues # 73-76 , a landmark story event that involved nearly every G.I. Joe and Cobra character vying for control of Cobra Island . = = = Later years and cancellation = = = When G.I. Joe began , most toy tie-in comics lasted an average of two years , so G.I. Joe , lasting for 12 years , was considered a runaway success . Through the years , the comic book series chronicled the adventures of G.I. Joe and Cobra , using a consistent storyline . In the early 1990s , however , it began to drop in quality , and was canceled by Marvel in 1994 with issue # 155 due to low sales . Hasbro canceled the A Real American Hero toy line in the same year . Between the lack of new toys and the cancellation of the second TV series three years earlier , the comic book could not count on the same cross-platform support it had enjoyed in the past . The target demographic had also changed considerably . According to Hama : It reached the end of its half-life . Until G.I. Joe and Transformers , toy books had a life expectancy of 1-2 years \u2013 3 years was considered a long time . Hasbro didn \u2019 t expect the toy-line to have that much life in it . Also , the market had changed completely . When I first started doing store signings , there were lines around the block and it was all 10-year-old boys . The last time I did a story signing in New York City , everybody was over 30 , and two of the guys who showed up were mailmen who had skipped off their routes to get their books signed . The final issue featured a stand-alone story titled \" A Letter from Snake Eyes . \" Narrating from his perspective , Snake Eyes tells his story through recollections of his many comrades-in-arms who have died over the years . Shortly after the final issue , G.I. Joe Special # 1 was released in February 1995 , containing alternate art for issue # 61 by Todd McFarlane . McFarlane was the original penciller for issue # 61 , but his artwork had been rejected by Larry Hama as unacceptable , and so Marshall Rogers was brought in to pencil the final published version . In the years following , McFarlane became a superstar comic artist , and Marvel eventually decided to print the unpublished work . = = Promotion = = Hasbro used television advertising to publicize the series , and when the first one aired in 1982 featuring G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero # 1 , it was the first time a commercial had ever been used to promote a comic book . Since the commercials were technically promoting the comic books rather than the toys , they allowed Hasbro to circumvent television regulations mandating that toy commercials could not contain more than ten seconds of animation . By not showcasing any characters and toys outside of the comic book context , they were able to include a full thirty seconds of animation . Marvel was paid $ 5 million by Hasbro to produce the commercials through its animation division Marvel Productions . Larry Hama relates the genesis of the commercials : There were only a few seconds of animation you could have in a toy commercial , and you had to show the toy , so people wouldn \u2019 t get totally deluded . Somebody at Hasbro ( who was actually sort of a genius ) named Bob Pruprish , realized that a comic book was protected under the first amendment , and there couldn 't be restrictions based on how you advertised for a publication . Between the toy line , comic books , commercials and subsequent cartoon series , Hasbro 's marketing plan was highly successful and eventually became an industry standard , an early example of a practice that would years later be described by Jenkins as a \" transmedia narrative . \" Although the adolescent male demographic was the traditional comic book reader , an unintended result of the TV advertising tie-ins was that they attracted people who were not traditional comic book readers . In an interview , Hama stated : I think [ the commercials have ] also opened it up to a very different type of audience . I get a lot of letters from girls . I get a lot of letters from young housewives who sort of started watching the cartoons with their kids and sort of started getting into the characters , and then somewhere along the line they picked up the comic book and they started following the stories and got caught up in the continuity . The comic book 's popularity with women has also been attributed to the strong female characters featured in the comic , such as Scarlett and Lady Jaye . Since very few of the G.I. Joe action figures were female , Hama tended to frequently use all of the female characters , including those that were created as recurring characters in the comics . = = Writing style = = Many readers praised the series for its attention to detail and realism in the area of military tactics and procedures . Much of this was due to Hama 's military experience ( he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war ) , but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible . He frequented Sky Books , a military-oriented bookstore in New York , and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals , and also credits his friend Lee Russel , a military historian , for helping him with research . In style and plot structure , the comic often made use of overlapping story threads . According to Hama : We \u2019 ve been following one basic storyline pretty much in the comic for fifty issues . It \u2019 s sort of like an extended soap opera , although I try to have a real solid resolution at the end of each book . But I like to keep some plot threads going . There 's a sort of episodic quality to some of the earlier books , like one episode will last six issues . That will resolve completely , but two issues into it another thread may have started . At any given time there \u2019 s probably about three overlapping threads . The story arcs coincided with each of the new lines of G.I. Joe toys that Hasbro was producing , however the comic book was not directly influenced by the toy products . Of the Hasbro / Marvel relationship , Hama observed that the toy company did not demand the book to be written a certain way : We 're the final word on what happens with the book . Hasbro has been extremely open about it , [ and ] I don 't write this as a kiddie book . I don 't write G.I. Joe any differently from the way I write Wolverine . Hama wrote out page-by-page plots for all of the issues he wrote , with most pages having four to six panels . He worked very closely with the artists in plotting the book , and wrote the series spontaneously , never knowing how an issue would end until he got to the last page . = = Characterization = = In the first issue , it is revealed that the team \u2019 s official moniker is Special Counter-Terrorist Unit Delta . G.I. Joe featured an ensemble cast , with the original thirteen characters being Hawk , Stalker , Breaker , Clutch , Scarlett , Snake Eyes , Rock \u2018 n Roll , Steeler , Grand Slam , Flash , Short-Fuze , Grunt and Zap . This reflected their origins in the Hasbro toy line , with the initial characters being the same as the action figures in the original 1982 release of the toy line . The team roster expanded as additional action figures were released . Hama created most characters in collaboration with Hasbro . Hasbro would send him character sketches and brief descriptions of each character 's military specialties , and Hama would create detailed dossiers on each characters , giving them distinct personalities and background stories . Hama kept track of each character on file cards , and eventually Hasbro decided to reprint shortened versions of these dossiers as file cards on the packaging for the action figures . The file cards themselves became a selling point for the toy line , and appealed to both children and adults . Hama noted that : ... it has to be read on two levels ... A ten-year-old kid has to be able to read it and think it 's absolutely straight [ but ] there should be a joke in there for the adult . One of the factors that helped sell G.I. Joe [ figures ] was that the salesmen who sold it to retailers used the dossiers as a selling point . Hama tended to base the personalities of the characters on people that he knew , and he credits this technique for the realism of his characterization . He later said that , \" Events and continuity never meant anything to me . The important thing was the characters . \" = = Reception = = Initially , the response to the new comic book was muted due to its low status as a \" toy book . \" However its popularity eventually grew , and is credited with bringing in a new generation of comic readers . Within two months of the toy line 's launch , \" some 20 per cent of boys from ages five to twelve had two or more G.I. Joe toys \" , and by 1988 / 89 a survey conducted by Hasbro found that \" two out of every three boys between the ages of five and eleven owned at least one G.I. Joe figure . \" These boys were drawn to the G.I. Joe comic book through its association with the toy line , and then went on to other comics . As Hama puts it : It was a toy book . Very uncool to the fan-boys at the time . It never got reviewed in the fan press . Totally ignored . The kids who bought G.I. Joe were a totally new crowd who were coming into the comic shops for the first time because they had the toys and they saw the commercials . Many of them started to buy other comics while they were there . According to comic book historian John Jackson Miller , Hasbro 's promotion of the comic resulted in dramatic sales increases , from 157,920 copies per month in 1983 to 331,475 copies per month in 1985 , making it one of Marvel 's \" strongest titles . \" According to Jim Shooter , G.I. Joe was Marvel 's number one subscription title in 1985 . By 1987 , the main title was getting 1200 letters every week . Hama read every one , and sent out fifty to one hundred hand-written replies every week . An early issue that attracted much attention , both positive and negative , was G.I. Joe # 21 , titled \" Silent Interlude \" , which was told entirely without words or sound effects . In a 1987 interview , Hama explained that the motivation for the story was that he \" ... wanted to see if [ he ] could do a story that was a real , complete story \u2014 beginning , middle , end , conflict , characterization , action , solid resolution \u2014 without balloons or captions or sound effects . \" At first , the issue was controversial ; some readers felt cheated that it had no words and could be \" read \" so quickly . However , it eventually became one of the series ' most enduring and influential issues . Issue # 21 has been recognized as a modern comic classic , and has become a prime example of comics ' visual storytelling power . Comic book artist and theorist Scott McCloud ( author of Understanding Comics ) describes \" Silent Interlude \" as \" ... a kind of watershed moment for cartoonists of [ our ] generation . Everyone remembers it . All these things came out of it . It was like 9 / 11 . \" The issue would eventually be ranked # 44 in Wizard Magazine 's listing of the \" 100 Best Single Issues Since You Were Born \" , and # 6 on io9 's \" 10 Issues of Ongoing Comics that Prove Single Issues Can Be Great . \" = = Spin-offs = = In 1985 , G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero spawned an annual publication called G.I. Joe : Yearbook . G.I. Joe : Yearbook differed from the typical comic book annual publication in that it was more like a magazine . Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program , a summary of the comic book 's plot to date , and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama . G.I. Joe : Yearbook ran until 1988 . In 1986 , the success of A Real American Hero lead Marvel to produce a second title : G.I. Joe : Special Missions which lasted 28 issues . Herb Trimpe was the artist for most of the run , with Dave Cockrum providing pencils on several issues . Spinning out of G.I. Joe # 50 and set in the same continuity , the series presented more intense violence and a more ambiguous morality than the main title , and the Joes faced enemies who were not related to Cobra . Each issue usually featured a stand-alone mission focusing on a small group of Joes . Two mini-series were also produced . The first , G.I. Joe : Order of Battle , was a 4-issue mini-series running from December 1986 to March 1987 , reprinting the data found on the action figures ' file cards with some edits . Written by Hama , with all-new artwork by Trimpe , the first two issues featured G.I. Joe members , while the third issue focused on the members of Cobra Command , and the fourth highlighted the vehicles and equipment used by both organizations . A trade-paperback edition , which included material from all four issues , was published in 1987 . The second , G.I. Joe and The Transformers , was a 4-issue mini-series running from January to April 1987 . The story had the Joes and the Autobots joining forces to stop the Decepticons and Cobra from destroying the world . A trade paperback later collected all four issues . = = Reprints and revivals = = The first 37 issues of the main series were released in thirteen digests titled G.I. Joe Comic Magazine . Subsequently , Tales of G.I. Joe reprinted the first fifteen issues of G.I. Joe on a higher quality paper stock than that used for the main comic . Four Yearbooks ( 1985 \u2013 1988 ) also collected some previous stories , summarized events , and published new stories that tied into the main title , aside from the first Yearbook , which re-printed the seminal first issue . The series was also translated into several languages , including German , Spanish , Portuguese , Polish , French ( Canada ) , Swedish , Norwegian , Finnish , Danish , Japanese , Arabic , and Indonesian . G.I. Joe European Missions was published monthly from June 1988 until August 1989 . The European Missions series are all reprints of Action Force Monthly , which was published in the UK . Unlike the weekly Action Force series , these were all original stories , never before seen in the U.S. They were not written by Larry Hama . In July 2001 , Devil 's Due Publishing acquired the rights to G.I. Joe and released a four-issue limited series entitled G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero ( Reinstated ) . Strong sales led to Reinstated being upgraded to ongoing , and it lasted for 43 issues , before being relaunched as a new series G.I. Joe : America 's Elite , which lasted for 36 issues . Devil 's Due 's license with Hasbro expired in 2008 and was not renewed . Building on the success of the Devil 's Due Comics run of G.I. Joe , Marvel Comics collected the first 50 issues in five trade paperbacks , with ten issues in each book . All covers for the trade paperbacks were drawn by J. Scott Campbell . In 2009 , IDW Publishing began to re-publish the original series again as Classic G.I. Joe , and like Marvel before it , collects ten issues in each volume ; the last few collections have slightly more issues in order to conclude with the 15th paperback volume , which was published in August , 2012 . Other collections for the spin-off Special Missions and assorted Annuals also appeared . In November 2012 , IDW restarted their reprint series with the hardcover G.I. JOE : The Complete Collection , Vol . 1 , intending to reprint all the stories in reading order . IDW also revived the original G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero as an ongoing series in 2010 , with a special # 155 \u00bd issue released on Free Comic Book Day , followed by issue # 156 onwards in July 2010 .",

                    "text": "Avatar : The Last Airbender = Avatar : The Last Airbender ( Avatar : The Legend of Aang in some regions ) is an American animated television series that aired for three seasons ( referred to as \" books \" in each episode 's title card ) on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008 . Avatar : The Last Airbender is set in an Asiatic-like world in which some people are able to manipulate the classical elements by use of psychokinetic variants of Chinese martial arts , known as \" bending \" . The show combines the styles of anime and American cartoons , and relies on the imagery of various East Asian , Inuit , Southeast Asian , South Asian , and New World societies . Therefore , whether or not the series can be considered as an anime work is often discussed . The series follows the adventures of protagonist twelve-year-old Aang and his friends , who must bring peace and unity to the world by ending the Fire Lord 's war against the other three nations . The pilot episode first aired on February 21 , 2005 , and the series concluded with a widely praised two-hour episode on July 19 , 2008 . The show is obtainable from various sources , including DVD , the iTunes Store , the Zune Marketplace , the Xbox Live Marketplace , the PlayStation Store , Netflix , Amazon Video , and the Nicktoons Network . Throughout its run , Avatar : The Last Airbender was universally acclaimed by audiences and critics alike . Praises went to the art direction , humor , cultural references , characters , and themes . It was also commercially successful , garnering 5.6 million viewers on its best-rated showing and receiving high ratings in the Nicktoons lineup , even outside of its 6- to 11-year-old demographic . The series has been nominated for and won awards from the Annie Awards , the Genesis Awards , a Primetime Emmy Award and a Peabody Award , among others . The first season 's success prompted Nickelodeon to order second and third seasons . In other media , the series has spawned a critically panned , but financially successful , live-action film , titled The Last Airbender , directed by M. Night Shyamalan ; scaled action figures ; a trading card game ; three video games ; stuffed animals distributed by Paramount Parks and two Lego sets . An art book was also released in mid-2010 . A sequel series , The Legend of Korra , aired from 2012 to 2014 . = = Overview = = Avatar : The Last Airbender takes place in a world home to humans and hybrid animals , adjacent to a parallel Spirit World . Human civilization is divided into four nations : the Water Tribes , the Earth Kingdom , the Fire Nation , and the Air Nomads . Each nation has a distinct society , wherein people known as \" benders \" have the ability to manipulate and control the element of their nation using the physical motions of martial arts . The show 's creators based each bending style on an existing Chinese martial art , leading to clear visual and physical differences in the techniques used by Waterbenders ( tai chi ) , Earthbenders ( Hung Ga kung fu ) , Firebenders ( Northern Shaolin kung fu ) and Airbenders ( Baguazhang ) . In addition to these four types of bending , there are several minor subcategories of bending within them , including but not limited to : Metalbending , Sandbending ( Earth ) ; Lightning generation and redirection ( Fire ) and Bloodbending , Healing , Plantbending ( Water ) . At any given time , only one person in the world is capable of bending all four elements : the Avatar , who serves as an international arbiter . When the Avatar dies , the Avatar spirit is reincarnated into the next one of the four nations in the Avatar Cycle : the Fire Nation , Air Nomads , Water Tribe , Earth Kingdom , in order . An Avatar incarnation is born male or female , and is required to master each bending art in seasonal order , starting with its native land 's element . Additionally , the Avatar can enter a trance known as the Avatar State : normally a defense mechanism until placed , by mental discipline , under control , wherein the current Avatar briefly gains the knowledge and abilities of all past Avatars . If an Avatar were to be killed while in the Avatar State , the reincarnation cycle would end and the Avatar would never again be reborn . Through the various incarnations , the Avatar maintains a relative equality among the nations while serving as mediator between humans and spirits . The origin of the Avatar cycle is revealed in the sequel series The Legend of Korra , as the result of a young man named Wan combining his soul with the spirit Raava to imprison her opponent , Vaatu . The sequel series also revealed that bending was originally bestowed by the immense Lion Turtles , before these giant creatures renounced their roles as mankind 's protectors upon the creation of the Avatar . = = = Backstory = = = The backstory of the series ( told largely through flashback sequences ) extends backward to over 100 years before the time period in which the bulk of the series takes place , but these prelude events are revealed slowly in a fragmented , non-linear manner . More than a century before the opening events of the series , Fire Lord Sozin , ruler of the Fire Nation , planned a world war to expand his nation 's territory and influence , but was prevented from carrying out his plans by Avatar Roku . After Roku 's death , the Avatar was reincarnated as an Airbender , named Aang , who learned of his Avatar status when twelve years old . Aang , frightened of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor Gyatso , fled his home on his flying bison , Appa . The two were forced into the ocean by a storm , with Aang entering the Avatar State and encasing them both in an iceberg , in suspended animation , for one hundred years . Sozin , knowing the nature of the Avatar 's reincarnation cycle , carried out genocide of the Air Nomads during the passing of a comet that increased the Firebenders ' firepower , with the comet later renamed after him as a result , and spent his remaining days searching for the eponymous \" Last Airbender \" . As the Fire Nation 's Hundred Year War continued , Sozin was succeeded as Fire Lord by his son , Azulon , who in turn passed the title to his youngest son , Ozai , who becomes the primary antagonist of the series . = = = Season One ( Book One : Water ) = = = Katara , a fourteen-year-old Southern Tribe Waterbender , and her older brother , Sokka , find and revive Aang and Appa . Aang learns of the war occurring in his absence , and the siblings join him to reach the Northern Water Tribe at the North Pole , so that he and Katara can learn Waterbending from a master . Aang 's return attracts the attention of prince Zuko , the exiled son of Ozai , who pursues the three thereafter . Aang is also pursued by Zhao , a Fire Nation militant who intends to win Ozai 's favor and rob Zuko of his redemption . En route to the North Pole , Aang meets the Kyoshi Warriors ( established by an eponymous previous Avatar ) and his childhood friend , King Bumi , attempts to learn Firebending from the deserter Firebending master , Jeong Jeong , and gains a traveling companion in a winged lemur he names Momo . Aang discovers the genocide of his people while visiting the Southern Air Temple . During the winter solstice , Aang meets his predecessor , Roku . At the Northern Water Tribe , Aang and Katara learn advanced Waterbending from its Master , Pakku , while Sokka falls in love with Princess Yue , the tribal chief 's daughter . Zhao lays siege to the Northern Water Tribe , seizing the mortal forms of the Ocean and Moon Spirits , the source of waterbending , and thus causing a lunar eclipse . Zhao kills the moon spirit to render the Waterbenders powerless . Aang uses his Avatar State and combines with the Ocean Spirit to drive off the enemy 's fleet while Princess Yue sacrifices her life to revive the Moon Spirit . When Ozai hears of Iroh 's resistance to Zhao , he sends his daughter , Azula , to capture Iroh and Zuko . = = = Season Two ( Book Two : Earth ) = = = After leaving the Northern Water Tribe , Aang continues to master Waterbending under Katara 's tutelage as the group searches for an Earthbending teacher . Their search brings them to Toph Beifong , a twelve-year-old blind tomboy and Earthbending prodigy who wants independence from her upper-class family . Pursued by Azula , Zuko and Iroh lead new lives in the Earth Kingdom , first as wanderers and later as refugees in the capital of Ba Sing Se . At a library guarded by the spirit Wan Shi Tong , Aang and his group learn that an imminent solar eclipse could allow them to stop the Fire Nation before Sozin 's Comet arrives . Their journey to Ba Sing Se to inform the Earth King of this is complicated when Appa is kidnapped . At the city , they find the Earth King Kuei and Ba Sing Se manipulated by Long Feng , the leader of the Dai Li secret police . After Aang 's group finds Appa and exposes Long Feng , Toph is captured , but escapes by \" Metalbending \" , while Aang attempts to consciously access the Avatar state . The Dai Li join Azula to instigate a coup d '\u00e9tat of Ba Sing Se ; and Zuko , having tried to ignore his past obsession , relapses when the Avatar appears to rescue Katara . As Aang tries to enter the Avatar state , Azula nearly kills him . With Ba Sing Se and the Earth Kingdom now under Fire Nation rule , the group escapes thanks to Iroh , who is imprisoned for betraying the Fire Nation , and Kuei goes into hiding . = = = Season Three ( Book Three : Fire ) = = = Aang recovers from a long coma to find his friends and allies disguised as soldiers on a Fire Nation ship , preparing invasion of the Fire Nation . Despite receiving credit for the Avatar 's apparent death , Zuko regrets his role therein . Although the invasion meets great success at first , Aang and his friends are unable to find Ozai and are forced to retreat with many of their allies captured . At the same time , having learned of his father 's intention to destroy the Earth Kingdom at the time of Sozin 's Comet , Zuko leaves the palace to teach Aang Firebending . As the comet approaches , Aang becomes reluctant to kill Ozai , and goes alone to consult his predecessors ' spirits . Katara and the others unsuccessfully search for Aang , and find the newly escaped Iroh , joined by the other members of a secret society called the Order of the White Lotus : Bumi , Master Pakku , Jeong-Jeong , and Master Piandao ( a master swordsman who taught Sokka ) . Together , the Order of the White Lotus liberates Ba Sing Se . Sokka , Toph , and Kyoshi Warrior Suki hinder the Fire Nation 's airships , while Zuko and Katara prevent Azula from becoming the new Fire Lord . As Sozin 's Comet arrives , Aang confronts Ozai , but finds himself in a losing battle until Ozai mistakenly re-establishes Aang 's connection to the Avatar State . Thus enabled , Aang strips Ozai of his firebending powers , instead of killing him . Soon after , Zuko is crowned the new Fire Lord and initiates an armistice . The series ends in a meeting of all the protagonists at Ba Sing Se in Iroh 's tea shop , the Jasmine Dragon , where Aang and Katara hug and then kiss beneath the sunset . The camera then zooms up and into the sunset , displaying the words \" The End \" with their Chinese counterparts above them . = = Characters = = Aang ( voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen ) is the twelve-year-old , fun-loving , Airbending protagonist of the series . Although averse to fighting , Aang is fiercely protective of his friends . He is the current incarnation of the planet 's Avatar Spirit , and is therefore required to act as arbiter among the various people . According to DiMartino and Konietzko , the arrow-like tattoos on his forehead and arms mark Aang as an Airbending master ; Aang being the youngest Airbender in history to have earned them . His mentor , Monk Gyatso , was the greatest Airbender who had ever lived , according to Aang . Katara ( voiced by Mae Whitman ) is the fourteen-year-old last Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe . She and her brother Sokka accompany Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord . Eventually she becomes his Waterbending master . Katara is one of the only two surviving waterbenders of the Southern Water Tribe ( the other being Hama ) and one of only two Waterbenders able to manipulate and control human bodies by bending the water and liquids therein , known as bloodbending ( an ability used twice in the series ) . Katara is usually kind-hearted and generous , but is deeply hurt , hostile , and often angered by the slightest betrayal or ingratitude . Sokka ( voiced by Jack DeSena ) is a fifteen-year-old non-bender warrior of the Southern Water Tribe . With his younger sister Katara , he accompanies Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord . Sokka describes himself as \" meat-loving \" and \" sarcastic \" , and is often a source of comic relief . Sokka 's first love interest is Suki , the leader of the Kyoshi Island Warriors . At the end of season one , he falls in love with Princess Yue of the Northern Water Tribe . Following her transformation into the moon spirit , he mourns for her , but returns to Suki . Unlike his companions , Sokka does not have any bending ability ; his skill lies largely in mechanics and the sword . His chief weapons are a metallic boomerang , a blunt metal battle club , a Water Tribe machete , and later a black jian created from the metals of a meteorite . Toph Beifong ( voiced by Jessie Flower ) , a twelve-year-old blind female Earthbending prodigy , and Aang 's Earthbending instructor . Being blind , Toph \" sees \" by feeling vibrations in the ground through her feet using Earthbending . This ability also enables her to feel the pulses of one 's heart , allowing her to tell if someone is lying . She is later shown developing a method of ' Metalbending ' by detecting impurities in the metal . She was strictly taught only the basics of Earthbending by a tutor but learned its original form from badger-moles , the original Earthbenders . Toph also has a crush on Sokka . Zuko ( voiced by Dante Basco ) is the sixteen-year-old Firebender , exiled prince of the Fire Nation . He is the original antagonist of the first season , an antihero in the second season , and a protagonist in third season . He is determined and strong-willed , and rarely shows compassion until the third season . During season two , Zuko struggles to deal with his anger , self-pity , and complex familial relationships , as well as the choice between good and evil . He takes on the vigilante identity of the \" Blue Spirit \" throughout season one and season two . In season three , he defects from the Fire Nation to become Aang 's firebending master . At the end of the series , he is crowned ruler of the Fire Nation . Appa ( voiced by Dee Bradley Baker ) is Aang 's flying bison , who serves as the protagonists ' mode of transport around the world . He remains in suspended animation with Aang for one hundred years and shares a strong bond with him . He possesses the ability to fly and can use his tail to create powerful gusts of air . According to Aang , the flying bison were the first Airbenders . Momo ( voiced by Dee Bradley Baker ) is an intelligent and curious winged lemur discovered by Aang at the Southern Air Temple . He often picks fights with other winged and smaller creatures and with Appa over food . He can understand Aang 's speech , but less so of others ' . In \" Tales of Ba Sing Se \" , Momo 's name was written as \u6a21\u6a21 ( m\u00f3 m\u00f3 ) . Momo means \" peach \" in Japanese ( he grabbed a peach out of Sokka 's hand just as Aang was about to name him ) , but it is written \u6843 ( t\u00e1o ) . Iroh ( voiced by Mako Iwamatsu / Greg Baldwin ) is a former general of the Fire Nation , known as the Dragon of the West , and Prince Zuko 's paternal uncle and mentor . Iroh was the heir to the Fire Nation throne until Ozai usurped the throne . On the surface , Iroh is a cheerful , kind , optimistic , eccentric old man , but remains a powerful warrior and a devoted surrogate parent to Zuko . Iroh is a Grand Master of the Order of the White Lotus , a secret society of men from all nations . Unlike most Firebenders , Iroh does not use anger as the source of his strength , relying instead on Firebending secrets learned from the Dragons . Azula ( voiced by Grey DeLisle ) is the princess of the Fire Nation , Zuko 's younger sister and one of the primary antagonists of the series . Although she is much older in appearance , it is confirmed by the official website that she is intended to be 14 , making her two years younger than her brother . Azula is a Firebending prodigy and is one of the few living Firebenders capable of casting lightning . She is a cunning master at manipulation and a great leader , using fear to control her subjects and friends alike , reserving loyalty solely for her father . She is meticulous and calculating , but also a perfectionist . At the end of season three , she loses her sanity altogether as a result of a fragile mental state broken by the betrayal of her friends , the loss of her father , and her elevation to a position of power . She is defeated by Zuko and Katara in a duel . Suki ( voiced by Jennie Kwan ) is the leader of the young and exclusively female Kyoshi Warriors , a sect established by Avatar Kyoshi . She is an exceptionally skilled fighter and staunch ally of the protagonists . She was imprisoned by the Fire Nation after the Kyoshi Warriors were defeated by Azula , but she was ultimately released by Sokka and Zuko . She remained with the protagonists thereafter and fought with Toph and Sokka to disable the Fire Nation 's air force . She was Sokka 's love interest immediately following the end of the War . Mai ( voiced by Cricket Leigh ) is the best friend of Ty Lee . Mai herself lacks bending , but she is agile , swift , and skilled in throwing darts and knives . She assists Azula throughout most of her role , but she ultimately decides to abandon Azula . She is also Zuko 's girlfriend . Ty Lee ( voiced by Olivia Hack ) is an acrobat who fights alongside Azula against the protagonists , notable for her appearance of vivacity , innocence , and youth , and for her ability to disable enemies by temporarily obstructing the chi in their limbs . Having abandoned Azula , she joins the Kyoshi Warriors , whom she had earlier impersonated . Fire Lord Ozai ( voiced by Mark Hamill ) ruler of the Fire Nation , is the father of Zuko and Azula , younger brother of Iroh , and the supreme antagonist of the series . Ozai is depicted as a cruel and merciless leader , and is described as \" the worst father in the history of fathers \" by his son Zuko , of whom he reportedly thought banishment too light a punishment . He favors Azula over Zuko , because he sees her as a firebending prodigy and sees his own beliefs embodied in her . In \" Sozin 's Comet : The Final Battle \" , he renames himself the Phoenix King , ruler of the world , and appoints Azula to watch over the Fire Nation alone ; but is defeated by Aang , who removes Ozai 's ability to firebend . = = Production = = Avatar : The Last Airbender was co-created and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank , California . Animation work was mostly done by three animation studios in South Korea : JM Animation , DR Movie , and MOI Animation . According to Bryan Konietzko , the program was conceived in the spring of 2001 when he took an old sketch of a balding , middle-aged man and re-imagined the character as a child . Konietzko drew the character herding bison in the sky , and showed the sketch to Mike DiMartino . At the time , DiMartino was studying a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole . Konietzko described their early development of the concept : The co-creators successfully pitched the idea to Nickelodeon vice president and executive producer Eric Coleman just two weeks later . The series was first revealed to the public in a teaser reel at Comic-Con 2004 , and aired February 21 , 2005 . In the United States , the first two episodes of the series were shown together in a one-hour premiere event . A second twenty-episode season ran from March 17 , 2006 , through December 1 . A third and final season , beginning September 21 , 2007 , featured twenty-one episodes rather than the usual twenty . The final four episodes were packaged as a two-hour movie . Avatar : The Last Airbender is notable for borrowing extensively from East Asian art and mythology to create its universe . The series ' character designs are heavily influenced by Chinese art , history , Hinduism , Taoism and Buddhism , and Yoga . Traditional Chinese calligraphy styles represent nearly all the writing in the series . For each instance of calligraphy , an appropriate style is used , ranging from seal script ( more archaic ) to clerical script . The show employed a cultural consultant , Edwin Zane , and calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee as consultants for the series ' cultural influences . The choreographed martial art bending moves were affected by Asian cinema . In an interview , Bryan revealed that , \" Mike and I were really interested in other epic ' Legends & Lore ' properties , like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings , but we knew that we wanted to take a different approach to that type of genre . Our love for Japanese anime , Hong Kong action and kung fu cinema , yoga , and Eastern philosophies led us to the initial inspiration for Avatar : The Last Airbender . \" All music and sound used in the series was done by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn , who formed The Track Team . They experimented with use of a wide range of different instruments , the guzheng , pipa , and duduk , to compose background music . The term \" Avatar \" comes from Sanskrit ( \u0905\u0935\u0924\u093e\u0930 ) , wherein means \" descent \" ; its roots are ava , \" down , \" and tri , \" to pass \" . In the Hindu scriptures , avatar signifies the mortal incarnation of a god ( usually Vishnu ) . The Chinese characters apparent at the top of the show 's title card mean \" the divine medium who has descended upon the mortal world \" . According to the plot , Aang unknowingly revealed he was the Avatar when by choosing four toys out of thousands , each of which were the childhood toys of previous Avatars . In Tibetan Buddhism , there is a similar test for reincarnations of a Tulku Lama . In Magic and Mystery in Tibet , Alexandra David-Neel writes that \" a number of objects such as rosaries , ritualistic implements , books , tea-cups , etc . , are placed together , and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late tulku , thus showing that he recognizes the things which were theirs in their previous life \" . Each successor is expected to show signs of continuity with the previous Avatar , being born within a week of the death . Avatar : The Last Airbender draws on the four classical elements for its bending arts : Water , Earth , Fire , and Air . Although each has its own variation , most ancient philosophies incorporate these four elements : examples include the classical Hindu , Buddhist , and Greek elemental traditions . In the show 's opening , each element is accompanied by two Chinese characters : an ancient Chinese seal script character on the left representing the element being shown and a modern Chinese character on the right describing some feature of the element . The character \u6c34 ( pinyin : shu\u01d0 ) , which stands for water , is shown with \u5584 ( pinyin : sh\u00e0n ) , which means good and benevolent . The character \u571f ( pinyin : t\u01d4 ) , which stands for earth , is shown with \u5f37 ( pinyin : qi\u00e1ng ) , which means strong and powerful . The character \u706b ( pinyin : hu\u01d2 ) , which stands for fire , is shown with \u70c8 ( pinyin : li\u00e8 ) , which means intense and fierce .

In addition to the use of four classical elements in the series , the fighting styles associated with each element are derived from different styles of Chinese martial arts , for which the film-makers employed Sifu Kisu of the Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association as a consultant . Each fighting style was chosen to represent the element it projected . T 'ai chi was used for \" Waterbending \" in the series , which focuses on alignment , body structure , breath , and visualization . Hung Gar was used for \" Earthbending \" in the series , and was chosen for its firmly rooted stances and powerful strikes to present the solid nature of earth . Northern Shaolin , which uses strong arm and leg movements was used to represent \" Firebending \" .

Mattel came to release information stating that they have taken account of Katara 's increased role within the program , and that she would be included in the figure assortment for a mid-2007 release . The figure ultimately went unreleased , however , as the entire line was canceled before she could be produced .

Night Shyamalan . It was intended as the first movie of a trilogy , with each of the three films to be based upon one of the three television seasons , but the film 's reception was overwhelmingly negative from both critics and series fans alike , earning it a 6 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes and five Razzies in 31st Golden Raspberry Awards of 2011 , including Worst Picture . The film originally shared the title of the television series , but it was changed to simply The Last Airbender because producers feared it would be confused with the James Cameron film Avatar .

It is written and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko , the creators and producers of the original series . Initially titled Avatar : Legend of Korra , then The Last Airbender : Legend of Korra , it takes place seventy years after the end of Avatar : The Last Airbender . The first season of 12 episodes aired from April to June 2012 , and a second season of 14 episodes aired from September 2013 to November 2013 ; a third season of 13 episodes aired from June 2014 to August 2014 , and a fourth and final season of 13 episodes aired from October 2014 to December 2014 . The series ' protagonist is Korra , a 17-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the reincarnation of the Avatar after Aang 's death . The character was partly inspired by Avatar Kyoshi of the original series , whom the creators say was popular among fans . To avoid repetition of Aang 's adventures during the original series , the creators wanted to root the show in one place : Republic City . A concept drawing of the city , released with the announcement of the series , shows the city 's design as inspired by Shanghai , Hong Kong , Manhattan , and Vancouver with a steampunk vibe . In the show 's first season , Korra has to learn airbending from Tenzin , the youngest son of Aang and Katara , and contend with Amon 's anti-bender revolution taking place in the city . The show 's second season also provides the origins of the Avatar Cycle .",

                    "text": "Aladdin ( 1992 Disney film ) = Aladdin is a 1992 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Aladdin is the 31st animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series , and was part of the Disney film era known as the Disney Renaissance . The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements , and is based on the Arab-style folktale Aladdin and the Magic Lamp from One Thousand and One Nights . The voice cast features Scott Weinger , Robin Williams , Linda Larkin , Jonathan Freeman , Frank Welker , Gilbert Gottfried , and Douglas Seale . Lyricist Howard Ashman first pitched the idea , and the screenplay went through three drafts before then-Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg agreed to its production . The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld , and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements . The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice , who took over after Ashman 's death . Aladdin was released on November 25 , 1992 and was the most successful film of 1992 , earning over $ 217 million in revenue in the United States , and over $ 504 million worldwide . The film also won many awards , most of them for its soundtrack . The film is considered by many as the best film that came out during the Disney Renaissance . Aladdin 's success led to other material inspired by the film , including two direct-to-video sequels , The Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves , an animated television series of the same name , toys , video games , spin-offs , including a live-action remake about the genie titled Genies , Disney merchandise , and a Broadway adaptation that debuted in 2014 . = = Plot = = A peddler sets up shop in the fictional sultanate of Agrabah , offering to tell the audience about the story of an oil lamp in his possession . Jafar , the Grand Vizier of the Sultan , and his parrot Iago , seek the lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders but is told that only a \u201c diamond in the rough \u201d may enter . Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy . Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine , who has run away from the palace , unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor . Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love , but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended , tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated . Disguised as an old man , Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu , taking them to the Cave and promises to reward them if they retrieve the lamp . Inside , Aladdin befriends a magic carpet . Abu greedily tries to steal a jewel , despite the Cave \u2019 s request , and it collapses . Trapped underground , Aladdin rubs the lamp , releasing the Genie trapped inside , who explains Aladdin has become his master and will grant him three wishes . Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the Cave without wasting a wish , and then uses his first to become a prince to be near Jasmine . Jafar , on Iago \u2019 s suggestion , plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine , but Aladdin parades into the city as \u201c Prince Ali of Ababwa \u201d . However , Jasmine is unimpressed with Aladdin \u2019 s bravado . Despite his friends advising him to tell Jasmine the truth , Aladdin refuses , believing she would never fall \u201c for some street rat \u201d . He takes Jasmine on a worldwide flight on the carpet , where she deduces his identity , though Aladdin says that he dresses as a peasant to escape the stresses of royal life , which convinces her . Aladdin returns Jasmine home , only to be attacked by the palace guards on Jafar \u2019 s orders and nearly drowned , until the Genie rescues him using his second wish . Jafar tries to hypnotise the Sultan into agreeing to his marriage to Jasmine , only for Aladdin to appear and expose Jafar \u2019 s schemes . Jafar flees , but notices Aladdin has the lamp , realising who he is . Learning he will become Sultan , Aladdin has second thoughts about freeing the Genie , believing that without him , he would not be able to keep up appearances . Iago steals the lamp , and Jafar becomes the Genie \u2019 s new master . He uses his first two wishes to usurp the Sultan and become the world \u2019 s most powerful sorcerer , exposing Aladdin \u2019 s lies and exiles him , Abu , and the carpet to a frozen wasteland , though they escape death and return to the palace . Jafar orders the Genie to brainwash Jasmine into falling in love with him , but the Genie reveals he is unable to grant the wish . Jasmine feigns interest to distract Jafar and allow Aladdin to get the lamp , but he is caught . Jafar transforms himself into a giant cobra and ensnares Aladdin , saying he is the most powerful being in the world . However , Aladdin points out the Genie is more powerful , inspiring Jafar to use his last wish to become a genie , only to be sucked into his own lamp as part of the genie \u2019 s nature , dragging Iago in with him . The Genie chucks Jafar \u2019 s lamp into the Cave of Wonders , and asks Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title . However , Aladdin decides to free the Genie . Learning of Aladdin and Jasmine \u2019 s love , the Sultan alters the law to allow his daughter to marry whom she chooses . The Genie leaves to explore the world , while Aladdin and Jasmine celebrate their engagement . = = Cast = = Scott Weinger as Aladdin , a poor , but kind-hearted Agrabah thief . Weinger sent in a homemade audition tape with his mother playing the Genie , and after several call backs he found six months later that he had the part . Aladdin 's supervising animator was by Glen Keane . Brad Kane provides Aladdin 's singing voice . Robin Williams as The Genie , a comedic genie , with nigh omnipotent power that can only be exercised when his master wishes it . The Genie 's supervising animator was Eric Goldberg . Clements and Musker wrote the part of the Genie for Williams , and , when met with resistance , created a reel of Williams ' stand-up to animation of the Genie . The directors asked Goldberg to animate a Genie over one of Williams ' old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor . The resulting test , where Williams talking about schizophrenia was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself , made Williams \" laugh his ass off \" and convinced him to sign on for the role . Williams ' appearance in Aladdin ( despite his appearance along with Christian Slater and Tim Curry in the early 1992 animated film FernGully ) marks the beginning of a transition in animated film to celebrity voice actors , rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated film . Williams provided many celebrity impressions during recording sessions , which were re-adapted into the fabric of the character . These included Ed Sullivan , Jack Nicholson , Robert De Niro , Groucho Marx , Rodney Dangerfield , William F. Buckley , Peter Lorre , Arnold Schwarzenegger , and Arsenio Hall . Williams also voices the Peddler , a mysterious merchant who appears at the beginning of the film . After promoting useless goods to the audience , he reveals the magic lamp and begins the story of Aladdin . Bruce Adler supplies his singing voice . The scene was completely unscripted \u2014 the production left Williams a table with props covered with a sheet and asked him to pull out objects without looking at them and describe them in-character . The double role originally led to the Peddler revealing to be the Genie disguised , but that idea was later dropped . In October 2015 , Clements and Musker claimed that the Peddler is actually the Genie 's human form . Jonathan Freeman as Jafar , the power-hungry Grand Vizier of Agrabah . Jafar was originally envisioned as an irritable character , but the directors decided that a calm villain would be scarier . Freeman was the first actor cast and spent one year and nine months recording his dialogue . He later readjusted his voice after Weinger and Larkin were cast as he felt \" Jafar had to be seen as a real threat to Aladdin and Jasmine \" . Jafar 's supervising animator was Andreas Deja , who tried to incorporate Freeman 's facial expressions and gesturing into the character , while Jafar 's beggar and snake forms are animated by Kathy Zielinski . Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine : The princess of Agrabah , who is tired of life in the royal palace . Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition , and had to adjust ( or lower ) her high-pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for in the character . Jasmine 's supervising animator was Mark Henn . Lea Salonga provides Jasmine 's singing voice . Frank Welker as Abu , Aladdin 's kleptomaniac pet monkey with a high-pitched voice . The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study their movements for Abu 's character . In the three years it took to record the film , Welker did not meet Weinger or Williams . Welker also voices Jasmine 's tiger Rajah and the Cave of Wonders . Duncan Marjoribanks was the supervising animator for Abu , while Rajah was animated by Aaron Blaise . Gilbert Gottfried as Iago , Jafar 's sarcastic , foul-mouthed parrot assistant . Iago 's supervising animator Will Finn tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried 's appearance into Iago 's design , especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth . Douglas Seale as The Sultan , the pompous , but kind ruler of Agrabah , who desperately tries to find a suitor for his daughter Jasmine . Some aspects of the character were inspired by the Wizard of Oz , to create a bumbling authority figure . The Sultan 's supervising animator was David Pruiksma . Jim Cummings as Razoul , the Captain of the Guard . He was named after layout supervisor Rasoul Azadani . He and the other guards were animated by Phil Young and Chris Wahl . Charlie Adler as Gazeem : A thief that Jafar sends into the Cave of Wonders at the beginning of the film but is trapped inside for being unworthy . Gazeem was animated by T. Daniel Hofstedt . Corey Burton as Prince Achmed , a snobbish prince who is rejected by Princess Jasmine as her suitor . = = Production = = = = = Script and development = = = In 1988 , lyricist Howard Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of Aladdin . Ashman had written a 40-page film treatment remaining faithful to the plot and characters of the original story , but envisioned as a campy 1930s-style musical with a Cab Calloway / Fats Waller-like Genie . Along with partner Alan Menken , Ashman conceived several songs and added Aladdin 's friends named Babkak , Omar , and Kasim to the story . However , the studio were dismissive of Ashman 's treatment and removed the project from development in which Ashman and Menken were later recruited to compose songs for Beauty and the Beast . Linda Woolverton , who had also worked on Beauty and the Beast , used their treatment and developed a draft with inspired elements from The Thief of Bagdad such as a villain named Jaf 'far , an aged sidekick retired human thief named Abu , and a human handmaiden for the princess . Then , directors John Musker and Ron Clements joined the production , picking Aladdin out of three projects offered , which also included an adaptation of Swan Lake and King of the Jungle \u2013 that eventually became The Lion King . Before Ashman 's death in March 1991 , Ashman and Menken had composed \" Prince Ali \" and his last song , \" Humiliate the Boy \" . Musker and Clements wrote a draft of the screenplay , and then delivered a story reel to studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg in April 1991 . Katzenberg thought the script \" didn 't engage \" , and on a day known by the staff as \" Black Friday , \" demanded that the entire story to be rewritten without rescheduling the film 's November 25 , 1992 release date . Among the changes Katzenberg requested from Clements and Musker were to not be dependent on Ashman 's vision , and the removal of Aladdin 's mother , remarking , \" Eighty-six the mother . The mom 's a zero . \" Screenwriting duo Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were brought in to rework the story , and the changes they made included the removal of Aladdin 's mother , the strengthening of the character of Princess Jasmine , and the deletion of several of the Ashman-Menken songs . Aladdin 's personality was rewritten to be \" a little rougher , like a young Harrison Ford , \" and the parrot Iago , originally conceived as an uptight British archetype , was reworked into a comic role after the filmmakers saw Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II . Gottfried was cast to provide Iago 's voice . By October 1991 , Katzenberg was satisfied with the new version of Aladdin . As with Woolverton 's screenplay , several characters and plot elements are based on the 1940 version of The Thief of Bagdad , the location of the film was changed from Baghdad , Iraq to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah . = = = Design and animation = = = One of the first issues that the animators faced during production of Aladdin was the depiction of Aladdin himself . Director and producer John Musker explains : He was initially going to be as young as 13 , but that eventually changed to eighteen . Aladdin was designed by a team led by supervising animator Glen Keane , and was originally made to resemble actor Michael J. Fox . During production , it was decided that the design was too boyish and wasn 't \" appealing enough , \" so the character was redesigned to add elements derived from actor Tom Cruise and Calvin Klein models . The design for most characters was based on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld , which production designer Richard Vander Wende also considered appropriate to the theme , due to similarities to the swooping lines of Persian miniatures and Arabic calligraphy . Jafar 's design was not based on Hirschfeld 's work because Jafar 's supervising animator , Andreas Deja , wanted the character to be contrasting . Each character was animated alone , with the animators consulting each other to make scenes with interrelating characters . Since Aladdin 's animator Glen Keane was working in the California branch of Walt Disney Feature Animation , and Jasmine 's animator Mark Henn was in the Florida one at Disney-MGM Studios , they had to frequently phone , fax or send designs and discs to each other . The Magic Carpet is a sentient carpet who is able to fly . Animator Randy Cartwright described working on the Carpet as challenging , since it is only a rectangular shape , who expresses himself through pantomime \u2013 \" It 's sort of like acting by origami \" . Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet . After the character animation was done , the carpet 's surface design was applied digitally . For the scenery design , layout supervisor Rasoul Azadani took many pictures of his hometown of Isfahan , Iran for guidance . Other inspirations for design were Disney 's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad . The coloring was done with the computerized CAPS process , and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality \u2013 the protagonists use light colors such as blue , the antagonists darker ones such as red and black , and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow . Computer animation was used for some elements of the film , such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave . Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind ; even though Katzenberg suggested actors such as John Candy , Steve Martin , and Eddie Murphy , Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role . Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks in the shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time , Hook and Toys . Unusually for an animated film , much of Williams ' dialogue was ad-libbed : for some scenes , Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions , but allowed to improvise his lines . It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters . Eric Goldberg , the supervising animator for the Genie , then reviewed Williams ' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match . The producers added many in-jokes and references to Disney 's previous works in the film , such as a \" cameo appearance \" from directors Clements and Musker and drawing some characters based on Disney workers . Beast , Sebastian from The Little Mermaid , and Pinocchio make brief appearances , and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film \u2014 Goofy hat , Hawaiian shirt , and sandals \u2014 are a reference to a short film that Robin Williams did for the Disney-MGM Studios tour in the late 1980s . = = = Robin Williams ' conflicts with the studio = = = In gratitude for his success with Touchstone Pictures ' Good Morning , Vietnam , Robin Williams voiced the Genie for SAG scale pay ( $ 75,000 ) , on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing , and his ( supporting ) character not take more than 25 % of space on advertising artwork , since Williams ' film Toys was scheduled for release one month after Aladdin 's debut . For financial reasons , the studio went back on the deal on both counts , especially in poster art by having the Genie in 25 % of the image , but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller . The Disney Hyperion book Aladdin : The Making of an Animated Film listed both of Williams ' characters \" The Peddler \" and \" The Genie \" ahead of main characters , but was forced to refer to him only as \" the actor signed to play the Genie \" . = = = Music = = = Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is \" consistently good , rivaling the best of Disney 's other animated musicals from the ' 90s . \" Menken and Ashman began work on the film together , with Rice taking over as lyricist after Ashman died of AIDS-related complications in early 1991 . Although fourteen songs were written for Aladdin , only six are featured in the movie , three by each lyricist . The DVD Special Edition released in 2004 includes four songs in early animations tests , and a music video of one , \" Proud of Your Boy \" , performed by Clay Aiken , which also appears on the album DisneyMania 3 . = = Themes = = The filmmakers thought the moral message of the original tale was not appropriate , and decided to \" put a spin on it \" , by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great thing , but eventually becoming a problem . Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not \u2013 both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble faking to be different people , and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine , who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is . Being \" imprisoned \" is also discussed , a fate that occurs to most of the characters \u2013 Aladdin and Jasmine are stuck to their lifestyles , Genie is attached to his lamp and Jafar , to the Sultan \u2013 and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace , and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees . Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess , being rebellious to the royal life and the social structure , and trying to make her own way , unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue . = = Release and reception = = = = = Theatrical run = = = A large promotion campaign preceded Aladdin 's debut in theaters , with the film 's trailer being attached to most Disney VHS releases , and numerous tie-ins and licensees being released . After a limited release on November 13 , 1992 , Aladdin debuted in 1,131 theaters on November 25 , 1992 , grossing $ 19.2 million in its opening weekend \u2013 number two at the box office , behind Home Alone 2 : Lost in New York . It took eight weeks for the film to reach number one at the US box office , breaking the record for the week between Christmas and New Year 's Eve with $ 32.2 million . The film held the top spot five times during its 22-week run . Aladdin was the most successful film of 1992 grossing $ 217 million in the United States and over $ 504 million worldwide . It was the biggest gross for an animated film until The Lion King two years later . As of January 2014 , it is the thirtieth highest grossing animated film and the third highest grossing traditionally animated feature worldwide , behind The Lion King and The Simpsons Movie .

Most critics ' praise went to Robin Williams ' performance as Genie , with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children \" needn 't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is \" . Warner Bros. Cartoons director Chuck Jones even called the film \" the funniest feature ever made . \" Furthermore , English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered it to be the greatest film of all time . James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars , praising the \" crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers \" . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults , a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post , who also said \" kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure . \" Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters , describing the expressive magic carpet as \" its most remarkable accomplishment \" and considered that \" Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity \" . Some aspects of the film were widely criticized . Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wrote a negative review , describing the film as racist , ridiculous , and a \" narcissistic circus act \" from Robin Williams . Roger Ebert , who generally praised the film in his review , considered the music inferior to its predecessors The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast , and claimed Aladdin and Jasmine were \" pale and routine \" . = = = Awards = = = Aladdin also received many award nominations , mostly for its music . It won two Academy Awards , Best Music , Original Score and Best Music , Original Song for \" A Whole New World \" and receiving nominations for Best Song ( \" Friend Like Me \" ) , Best Sound Editing ( Mark A.

In its first week of availability , Aladdin sold over 10.6 million copies , and went on to sell over 25 million in total ( a record only broken by the later release of The Lion King ) . It entered moratorium on April 30 , 1994 . On October 5 , 2004 , Aladdin was released on DVD , as part of Disney 's Platinum Edition line . The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation , prepared for Aladdin 's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003 , and a second disc with bonus features . Accompanied by a $ 19 million marketing campaign , the DVD sold about 3 million units in its first month , but it was less than the number of copies , sold in that amount of time , by any other Platinum Edition released before it . The film 's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix . The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008 , along with its sequels . According to an insert in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case , Aladdin was going to be released on Blu-ray Disc as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013 . Instead , Peter Pan was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition on February 5 , 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary . A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013 . The Belgian edition ( released without advertisements , commercials or any kind of fanfare ) comes as a 1-disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD ) . The same disc was released in the United Kingdom on April 14 , 2013 . Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a Diamond Edition Blu-ray on October 13 , 2015 . The film was released on Digital HD on September 29 , 2015 . Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S. , the film topped the Blu-ray Disc sales chart and debuted at number 2 at the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart , which tracks overall disc sales behind the disaster film San Andreas . = = = Controversies = = = One of the verses of the opening song \" Arabian Nights \" was altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee ( ADC ) . The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from \" Where they cut off your ear if they don 't like your face , \" in the original release to \" Where it 's flat and immense and the heat is intense . \" The change first appeared on the 1993 video release . The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release , but the re-release uses the edited lyric . The rerecording has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line . The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line . Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in a list of the most controversial films in history , due to this incident . The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine . They criticized the characters ' Anglicized features and Anglo-American accents , in contrast to the other characters in the film , which are dark-skinned , have foreign accents and grotesque facial features , and appear villainous or greedy . Protests were also raised to another scene . When Aladdin is attacked by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony , Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported hearing as \" Good teenagers , take off your clothes , \" which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity . However , according to the director 's commentary on the 2004 DVD , while Musker and Clements did admit Scott Weinger ad-libbed during the scene , they claimed \" we did not record that , we would not record that . \" and said the line was \" Good tiger , take off and go ... \" and the word \" tiger \" is overlapped by Rajah 's snarl . After the word tiger , a second voice can be heard which has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack . Because of the controversy , Disney removed the line on the DVD release . Animation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams ' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler ( also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International ) . These similarities include a similar plot , similar characters , scenes and background designs , and the antagonist Zig-Zag 's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar . Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler , The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s , its production being mired in difficulties including financial problems , copyright issues , and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work . The late release , coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film , has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a copy of Aladdin . = = Live-action prequel = = On July 15 , 2015 , the studio started developing a live-action comedy adventure prequel called Genies that is being written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift , while Tripp Vinson is on board to produce via his Vinson Films banner . The film is planned to lead for a live-action Aladdin movie . On November 8 , Disney revealed it had originally planned to use Robin Williams ' unused lines from the 1991 \u2013 2 recording sessions for the film , but his will prohibited the studio from using his likeness for twenty-five years after his death .",

                    "text": "History of The Simpsons = The Simpsons is an American animated television sitcom starring the animated Simpson family , which was created by Matt Groening . He conceived of the characters in the lobby of James L. Brooks 's office and named them after his own family members , substituting \" Bart \" for his own name . The family debuted as shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 , 1987 . After a three-season run , the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show called The Simpsons , which debuted on December 17 , 1989 . The show was an early hit for Fox , becoming the first Fox series to land in the top 30 ratings in a season ( 1990 ) . The show was controversial from its beginning and has made the news several times . In the early seasons , some parents and conservatives characterized Bart as a poor role model for children and several United States public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts . In January 1992 , then-President George H. W. Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign in which he said : \" We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family , to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons . \" In 2002 , the show was nearly sued by the Rio de Janeiro tourist board for creating an unreal image of the city on the show . The Simpsons Movie , a feature-length film , was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27 , 2007 . Previous attempts to create a film version of The Simpsons failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members . Eventually , producers Brooks , Groening , Al Jean , Mike Scully , and Richard Sakai began development of the film in 2001 . They conceived numerous plot ideas , with Groening 's being the one developed into a film . The script was re-written over a hundred times , and this creativity continued after animation had begun in 2006 . The film was a box office success , and received overwhelmingly positive reviews . The Simpsons eventually became the longest-running American sitcom , the longest-running American animated program , and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American primetime , scripted television series . Since its debut on December 17 , 1989 , the show has broadcast 596 episodes and its 27th season started airing on September 27 , 2015 . = = The Tracey Ullman shorts ( 1987 \u2013 1989 ) = = When producer James L. Brooks was working on the television variety show The Tracey Ullman Show for the fledging Fox network , he decided that he wanted to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks . Having seen one of cartoonist Matt Groening 's Life in Hell comic strips , Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts , which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series . Groening later realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life 's work , and passed on the offer . Richard Sakai contacted Groening to see if he had any other characters he would be willing to let Fox merchandise , and , in short , Groening developed a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons . Garth Ancier contends that Groening created the characters at home and brought them the next day , while Phil Roman claims Groening sketched out the characters on the drive to Fox . Groening 's account states he hurriedly formulated The Simpsons while waiting in the lobby of Brooks 's office for the pitch meeting , which is the most common and famous story . He named the characters after his own family members , substituting \" Bart \" for his own name , adapting an anagram of the word \" brat \" . Fox negotiated a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening , in which he retained a large portion of revenue from merchandising . To animate the short segments , Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo , a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons for cheap . Brooks initially just wanted to animate the shorts through the basic line drawings , and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost . The studio only employed three young animators \u2014 CalArts graduates Bill Kopp , Wes Archer , and David Silverman \u2014 who adapted Groening 's scripts for animation in one week , doing layouts , animation and inbetweening by hand in the very short amount of time . Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three , and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production . However , the animators merely re-traced his drawings , which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes . Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow . Appearing initially alongside cartoons by M. K. Brown , The Simpson family first appeared in short subjects in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 , 1987 and were featured the first three seasons . The actors who voiced the characters would later reprise their roles in The Simpsons . Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson , Abraham Simpson , and Krusty the Clown . Homer 's voice in the shorts is a loose impression of Walter Matthau , whereas it became more robust and humorous on the half-hour show , allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions . Julie Kavner , Nancy Cartwright , and Yeardley Smith performed the voices of Marge Simpson , Bart Simpson , and Lisa Simpson respectively . The crew began to string the clips together on tape to play for the show 's live audience , and The Simpsons generated \" the biggest laughs of the show \" according to John Ortved , author of The Simpsons : An Uncensored , Unauthorized History . The writing staff of Ullman soon began to view The Simpsons as poor relations due to the popularity , and Brooks began to consider adapting the shorts for its own half-hour series . Brooks ' decision was partly inspired by the cheerleading of David Silverman , who drunkenly approached him at a Christmas party and suggested the idea , passionately emphasizing what a primetime series would mean for the animation industry . = = The Groening , Brooks , and Simon years ( 1989 \u2013 1991 ) = = In 1989 , a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company . The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house . Due to the increased workload of the full-length episodes , production was subcontracted to South Korean animation studio AKOM . While character and background layout is done by the domestic studio , tweening , coloring and filming is done by the overseas studio . The Simpsons was co-developed by Groening , Brooks , and Sam Simon , a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects . Groening said his goal was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called \" the mainstream trash \" . Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show 's content . Fox network was unsure if the show could sustain the audience 's attention for the duration of the episode . They proposed doing three seven-minute shorts per episode and four specials until the audience adjusted , but in the end , the producers gambled by asking Fox for 13 full-length episodes . Simon assembled and led the initial team of writers , and has been credited as \" developing [ the show 's ] sensibility \" . Writer Ken Levine says he \" brought a level of honesty to the characters \" and made them \" three-dimensional \" , adding that Simon 's \" comedy is all about character , not just a string of gags \" . Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve what he did not like about Saturday-morning cartoon shows . He wanted all the actors in a room together , instead of reading their lines separated from each other . In addition to Castellaneta , Kavner , Cartwright and Smith , actors Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria were added to the show 's cast . Groening developed a lengthy opening sequence in order to cut down on the animation necessary for each episode , but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week . In the first gag , the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School , where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard . This message , which changes from episode to episode , has become known as the \" chalkboard gag \" . The other gag is known as a \" couch gag \" , in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television . Groening , who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood , was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time . The theme , which plays over the sequence , was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989 , after Groening approached him requesting a retro-style theme . The piece , which took two days to create , has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career . The half-hour series premiered on December 17 , 1989 with \" Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire \" . The series was originally set to debut in the fall of 1989 with the episode \" Some Enchanted Evening \" , but the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70 percent of the episode needed to be redone . At the time there were only a few choices for animation style . Usually , they would either follow the style of Disney , Warner Bros. , or Hanna-Barbera . The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world . They considered aborting the series if the next episode \" Bart the Genius \" turned out as bad , but it only suffered from easily fixable problems . The debut was moved to December , and \" Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire \" became the first episode of the series . In some of the episodes of the first season , the characters act completely differently from in later seasons ; Lisa , for example , is undisciplined and short-tempered , while Homer is the voice of reason ; these roles are reversed in later episodes . During the second season , The Simpsons aired the first Halloween special called \" Treehouse of Horror \" . The annual series typically consist of four parts : an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits , followed by three segments . These segments usually have a horror , science fiction or supernatural theme and quite often are parodies of films , novels , plays , television shows , Twilight Zone episodes , or old issues of EC Comics . Part of the attraction for the writers is that they are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode . In some cases , the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode , but can be used as a segment in the seasonal special . The first \" Treehouse of Horror \" episode was the first time that an alternate version of the theme airs over the end credits . = = = Bartmania and criticism from conservatives = = = The show was controversial from its beginning . The rebellious lead character at the time , Bart , frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior , which led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children . Several US public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts , such as one featuring Bart and the caption \" Underachiever ( ' And proud of it , man ! ' ) \" . In the season two opening episode \" Bart Gets an F \" , Bart fails four consecutive history exams and the school psychiatrist recommends that Bart repeat the fourth grade . Several critics thought that the episode \" Bart Gets an F \" was a response to these controversies . However , Brooks denied that it was a response and added , \" we 're mindful of it . I do think it 's important for us that Bart does badly in school . There are students like that . Besides , I 'm very wary of television where everybody is supposed to be a role model . You don 't run across that many role models in real life . Why should television be full of them ? \" In the October 1 , 1990 edition of People , First Lady Barbara Bush called The Simpsons \" the dumbest thing [ she ] had ever seen \" which led to the writers sending a letter to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson . Bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized . A few years later , on January 27 , 1992 then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign where he said , \" We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family , to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons . \" The writers decided that they wanted to respond by adding a response to the next broadcast of The Simpsons , which was a rerun of \" Stark Raving Dad \" on January 30 . The broadcast included a new tongue-in-cheek opening where they watch Bush 's speech . Bart replies , \" Hey , we 're just like the Waltons . We 're praying for an end to the Depression , too \" . The criticism eventually led to the idea for the episode \" Two Bad Neighbors \" , which has George and Barbara move into the house across the street from the Simpsons . = = = Competing with The Cosby Show = = = The Simpsons first season was the Fox network 's first TV series to rank among a season 's top 30 highest-rated shows . Due to its success , the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons timeslots in hopes that it would result in higher ratings for the lead out shows . It would move from 8 : 00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show , the number one show at the time . Many of the producers were against the move , as The Simpsons had been in the top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings . \" Bart Gets an F \" was the first episode to air against The Cosby Show and averaged an 18.4 Nielsen rating and 29 % of the audience . In the weeks ratings , it finished tied for eighth behind The Cosby Show which had an 18.5 rating . However , an estimated 33.6 million viewers watched the episode , making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week . At the time , it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network . Ratings wise , new episodes of The Cosby Show beat The Simpsons every time during the second season and The Simpsons eventually fell out of the top 10 . At the end of the season Cosby averaged as the fifth highest rated show on television while The Simpsons ranked 38th . It would not be until the third season episode \" Homer at the Bat \" that The Simpsons would beat The Cosby Show in the ratings . The show remained in its Thursday timeslot until the sixth season , when it moved back to its original timeslot on Sundays . = = = Music release and \" Do the Bartman \" = = = David Geffen , founder of Geffen Records , had the idea to record the album The Simpsons Sing the Blues based on The Simpsons , to be released in time for Christmas 1990 . The writers wrote humorous lyrics for the actors to perform over blues and hip hop . The album faced great publicity before its release . One particular element that was highly publicized was Michael Jackson 's involvement , which was denied around the time of the album 's release . Early published reports attributed Jackson as the composer of \" Do the Bartman \" , which Groening denied in a press release . However , Groening revealed in 1998 that \" Do the Bartman \" was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson , but he could not receive credit for it because he was under contract to another record label . Jackson was a fan of The Simpsons , especially Bart , and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number one single and do a guest spot on the show , which is how \" Do the Bartman \" came about . Jackson eventually guest-starred in the episode \" Stark Raving Dad \" . The album The Simpsons Sing the Blues peaked at # 3 on the Billboard 200 , making it the highest charting Simpsons album . On February 13 , 1991 , the record was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 3 million copies . The producers followed up on the album with The Yellow Album in 1998 , which featured original recordings by Prince , Linda Ronstadt , C + C Music Factory , and George Clinton of Funkadelic as well as the cast of The Simpsons . The soundtrack albums Songs in the Key of Springfield ( 1997 ) , Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons ( 1999 ) , The Simpsons Movie : The Music ( 2007 ) , and The Simpsons : Testify ( 2007 ) were also released . = = The Jean and Reiss years ( 1991 \u2013 1993 ) = = Although they initially worked well together , Simon and Groening 's relationship became \" very contentious \" according to Groening . According to John Ortved 's book The Simpsons : An Uncensored , Unauthorized History , Simon resented the media attention Groening received , particularly the praise for the show 's writing ; Simon felt that Groening 's involvement was limited , and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show . As well as Groening , Simon was often at odds with Brooks and production company Gracie Films and left the show in 1993 . Before leaving , he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the show 's profits every year , and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since . Al Jean and Mike Reiss , who had written for The Simpsons since the start of the show , took over as showrunners for the third season . Compared to being an executive producer , the showrunner position is more involved with the show and acts as head writer and manages the show 's production for an entire season . As well as a turnover in the staff , The Simpsons moved the production of the animation from Klasky Csupo to Film Roman in season four . During the fourth season the episode \" A Streetcar Named Marge \" was produced . The musical within the episode contains a controversial song about New Orleans , which describes the city as a \" home of pirates , drunks and whores \" , among other things . Jeff Martin , the writer of the episode , had meant the song to be a parody of the opening number in Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street , which speaks of London in unflattering terms . A New Orleans critic viewed \" A Streetcar Named Marge \" and published the song lyrics in his newspaper before the episode aired . Many readers took the lyrics out of context , and New Orleans ' Fox affiliate , WNOL , received about one hundred complaints on the day the episode aired . Several local radio stations also held on-air protests in response to the song . The Simpsons ' producers rushed out an apologetic chalkboard gag for \" Homer the Heretic \" , which aired a week after \" A Streetcar Named Marge \" . It read , \" I will not defame New Orleans \" . Ullman filed a lawsuit in 1992 , claiming that her show was the source of The Simpsons ' success and therefore should receive a share of the show 's profit . \" I breast-fed those little devils , \" Ullman once said of The Simpsons . She wanted a share of The Simpsons ' merchandising and gross profits and believed she was entitled to $ 2.5 million of Fox 's estimated $ 50 million in 1992 . The Fox network had paid her $ 58,000 in royalties for The Simpsons as well as $ 3 million for the 3 \u00bd seasons her show was on the air . Eventually the courts ruled in favor of the network . = = The Mirkin years ( 1993 \u2013 1995 ) = = Several of the show 's original writers who had worked on The Simpsons since the first season had left following the completion of season four . David Mirkin took over as showrunner and executive producer for the fifth and sixth season . In The Simpsons : An Uncensored , Unauthorized History ( 2009 ) , John Ortved describes Mirkin as an \" outsider \" on the show as , unlike the bulk of the writing staff , Mirkin was not a Harvard University graduate . The writing staff were , at least initially , divided on Mirkin 's abilities as a leader . Mirkin conducted the show 's writing sessions in one room , rather than splitting the writers into two groups as other showrunners had done , and often worked late into the night . Writer Richard Appel praised Mirkin 's leadership and comedy style , saying that \" the shows were great under him . \" In contrast to much of Ortved 's account , in a 2004 interview with Animation Magazine , Mirkin stated that he \" really wasn 't at all intimidat [ ed ] to join [ the show 's writing ] crew , \" because he \" had worked with and written with \" many of his fellow writers previously . Mirkin said that he \" brought [ the show ] back to a more story-oriented \" approach and increased the character and emotion focus , while \" at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird \" . During his tenure , Mirkin moved the show 's focus towards Homer , and developed some of the secondary characters , such as Apu . He also strongly opposed censorship and network interference . Mirkin 's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show 's fans , but the writing staff were divided on his style of humor , which saw the show move away from more \" realistic \" emotional and character based stories to \" pure comedy \" and \" surreal \" humor . The episode \" Deep Space Homer \" was controversial when the episode was in production . Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too \" large \" of an idea and Groening felt that the idea was so big that it gave the writers \" nowhere to go \" . The writing staff wanted to do an episode where the Simpsons family traveled to Australia . They had previously poked fun at several American institutions and thought it would be interesting to poke fun at a whole nation . They designed Australia and the Australian people very inaccurately and many things were completely made up for fun . The episode \" Bart vs. Australia \" received a mixed reception in Australia , with some Australian fans saying the episode was a mockery of their country . Shortly after it had aired , the Simpsons staff received over 100 letters from Australians who were insulted by the episode . Reiss claimed that this episode is Australia 's least favorite , and that \" whenever we have the Simpsons visit another country , that country gets furious , including Australia \" . He also claimed that they were \" condemned in the Australian Parliament after the episode had aired \" . Former showrunners Jean and Reiss had left to produce their own series , The Critic , along with The Simpsons co-creator Brooks . The Critic was a short-lived animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman . For the second season of The Critic , Brooks cut a deal with the Fox network to have the series switch over . The episode \" A Star Is Burns \" was pitched by Brooks , who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox , and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would be a good way to introduce Sherman . In addition , Jean and Reiss returned to produce two episodes ( \" A Star is Burns \" and \" ' Round Springfield \" ) with the staff of The Critic , to relieve some of the stress on The Simpsons ' writing staff . Groening felt that the crossover was a thirty-minute advertisement for another show and blamed Brooks , calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows . After unsuccessful attempts to get the episode pulled , he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired and had his name removed from the credits . In response , Brooks said , \" for years , Al [ Jean ] and Mike [ Reiss ] were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show , staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right . The point is , Matt 's name has been on Mike 's and Al 's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work . In fact , he is the direct beneficiary of their work . ' The Critic ' is their shot and he should be giving them his support . \" Groening conceived the idea of an episode in which the character Mr. Burns was shot , which could be used as a publicity stunt . The writers decided to write the episode \" Who Shot Mr. Burns ? \" in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest . Part one was the final episode of the sixth season and originally aired on the Fox network on May 21 , 1995 . Part two was the premiere of the seventh season and originally aired on September 17 , 1995 . It was important for the writers to design a mystery that had clues , took advantage of freeze frame technology , and was structured around one character who seemed the obvious culprit . In the months following the broadcast of the first part , there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns . Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where the viewers could guess who the culprit was . It ran from August 13 to September 10 and was one of the first contests to tie together elements of television and the internet . Fox launched a new website , www.Springfield.com , devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995 . The winner would be animated on an episode of the show . No one , however , was ever animated on the show . This was because no one officially guessed the right answer , so the chosen winner did not have the right answer and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated . = = The Oakley and Weinstein years ( 1995 \u2013 1997 ) = = After season six , Mirkin suggested that Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein took over as showrunners , but remained on the show in an advisory capacity , helping them with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing , and attending the scripts ' table readings . Oakley and Weinstein wanted to produce Treehouse of Horror episodes , episodes about Sideshow Bob , Itchy & Scratchy and several \" format-bending \" episodes such as \" 22 Short Films About Springfield \" . They aimed for \" at least two episodes per season that ' pushed the envelope ' , [ and ] expanded the definition of what an episode could be . \" Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues , such as divorce , were explored . Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices , and several of their guest stars were \" old grizzled men with distinctive voices \" . Their goal for the episodes was to be realistic and focus more on the five members of the Simpson family and explore their feelings and emotions towards each other . Oakley considered season three to be the single greatest comedic season of television ever produced and so attempted to recreate the feel of that season , focusing on stories with real emotions and situations , as well as some off-the-wall episodes . Season three was their basis for Homer : \" We liked Homer the way he was in the second and third seasons . That was what we consciously used as our model . Dimwitted , loving , hyper-enthusiastic , creatively goofy , parody of the American father \u2013 drawn with real emotions , though admittedly amplified . \" The script supervisor for the show and voice of the character Lunchlady Doris , Doris Grau , died on December 30 , 1995 . The episode \" Team Homer \" , which aired eight days later , was one of the last episodes to feature her voice and featured a dedication to her . From season nine until season eighteen , Lunchlady Doris appeared only as a background character . She returned as a speaking character in several episodes since \" The Mook , the Chef , the Wife and Her Homer \" , and is now voiced by Tress MacNeille . The episode \" Lisa the Vegetarian \" featured a permanent character development when Lisa becomes a vegetarian . The story had been pitched by David S. Cohen and the producers felt it would be a surefire way to get Paul McCartney to guest star . McCartney agreed , but only on the condition that Lisa would stay a vegetarian and not revert . The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show . In the season 13 episode \" She of Little Faith \" , Lisa underwent another permanent character change when she converted to Buddhism . On February 9 , 1997 , The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones with the episode \" The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show \" as the longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States . The producers took this milestone and made the episode deal with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show \" fresh \" again ; themes commonly known as \" jumping the shark \" . Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger , in a review printed two days after the episode originally aired , praised the writers for not airing a \" very special \" episode to celebrate the milestone of overtaking The Flintstones . He noted \" [ the episode is ] so self-aware it put the best in-jokes on St. Elsewhere to shame . \" = = The Scully years ( 1997 \u2013 2001 ) = = Oakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight because they \" didn 't want to break [ the show ] \" and Mike Scully took over as showrunner in 1997 . As showrunner and executive producer , Scully said his aim was to \" not wreck the show \" , Scully was popular with the staff members , many of whom praised his organization and management skills . Writer Tom Martin said he was \" quite possibly the best boss I 've ever worked for \" and \" a great manager of people \" while writer Don Payne commented that for Scully \" it was really important that we kept decent hours \" . Scully noted : \" I wrote a lot of Lisa 's shows . I have five daughters , so I like Lisa a lot . I like Homer , too . Homer comes very naturally to me : I don 't know if that 's a good or a bad thing . A lot of my favorite episodes are the ones when Homer and Lisa are in conflict with each other ... They 're very human , I think that 's their appeal . \" Despite this , Scully 's tenure as showrunner of The Simpsons has been the subject of criticism from the show 's fans . John Ortved wrote \" Scully 's episodes excel when compared to what The Simpsons airs nowadays , but he was the man at the helm when the ship turned towards the iceberg . \" The BBC noted \" the common consensus is that The Simpsons ' golden era ended after season nine \" , while an op-ed in Slate by Chris Suellentrop argued The Simpsons changed from a realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon during Scully 's years . The Simpsons under Scully has been negatively labelled as a \" gag-heavy , Homer-centric incarnation \" by Jon Bonn\u00e9 of MSNBC , while some fans have bemoaned the transformation in Homer 's character during the era , from sweet and sincere to \" a boorish , self-aggrandizing oaf \" , dubbing him \" Jerkass Homer \" . Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully and that he thinks the criticism \" bothered [ Scully ] , and still bothers him , but he managed to not get worked up over it . \" Ortved noted in his book that it is hard to tell how much of the decline is Scully 's fault , and that blaming a single showrunner for lowering the quality of the show \" is unfair . \" UGO Networks ' Brian Tallerico has defended the season against the criticism . He wrote in a 2007 review that comparing \" tenth season Simpsons episodes to the prime of the series ( 3-7 ) is just unfair and really kind of self-defeating . ' Yeah , I laughed , but not as hard as a couple of years ago . So it sucks . ' That 's nonsense . The fact is that even the tenth season of The Simpsons was funnier than most [ other ] show 's best years . \" PopMatters ' Hassenger commented in his review that although the show had declined in quality , \" this is not to say that these episodes are without their charm ; many , in fact , are laugh-out-loud funny and characteristically smart . \" On May 28 , 1998 , Phil Hartman , voice actor of Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz , was shot and killed by his wife while he slept in their Encino , Los Angeles , home . His wife , Brynn Omdahl , then committed suicide several hours later . In the weeks following his death , Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes . Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was \" the last person you 'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy , beloved by everyone he worked with \" . After Hartman 's death in 1998 , rather than replace him with a new voice actor , the production staff retired McClure and Hutz from the show . McClure last appeared in the season ten episode \" Bart the Mother \" , which was dedicated to Hartman . In the season 10 episode \" Thirty Minutes over Tokyo \" , the family travels to Japan . The episode references and mocks several aspects of Japanese and American culture , as well as differences between the two . At a sumo wrestling match , Bart and Homer encounter the Japanese emperor , Akihito . After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs , Bart and Homer are put in jail , where they have to re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin , do origami , flower arranging and meditation . The episode also references the Japanese 's adaption to American culture . Although all other episodes of The Simpsons have been dubbed and broadcast on Japanese television , \" Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo \" has never aired in Japan . The scene , which shows Homer throw the emperor of Japan into a box filled with sumo thongs , was considered disrespectful . = = = Labor difficulties = = = Up until the production of season ten in 1998 , these six main voice actors were paid $ 30,000 per episode . In 1998 , a salary dispute between them and the Fox Broadcasting Company arose , with the actors threatening to strike . Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices , but an agreement was soon made and their salaries were raised to $ 125,000 per episode . Groening expressed his sympathy for the actors in an issue of Mother Jones a while after the salary dispute had been settled . He told the magazine : \" [ The cast members ] are incredibly talented , and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood . \" The show also made a change for the writers to become signatories to the Animation Guild . Most writers in animation belong to the guild , but The Simpsons as well as other animated shows on Fox were different . Scully commented that \" everyone expected a big fight with the studio \" and continued that \" it never materialized , because they conceded that prime-time animation was successful and everyone was benefiting . \" Voice actress Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox . The network originally reported that she decided to quit only because she was tired of flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions . It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise , not only because she was tired of the traveling , but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets . Roswell was paid $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left , and she asked Fox for a raise to $ 6,000 per episode . However , Fox only offered her a $ 150 raise , which did not even cover the travel costs , so she decided to quit . As a result of Roswell 's departure , the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode \" Alone Again , Natura-Diddily \" . Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Roswell 's other characters . Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 in the season premiere of the fourteenth season . She reached a deal with Fox to record her lines from her Denver home and thus the dispute ended . = = The return of Jean ( 2001 \u2013 2007 ) = = Jean returned full-time to The Simpsons during the tenth season . He once again became showrunner with the start of the thirteenth season in 2001 , this time without Reiss . Jean said that \" the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas . People are so on top of things that we 've done before , so the challenge now is to think of an idea that 's good , but hasn 't been seen . \" In April 2001 , in an interview with the The New York Times , Jean stated that he wanted \" to take the show back to the family \" . His return was welcomed , with MSNBC 's Jon Bonn\u00e9 stating : \" [ Jean ] has guided the show away from its gag-heavy , Homer-centric incarnation ... these are certainly brighter days for the show 's long-time fans . \" Bill Gibron of PopMatters.com noted that \" the show corralled much of its craziness for more personal stories \" and that \" Homer \u2019 s Neanderthal nonsense and bratty Bart gave way to ' softer ' episodes focusing on Marge and Lisa . \" In the season 13 episode \" Blame It on Lisa \" , The Simpsons visit Rio de Janeiro in Brazil . In the week following the episode 's original broadcast , it faced intense controversy involving the country of Brazil , most specifically the Rio de Janeiro Tourist Board ( Riotur ) . The board claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime , kidnappings , slums and a rat infestation . The tourist board asserted that the show \" went too far \" and undermined an $ 18m ( \u00a3 12.5m ) advertising campaign to attract visitors to the city . Fernando Henrique Cardoso , then the president of Brazil , stated that the episode \" brought a distorted vision of Brazilian reality . \" By April 9 , Riotur , was preparing to sue the producers and Fox , for damage to its international image and loss of revenue . The issue threatened to become a diplomatic incident . Upon knowledge of an impending lawsuit , the show 's producers contacted Fox lawyers , who informed them that a city could not technically sue for defamation . In response , executive producer Brooks apologized , stating \" we apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro \" . Jean commented that it was \" one of the biggest controversies in the history of the show \" . In season 14 , production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint . The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was \" Radioactive Man \" in 1995 . Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the season 12 episode \" Tennis the Menace \" , but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later . The already completed \" Tennis the Menace \" was broadcast as made . As the show 's revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales , the main cast stopped appearing for script readings in April 2004 . The work stoppage occurred after weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with Fox , in which the cast asked for an increase in their pay to $ 360,000 per episode , or $ 8 million over a 22-episode season . The strike was resolved a month later and their salary was raised to something between $ 250,000 and $ 360,000 per episode . Season 16 featured one of the few major character developments since the show 's inception . It was reported a long time in advance of the airing of the episode \" There 's Something About Marrying \" that a major character would come out as gay during the episode . At the San Diego Comic-Con International convention in July 2004 , Al Jean revealed : \" We have a show where , to raise money , Springfield legalises gay marriage . Homer becomes a minister by going on the internet and filling out a form . A long-time character comes out of the closet , but I 'm not saying who . \" This led to much media speculation and publicity in the press for the episode . Many fans correctly guessed that it would be one of Homer 's sisters-in-law , either Patty or Selma , while others believed it to be Waylon Smithers . = = Film ( 2007 ) = = 20th Century Fox , Gracie Films , and Film Roman produced an animated The Simpsons film that was released on July 27 , 2007 . The production staff of The Simpsons had entertained the thought of a film since early in the series , but production never came together . Groening felt a feature-length film would allow them to increase the show 's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series . The film was directed by David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Groening , Brooks , Jean , Reiss , Mirkin , Scully , George Meyer , John Swartzwelder , Jon Vitti , Matt Selman , and Ian Maxtone-Graham . Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease , taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987 . Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply , which inspired the plot of the film . He also wanted to make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode , as \" we wanna really give you something that you haven 't seen before . \" Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded . After winning a Fox and USA Today competition , Springfield , Vermont hosted the film 's world premiere . The Simpsons Movie grossed a combined total of $ 74 million in its opening weekend in the US , taking it to the top of the box office , and set the record for highest grossing opening weekend for a film based on a television series , surpassing Mission : Impossible II . It opened at the top of the international box office , taking $ 96 million from seventy-one overseas territories \u2014 including $ 27.8 million in the United Kingdom , making it Fox 's second highest opening ever in that country . In Australia , it grossed A $ 13.2 million , the biggest opening for an animated film and third largest opening weekend in the country . As of November 23 , 2007 the film has a worldwide gross of $ 525,267,904 . The film garnered a 90 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , with 171 of a total 191 reviews being determined as positive . It received a rating of 80 out of 100 ( signifying \" generally favorable reviews \" ) on Metacritic from 36 reviews . = = Post movie seasons ( 2007 \u2013 present ) = = Jean continued as showrunner after the movie . Critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in Jean 's tenure . Jacob Burch , an administrator of the website NoHomers.com , said in an interview that the show \" seems less cohesive , more about trying to get the jokes in there , instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that \" and adds \" I just think there 's only so much you can do [ with the characters ] . \" Steven Hyden of A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that \" The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired , meaningless guest stars \" and that the writers are \" content to amuse themselves with in-jokes , non sequiturs , and self-consciously silly plot twists . \" Jean responded to this criticism by saying : \" Well , it 's possible that we 've declined . But honestly , I 've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying , ' It 's gone downhill . ' If we 'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13 . I 'm glad we didn 't . \" The writers of The Simpsons went on strike together with the Writers Guild of America at the end of 2007 . The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike . Since it takes a long time to produce an episode of an animated show , the episodes are written up to a year in advance . So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes . Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors . The dispute was resolved , and the actors ' salary was raised to $ 400,000 per episode . The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20 . = = = 20th anniversary and run length record = = = To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of The Simpsons , Fox announced a year-long celebration of the show titled \" Best . 20 Years . Ever . \" , which ran from January 14 , 2009 to January 14 , 2010 . Morgan Spurlock , an Academy Award nominated documentary filmmaker ( Best Documentary Feature for Super Size Me in 2004 ) and fan of The Simpsons since his college days , was asked to direct the special The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special \u2013 In 3-D ! On Ice ! in February 2009 . Spurlock believes \" the reason [ the producers ] called [ him ] to begin with was to not have a show that would be a glad-hand , pat-everyone-on-the-back special , that 's why rooting it in the people who kept this show on the air for the last 20 years is important . \" It was shown on January 10 , 2010 alongside \" Once Upon a Time in Springfield \" , which was promoted as the 450th episode of the series . The episode \" Million Dollar Maybe \" featured a new character created by the winner of the \" Best . Character . Ever . \" contest , in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new , and possibly recurring , Simpsons character . Over 25,000 entries were sent in . The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange , Connecticut , who created the character Ricardo Bomba . She described Ricardo as \" someone that all the women love and all the men want to be \" and \" something like a Casanova . \" Jean was one of the judges of the contest , which he described as \" a thank you to loyal fans . \" He also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again . Another change was to air The Simpsons in 720p high-definition television with the episode \" Take My Life , Please \" on February 15 , 2009 . With the new broadcasting system came a new opening sequence . It was the first major permanent change to the show 's introduction since the beginning of the show 's second season in 1990 ; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro . This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over Springfield . To commemorate the show 's twentieth anniversary , the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44 cent stamps featuring Homer , Marge , Bart , Lisa and Maggie . The stamps , designed by Groening , were made available for purchase on May 7 , 2009 and approximately one billion stamps were printed . The Simpsons is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition . After entering into their 21st season in late 2009 , the show beat Gunsmoke 's record as the longest-running American primetime , scripted television series . = = = Cancellation threat = = = On October 4 , 2011 , 20th Century Fox Television released a statement saying : \" 23 seasons in , The Simpsons is as creatively vibrant as ever and beloved by millions around the world . We believe this brilliant series can and should continue , but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model . We are hopeful that we can reach an agreement with the voice cast that allows The Simpsons to go on entertaining audiences with original episodes for many years to come . \" One of the problems was that The Simpsons was possibly worth more cancelled than on the air . A 17-year-old syndication deal with local TV stations prohibits Fox from selling the show to cable networks . As long as The Simpsons still produces new episodes , Fox cannot break this deal . In the mean time , cable networks have grown to become just as big a market as the local TV stations . Another consideration was that Fox 's parent company News Corp was having meetings discussing the possibility of a cable channel that would only air The Simpsons episodes . Analyst considers a cancellation and subsequent second-run deal that includes cable networks to be worth $ 750 million . On this issue , Jean commented in an interview with TV Guide that \" It 's a big company , and there are definitely people whose interests would have been better served by ending it . Those interests were superseded because we 're still valuable to the network in terms of our ratings . \" For the negotiations , the studio requested that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23 , or else that season would be the series ' last . The actors were willing to take a pay cut , but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead . At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages , but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages . In the end , the studio and the actors reached a deal , in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent , down to just over $ 300,000 per episode , prolonging the show to its 25th season . As well as the voice actors , everybody involved in the show took a pay cut . This included animators , writers , the post-production crew and even Jean himself . The further use of digital animation also saves money , as the animation of the show becomes more efficient . In 2013 , FXX purchased the exclusive American cable rights to the series . Airing from August 2014 , the show will also be available on-demand via the Simpsons World website . The website is only available in the United States .",

                    "text": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A. Richardson , Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Sanborn Contracts- 1874 ) ( Resigned and appointed Federal Judge by Grant . ) George H. Williams , Attorney General \u2013 ( Pratt & Boyd- 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Columbus Delano , Secretary of Interior \u2013 ( Bogus Agents \u2013 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Orville E. Babcock , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Black Friday \u2013 1869 ) ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Safe Burglary Conspiracy \u2013 1876 ) ( Acquitted in Saint Louis Whiskey Ring trials by jury due to Grant 's defense testimony in his favor . ) John McDonald , Internal Revenue Supervisor , St. Louis \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Indicted and convicted ; served prison time ; claimed Grant was involved in the Whiskey Ring but did not supply any evidence . ) Horace Porter , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) William W. Belknap , Secretary of War \u2013 ( Trading Post Ring- 1876 ) ( Resigned ; Convicted by House ; acquitted by Senate ; indictments against Belknap in Washington D.C. court were dropped by judge at request of Grant and Attorney General Alphonso Taft . ) George M. Robeson , Secretary of Navy \u2013 ( Naval Department Ring- 1876 ) ( Grant defended Robeson in State of the Union address . Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P. Bradley \u2013 1870 Ward Hunt \u2013 1873 Morrison Remick Waite ( Chief Justice ) \u2013 1874 = = = States admitted to the Union = = = Colorado \u2013 August 1 , 1876 Colorado came into the Union just in time to give enough electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

                    "text": "Blue Picardy Spaniel = The Blue Picardy Spaniel ( or \u00c9pagneul Bleu de Picardie ) is a breed of Spaniel originating in France , from the area around the mouth of the River Somme , around the start of the 20th century . It is descended from Picardy Spaniels and English Setters , and is described as a quiet breed that requires much exercise due to its stamina . It is especially good with children . Similar to the Picardy Spaniel , it has a distinctive coloured coat . Recognised by only a handful of kennel associations , the breed is predominantly known in France and Canada . = = Description = = = = = Appearance = = = A Blue Picardy Spaniel on average is around 22 \u2013 24 inches ( 56 \u2013 61 cm ) high at the withers and weighs 43 \u2013 45 pounds ( 20 \u2013 20 kg ) . Its coat is speckled grey black forming a bluish shade , with some black patches . The coat is flat or a little wavy with feathering on the ears , legs , underside and tail . It has long legs with some setter characteristics . It has a long broad nose and muzzle , with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around the tip of the muzzle . Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows . Both the forequarters and the hindquarters are well muscled . Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight . The breed has many similarities with the Picardy Spaniel due to the two breeds ' recent history . The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer , as well as the obvious difference in coat color . The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat , which was brought into the breed by the introduction of English Setter blood . Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards . In addition , the Blue Picardy is a little faster , and has a slightly finer nose . = = = Temperament = = = It is a versatile hunting dog , used for its ability to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions . It is not specialised to any one type of terrain , and tends to score well in field trials . The Blue Picardy is considered to be a quiet breed , but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina . It loves to play , and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship . It is especially good with children . = = Health = = The breed has no known genetic health issues . Blue Picardy Spaniels can be prone to ear infections , which are common among dogs with pendulous ears , including Basset Hounds and other breeds of Spaniel . It has an average life expectancy of thirteen years . = = History = = The first French Spaniel is speculated to have appeared following the Crusades of the 11th century , and it was these breeds of dogs that were described in Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn 's 14th-century work Livre de Chasse . Following the French Revolution the commoners in France were allowed to raise and keep their own hunting dogs . This in turn meant that the pre-existing French Spaniel split into several types specific to their own regions , which were classified according to physical appearance and hunting abilities . At the turn of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was considered a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl . Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom , British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area , near the mouth of the Somme . This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel . While the first black , blue-grey Spaniel was recorded in 1875 , it was not until 1904 when the Picardy Spaniel was first shown . This Spaniel was officially classified as a French Spaniel , and was shown at the Paris Canine Exposition . When the Picard Spaniel and Blue Picardy Spaniel Club was formed in 1907 the two different breeds of Picardy Spaniel were categorised . In France , the Blue Picardy was recognised as a separate breed in 1938 , and there are about 1000 puppies born in France each year . The first person to import the Blue Picardy Spaniel into Canada was Ronald Meunier of Saint-Julien , Quebec , around 1987 , and the breed was then recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club effective 1 June 1995 . The breed is recognised by the American Rare Breed Association , which uses the same standard as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale .",

They are a tall breed , with mares standing 16 hands ( 64 inches , 163 cm ) and over and stallions standing 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) and over . The breed has an enormous capacity for weight pulling , and Shires have held the world records for both largest overall horse and tallest horse at various times . Throughout its history , the breed has been popular for pulling brewery wagons delivering ale to customers . This practice continues today , with the breed also being used for forestry , leisure and promotional pursuits . In 1878 , the British organization now known as the Shire Horse Society was created , with the American Shire Horse Association beginning in 1885 . The breed was exported from Britain to the United States in large numbers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , but popularity fell as mechanisation increased , reaching a low point in the 1950s and 1960s . Popularity began to increase again in the 1970s and after . However , population numbers are still considered to be at critical levels by both the UK-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust and the US-based American Livestock Breeds Conservancy . = = Characteristics = = Shire stallions may be black , bay or grey . They may not be roan or have large amounts of white markings . Mares and geldings may be black , bay , grey or roan . In the UK stallions may not be chestnut , but the colour is allowed by the US registry . Stallions must stand at least 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) high when mature , and they average around 17.2 hands ( 70 inches , 178 cm ) . Geldings stand at least 16.2 hands ( 66 inches , 168 cm ) high and mares at least 16 hands ( 64 inches , 163 cm ) . Their average weight ranges from 900 to 1,100 kg ( 2,000 to 2,400 lb ) The head of a Shire is long and lean , with large eyes , set on a neck that is slightly arched and long in proportion to the body . The shoulder is deep and wide , the chest wide , the back muscular and short and the hindquarters long and wide . Not too much feathering is to occur on the legs , and the hair is fine , straight , and silky . Smaller Shires , under 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) , are generally preferred for working horses , while taller horses , especially those over 18.2 hands ( 74 inches , 188 cm ) , are used for show and promotional purposes . The breed is known for its easy-going temperament . Shires have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema , a chronic progressive disease that includes symptoms of progressive swelling , hyperkeratosis , and fibrosis of distal limbs . The disease is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans . The Shire has an enormous capacity for pulling weight . In 1924 , at a British exhibition , a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons , although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer . Working in slippery footing , the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition . The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire named Mammoth , born in 1848 . He stood 21.2 1 \u2044 4 hands ( 86.25 inches , 219 cm ) high , and his peak weight was estimated at 1,524 kilograms ( 3,360 lb ) . At over 19 hands ( 76 inches , 193 cm ) , a Shire gelding named Goliath was the Guinness Book of World Records record holder for the world 's tallest horse until his death in 2001 . = = Breed history = = Though oxen were used for most farm work into the 18th century , horses ' fit for the dray , the plough , or the chariot ' were on sale at Smithfield Market in London as early as 1145 . The English Great Horse was valued during the reign of Henry VIII , when stallions measuring less than ' fifteen handfuls ' could not be kept , but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle . Oliver Cromwell 's cavalry favoured lighter , faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead . During the 16th century , Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses with them when they came to England to drain the fens , and these horses probably had a significant influence on what became the Shire breed . From this medieval horse came an animal called the Old English Black Horse in the 17th century . The Black Horse was improved by the followers of Robert Bakewell , of Dishley Grange in Leicestershire , resulting in a horse sometimes known as the \" Bakewell Black \" . Bakewell imported six Dutch or Flanders mares , notable since breeders tended to concentrate on improving the male line . Two different types of black horses developed : the Fen or Lincolnshire type and the Leicester or Midlands type . The Fen type tended to be larger , with more bone and extra hair , while the Midlands type tended to have more endurance while being of a finer appearance . The term \" Shire horse \" was first used in the mid-17th century , and incomplete records begin to appear near the end of the 18th century . The \" Packington Blind Horse \" , from Leicestershire , is one of the best-known horses of the era , with direct descendents being recorded from 1770 to 1832 . This horse is usually recognized as the foundation stallion for the Shire breed , and he stood at stud from 1755 to 1770 . During the 19th century , Shires were used extensively as cart horses to move goods from the docks through the cities and countryside . The rough roads created a need for large horses with extensive musculature . In 1878 , the English Cart Horse Society was formed , and in 1884 changed its name to the Shire Horse Society . The Society published a stud book , with the first edition in 1878 containing 2,381 stallions and records dating back to 1770 . Between 1901 and 1914 , 5,000 Shires were registered each year with the British registry . The first Shires were imported to the United States in 1853 , with large numbers of horses being imported in the 1880s . The American Shire Horse Association was established in 1885 to register and promote the breed . The Shire soon became popular in the United States , and almost 4,000 Shires were imported between 1900 and 1918 . Approximately 6,700 Shires were registered with the US registry between 1909 and 1911 . Around the time of World War II , increasing mechanization and strict regulations on the purchase of livestock feed reduced the need for and ability to keep draft horses . Thousands of Shires were slaughtered and several large breeding studs closed . The breed fell to its lowest point in the 1950s and 1960s , and in 1955 fewer than 100 horses were shown at the annual British Spring Show . In the 1970s , the breed began to be revived through increased public interest . Breed societies have been established in the United States , Canada , the Netherlands , France , and Germany , and in 1996 the first World Shire Horse Congress was held in Peterborough . The first use within the breed of artificial insemination through frozen semen was with several Australian mares in 1997 . Between the 1920s and 1930s and today , the Shire has changed in conformation . The Clydesdale was used for crossbreeding in the 1950s and 1960s , which changed the conformation of the Shire and most notably changed the feathering on the lower legs from a mass of coarse hair into the silky feathering associated with modern Shires . At the peak of their population , Shires numbered over a million . In the 1950s and 1960s , this number declined to a few thousand . In the United States , the Shire population dropped significantly in the early part of the 20th century , and continued to decline in the 1940s and 1950s . Between 1950 and 1959 , only 25 horses were registered with the US registry . However , numbers began to increase , and 121 horses were registered in the US by 1985 . The National Shire Horse Spring Show is still held annually and is the largest Shire show in Great Britain . Currently , the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers the population of the Shire to be at \" critical \" levels , meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 2,000 and fewer than 200 registrations are made annually in the US . The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust considers the breed to be \" at risk \" , meaning that population numbers are estimated to be under 1,500 . The Equus Survival Trust considers the breed to be \" vulnerable \" , meaning that between 500 and 1500 active adult breeding mares are in existence today . = = Uses = = The Shire horse was originally the staple breed used to draw carts to deliver ale from the brewery to the public houses . A few breweries still maintain this tradition in the UK . These include the Wadworth Brewery in Devizes , Wiltshire , the Hook Norton Brewery , the Samuel Smith Brewery in Tadcaster , and Thwaites Brewery , which made Shire-drawn deliveries from the early 1800s to the 1920s , then resumed service in 1960 , with deliveries continuing to be horse-drawn to the present day . Several breweries have recently withdrawn their Shire horse teams , including the Tetley brewery in Leeds . Today , the breed is also used for forestry work and leisure riding .",

                    "text": "D\u00f8lehest = The Dole Gudbrandsdal , D\u00f8lahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway . The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed ; it is also considered a part of the Coldblood trotter type . The Dole Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse , known for its pulling power and agility , while the Dole Trotter is a smaller , faster horse used for harness racing ; the two types are commonly interbred . Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the studbook , which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type . The Dole is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley , and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse . Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred , Arabian and other blood added in , especially during the creation of the Dole Trotter in the 19th century . The first studbook was created in 1941 , and the current breed association formed in 1947 . Although originally used mainly as a pack horse , today the heavier Dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes . The Dole Gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding . = = Breed characteristics = = The Dole horses generally stand 14.1 to 15.3 hands ( 57 to 63 inches , 145 to 160 cm ) hands high , weigh 1,190 to 1,390 pounds ( 540 to 630 kg ) , and are usually bay , brown or black , with gray , palomino , chestnut and dun occurring less frequently . White markings may occur on the head and legs , especially on the trotter type . The head is heavy with a straight profile , the neck rather short and muscular , the withers moderately pronounced and broad , the chest wide and deep , and the shoulder strong , muscular and sloping . The back is long and the croup broad , muscular and slightly sloping . The legs are short but sturdy and well-muscled , with broad , solid joints and tough hooves . At one point in the breed 's history it was prone to weak legs and low fertility , but these problems have since been corrected . Dole horses closely resemble the British Fell and Dales ponies , which developed from the same ancestral stock . When presented for grading and studbook inspection , the heavy-type Dole Gudbrandsdals are tested for pulling power and trotting . In the lighter type , x-rays showing the knee and lower legs to be free of defects must be presented , and stallions must have satisfactory results on the track before they may be used for breeding . However , three-year-old stallions may be issued temporary licenses before they begin their racing career if their conformation , breeding , and trotting ability are considered acceptable . Trotting-type mares with proper conformation that are not fast enough during grading may be registered as draft-type Doles . These strict and organized standards have improved the quality of the Dole breed over the past few decades . Although the Dole horse is one of the smallest draft breeds , it shows great pulling power , and is also hardy and agile . They are especially known for their excellent trots , as is shown by the lighter sub-type of the breed . During the late 20th century , interbreeding between the two types became quite common ; due to this , the breed became much more uniform in type , with fewer differences between the trotter and draft sections . = = Breed history = = The Dole is thought to have originated in the Gudbrandsdal , an inland valley in the county of Oppland . It is likely that the Dole is in part a descendant of the Friesian , as the two breeds are similar in conformation , and the Frisian people were known traders in the area between 400 and 800 AD . There was also equine movement between western Norway and northern England during the 9th century through the mid-11th century ; this extended period of trade between these areas likely influenced the strong resemblance between the Dole , Friesian , Fell Pony and Dale Pony breeds . Two stallions , named Odin and Mazarin , had a large influence on the development of the Dole breed . Odin ( son of Partisan ) , was a stallion of Thoroughbred ( some sources say Norfolk Trotter ) breeding , imported to Norway in 1834 . Odin was said to cost \u20a4 257 at the time and to have been bred to over 100 mares in his first four years in Norway . All Dole Trotter horses today contain Odin bloodlines . Mazarin was an Arabian imported to Norway in 1934 . In 1849 , another influential stallion was foaled , named Veikle Balder 4 ; he was a grandson of Odin and is considered the foundation stallion of the heavier Dole type . A stallion named Brimen 825 was used by breeders to maintain and improve some horses of the heavier Dole type for draft uses . In the 19th century , harness racing began to rise in popularity in Norway and breeders looked to create a horse suitable for that sport . The Dole Trotter , a smaller , lighter , faster variation of the draft-type Dole Gudbrandsdal , was then developed . Infusions of Thoroughbred blood , as well as that of various trotting and heavy draft breeds , was used to create this new type . The Dole Trotter was especially influenced between 1840 and 1860 by two other stallions , Toftebrun and Dovre ( an Arabian ) ; the latter is the foundation stallion of the Dole Trotter type . The two types are commonly interbred , especially since 1960 . In 1872 , the Dole Gudbrandsdal was split into two types - a class for heavier agriculture and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses . In 1875 , the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type . In 1902 , the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published , containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892 . In 1903 , the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses . At the same time , standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created . In 1965 , the Norwegian or Dole Trotter studbook was taken over by the Norwegian Trotting Association , as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture . The Dole Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry , and horses have to meet many of the same standards . The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed . Interest in the Dole Gudbrandsdal continued through World War II , and the horses were used heavily during Norway 's occupation by Germany . Breed numbers and interest diminished after the war as increasing mechanization reduced demand for draft animals ; however , a breeding center was established in 1962 to help maintain population numbers . In 1947 , the National D\u00f8lehorse Association was formed to promote and preserve the breed . As of 2002 , there are approximately 4,000 registered Dole Gudbrandsdals , with around 175 new foals registered annually . = = Uses = = When originally developed , Dole Gudbrandsdals were used as pack horses on overland trade routes across Norway , the main one of which connected Oslo with the North Sea and ran through the Gudbrandsdal Valley . The Dole Gudbrandsdal is used mainly for heavy draft and agricultural work , as well as timber hauling , while the lighter Dole Trotter is used mainly for harness racing . The Dole Gudbrandsdal was an influential breed in the formation of the North Swedish Horse , and the two breeds are very similar in conformation . When the Dole and North Swedish breeds are crossed , they produce a lighter-weight horse with more forward gaits that is often used for harness racing . The Dole Gudbrandsdal has also been crossed with Swedish Warmbloods to produce riding-type horses , and it has been theorized that Dole / Thoroughbred crosses may produce nice hunter horses .",

They were originally developed to be all-black show dogs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog . However , during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable to be used for field work . They are now considered to be a rare breed , and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club . Their fur is darker than other spaniels and have no undercoat . Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest . They can make good family dogs and are patient with children , but can require some sort of purpose , be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive . = = History = = The Field Spaniel was originally developed for the show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel . Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised ; one of the first breeders of the Field Spaniel , Thomas Jacobs , said of the origin ; \" Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed ; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type , and frequent missiles have at me and my dogs from behind the hedge . But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about ? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one ( if there ever was one ! ) has not been forthcoming . Like most sporting dogs , they are the result of different crosses . \" They were unpopular with sportsmen as the dark colours of the breed did not show up in hunting conditions , and the elongated and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover . The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett , the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show . Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels . Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel . In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel ; however , it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel with the exception of the head itself . The dog who is considered to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel is Ch . Obo , who was born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother . Obo 's son Ch . Obo II is considered to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel , who was described as being only ten inches high with quite a long body . By 1909 , the average weight of a Field Spaniel was 35 \u2013 45 pounds ( 16 \u2013 20 kg ) . Further mixing of the breed occurred with elements of the Basset Hound introduced . Various genetic health issues arose and action was taken in order to correct the problems within the breed . English Springer Spaniels were used to introduce healthier elements into the breed and resulted in the longer legged spaniel that we know today . Most of the modern breed can be traced to four dogs from the 1950s ; Colombina of Teffont , Elmbury Morwena of Rhiwlas , Gormac Teal , and Ronayne Regal . The Field Spaniel remains a rare breed , even in the UK . In 2009 , a total of 51 dogs were registered with The Kennel Club and has been in steady decline since 2000 . Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club , the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year , with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009 . This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone . In order to promote the breed , they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club . = = Description = = = = = Appearance = = = The standard size for a Field Spaniel is 17 \u2013 18 inches ( 43 \u2013 46 cm ) tall at the withers , and a weight of between 40 \u2013 55 pounds ( 18 \u2013 25 kg ) . This places it roughly between the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel in size . Its long , silky coat comes in solid colours of black , liver , or roan . Tan points , white markings on the throat and the chest can be ticked or the same colour as the rest of the body . They have a moderately long single coat with no undercoat . Feathering of the fur appears on the chest , belly , ears and on the back of the legs . The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur . Docked tails were often used in working dogs , as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult . = = = Temperament = = = The Field Spaniel can be a good family dog while it has a job to do . They are suitable for dog agility and hunting . Without some sort of purpose , the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief . However , they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family . When socialised , they are good with other dogs . They are generally docile and independent , and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels . Stanley Coren 's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence . = = Health = = There are a few ocular conditions to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition .

                    "text": "Florida Cracker Horse = The Florida Cracker Horse is a breed of horse from Florida in the United States . It is genetically and physically similar to many other Spanish-style horses , especially those from the Spanish Colonial Horse group . The Florida Cracker is a gaited breed known for its agility and speed . The Spanish first brought horses to Florida with their expeditions in the early 16th century ; as colonial settlement progressed , they used the horses for herding cattle . These horses developed into the Florida Cracker type seen today , and continued to be used by Florida cowboys ( known as \" crackers \" ) until the 1930s . At this point they were superseded by American Quarter Horses needed to work larger cattle brought to Florida during the Dust Bowl , and population numbers declined precipitously . Through the efforts of several private families and the Florida government , the breed was saved from extinction , but there is still concern about its low numbers . Both The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust consider breed numbers to be at a critical point . = = Characteristics = = The Florida Cracker Horse is also known as the Chickasaw Pony , Seminole Pony , Prairie Pony , Florida Horse , Florida Cow Pony and Grass Gut . The modern breed retains the size of its Spanish ancestors , standing 13.2 to 15 hands ( 54 to 60 inches , 137 to 152 cm ) high and weighing 750 to 1,000 pounds ( 340 to 450 kg ) . They are found mainly in bay , black and gray , although grullo , dun and chestnut are also seen . Roan and pinto colors are occasionally found . They have straight or slightly concave profiles , strong backs and sloping croups . They are known for their speed and agility and excel at trail and endurance riding , and are also used extensively as stock horses . They are sometimes seen in Western riding sports such as working cow horse , team roping and team penning . The Florida Cracker is a gaited horse , with the breed association recognizing two gaits , the running walk and amble , in addition to the regular walk , trot , canter and gallop . The single-footed ambling gait is known as the \" coon rack \" by some breed enthusiasts . The foundation genetics of the breed are the same as many others developed from Spanish stock in North and South America , including the Paso Fino , Peruvian Paso and Criollo . The Cracker horse is very similar in type and genetics to the Carolina Marsh Tacky and the Banker horse , both Spanish-style breeds from the eastern United States , but DNA testing has proven that these are separate breeds . = = History = = Horses first arrived on the southeast North American mainland in 1521 , brought by Ponce de Leon on his second trip to the region , where they were used by officers , scouts and livestock herders . Later expeditions brought more horses and cattle to Spanish Florida . By the late 16th century , horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing , especially in what is now northern Florida and southern Georgia . The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs , Garranos , Spanish Jennets , Sorraias , Andalusians and other Iberian breeds . Overall , they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds , including short backs , sloping shoulders , low set tails and wide foreheads . The early cattle drivers , nicknamed Florida crackers and Georgia crackers , used these Spanish horses to drive cattle ( eventually known as Florida Cracker cattle ) . The cowboys received their nickname from the distinctive cracking of their whips , and the name was transferred to both the horses they rode and the cattle they herded . Through their primary use as stock horses , the type developed into the Florida Cracker horse , known for its speed , endurance and agility . From the mid-16th century to the 1930s , this type was the predominant horse in the southeastern United States . During the American Civil War ( 1861 \u2013 1865 ) , both belligerents purchased large amounts of beef from Florida , and the Spanish horses bred there were highly desired as riding horses . During this time , there was also a continual introduction of new Spanish blood from Cuba , as horses were traded between the two areas . During the Dust Bowl ( 1930 \u2013 1940 ) , large western cattle were moved into Florida , bringing with them the parasitic screwworm . Cattle with this parasite needed to be treated frequently . The cowboys found that the Florida Cracker horses , bred for working smaller cattle , were not able to hold the western cattle . They replaced the smaller horses with American Quarter Horses . This resulted in the Florida breed almost becoming extinct . = = = 20th century = = = The breed 's survival during the 20th century is owed to a few families who continued to breed the Cracker horse and kept distinct bloodlines alive . John Law Ayers was one such breeder ; in 1984 , he donated his herd of pure-bred Cracker horses to the state of Florida . With them , the state started three small herds in Tallahassee , Withlacoochee State Forest and Paynes Prairie State Preserve . By 1989 , however , these three herds and around 100 other horses owned by private families were all that remained of the breed . In 1989 the Florida Cracker Horse Association was founded and in 1991 a registry was established . After the registry was created , 75 horses designated as \" foundation horses \" and 14 of their offspring were immediately registered . These horses came mainly from four lines of Cracker bloodstock and were designated as purebreds by breed experts \u2013 partbred horses were denied entry to the registry . As of 2009 , around 900 horses had been registered since the foundation of the registry . Effective July 1 , 2008 , the Florida House of Representatives declared the Florida Cracker Horse the official state horse . As of 2009 there are three main bloodlines of Cracker stock , as well as a few smaller lines . The state of Florida still maintains two groups of Ayers-line horses in Tallahassee and Withlacoochee for breeding purposes and a display group in the Paynes Prairie Preserve . The state annually sells excess horses from all three herds , and individual breeders also send horses to the sale.The Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at \" critical \" status , as part of the Colonial Spanish Horse family , meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is fewer than 2,000 and there are fewer than 200 registrations annually in the United States . The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be \" critical , \" meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today . However , breed numbers are slowly on the rise . = = = Chickasaw horse = = = The original Chickasaw horse , bred by the Chickasaw Indians using horses captured from De Soto 's expedition , became extinct after being used to create the Florida Cracker Horse and having some influence on the Quarter Horse . Some sources still use the Chickasaw name to describe the Florida Cracker Horses of today . In the 1970s there was a surge of interest in recreating the Chickasaw using horses bearing strong resemblances to the original breed , but this has since died out and the breed association no longer exists .",

                    "text": "Hog Island sheep = Hog Island sheep are a breed of sheep descended from animals first brought to Virginia 's Hog Island in the 18th century . During the 1930s and 1940s , storm conditions forced the island 's residents to evacuate , leaving some sheep behind . These sheep adapted to the environment free of human intervention , becoming feral . The breed is preserved by various organizations because of its relevance to American history and its resemblance to historical American sheep . It also possesses some traits that have been somewhat lost in more modern breeds . = = Breed characteristics = = The Hog Island sheep is a feral breed , descended from sheep abandoned on Hog Island in the 1930s and 1940s . It is believed that the breed was descended from the Merino breed , among others , possibly the Improved Leicester or other English breeds . The sheep is relatively small but tough and hardy . Rams weigh on average 125 pounds ( 57 kg ) and ewes 90 pounds ( 41 kg ) . Lambs are born with spotted or speckled fleece ; about 90 % of adults have white fleece and 10 % black . Both males and females can have horns , and about half the total population do . The Hog Island sheep is not commonly used in modern agriculture , largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics , including maximum size and fleece yield . It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness , foraging skill , efficient use of food , and easy lambing . = = History = = Hog Island was colonized in the 17th century . The sheep that colonists would have been using at the time would have been the contemporary English breeds , but Merinos were known to roam the barrier islands , taken there by Spanish ships that wrecked and let the sheep loose . The colonists would have used some combination of these sheep in their flocks . As an island , Hog Island had open space and lacked predators , therefore the colonists allowed their livestock to roam free , rounding them up only to mark them or to use them for meat or wool . In 1933 a hurricane destroyed most of the island ; the inhabitants abandoned the settled areas and many sheep were left to fend for themselves , reverting to a feral state . The Nature Conservancy bought the island in the 1970s , rounded up the sheep , and removed them to prevent overgrazing . The breed is extremely rare today ; with fewer than 200 registered animals it is listed as \" Critical \" by The Livestock Conservancy . = = = Research and conservation ( after rediscovery ) = = = When the Nature Conservancy bought Hog Island , most of the sheep were bought by private owners . Some were taken to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University , where they were studied to determine why they were relatively free of parasites ; the researchers concluded that the sheep had no special resistance to parasites but were simply isolated from them by their habitat . The sheep were then sent to institutions such as George Washington 's birthplace , Mount Vernon , and Colonial Williamsburg for preservation . The United States Department of Agriculture 's National Animal Germplasm Program has collected semen samples from several of the sheep as part of a program that aims to preserve the genetic material of animals significant to American history . Because Hog Island sheep resemble the small , short-fleeced sheep that would have been raised in colonial farms for meat and wool , they ( or a cross between them and Dorset sheep , a combination called \" American Site sheep \" ) are used in exhibits to recreate the look and feel of a historical farm . Because the Hog Island sheep population is so small , the preservation of the breed through a pure , inbred line would threaten the breed 's health by an increased risk of pairing of \" bad genes \" . Stillbirths and atypical-looking sheep have been reported by some breeders . In response , some breeders have crossed Hog Island sheep with other breeds , including Gulf Coast Native sheep , and then bred the offspring with pure Hog Island sheep , producing almost pure Hog Island sheep except for the addition of some genetic diversity .",

                    "text": "Italian Heavy Draft = The Italian Heavy Draft , or Rapid Heavy Draft , is a breed of draft horse from Italy . The full Italian name of the breed is Cavallo Agricolo Italiano da Tiro Pesante Rapido , \" Italian Rapid Heavy Draft Farm Horse \" , and the abbreviation TPR ( Italian pronunciation : [ tipi\u02c8erre ] ) ) is often used . Generally chestnut in color , the breed is known for its combination of strength and speed . Its development traces to 1860 and continued through the late 19th and early 20th centuries as breeders utilized a mix of foundation bloodstock that included native Italian stock and imported horses , all mainly of draft type . Its versatility has led to its use in both agricultural and military capacities , as well as for the production of mules . In 1926 , a stud book was formed , and population numbers continued to rise until the beginning of World War II . Breeding programs suffered during the war , and despite care afterward , population numbers continued to dwindle as increasing mechanization decreased the need for draft horses . In the 1970s , selective breeding goals were changed to produce a horse suitable for meat production , which today remains the primary use of the Italian Heavy Draft . = = Breed characteristics = = The Italian Heavy Draft generally stands between 14.2 and 15.3 hands ( 58 and 63 inches , 147 and 160 cm ) high , and weighs between 1,320 and 1,540 pounds ( 600 and 700 kg ) . They are generally chestnut ( usually with flaxen mane and tail ) , although they may be red roan , or bay . The head is light for a draft breed , with a straight or slightly convex profile , and it is set on a short , broad and muscular neck . The withers are fairly pronounced and muscular , the chest broad and deep , and the shoulders sloping . The back is straight and short , the flanks short and rounded , with a sloping croup . The legs are short , with broad joints and smallish , though well-formed , hooves . It closely resembles the Breton breed , which was used heavily in the creation of the Italian Heavy Draft . Although larger , it also bears a resemblance to the Haflinger , also developed in northern Italy . Horses that meet the breed conformation standards set by the breed registry are branded with a design of a ladder with five pegs enclosed by a shield . Foals are examined twice , at between two and seven months and again two and a half years . Horses passing the first evaluation are branded on the left hindquarter ; those that pass the second are marked again on the left side of the neck . = = History = = Selection for what eventually became the Italian Heavy Draft was begun in 1860 at the Deposito Cavalli Stalloni ( military stud ) of Ferrara , Italy . The breed was originally developed by crossing native stock with large Brabant horses . While the resulting horses were strong , they were not light or fast enough for the farm work required of them by the Italians . To make the breed lighter and faster , Percheron and Boulonnais blood were added . However , the resulting horse was still not exactly what its creators were looking for , and in the 19th century they added more Breton blood to the mix , bringing the breed to its current conformation and gaits . In 1926 , a stud book was begun , and selection processes were developed to select horses for use in draft capacities . The breeding programs suffered during World War II , but a careful crossbreeding program with Ardennes , Percheron and Breton horses after the war brought the Italian Heavy Draft to its current state . Despite the Italian Heavy Draft 's early popularity as a strong but fast draft horse , increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses , and population numbers declined . In the 1970s , selection processes were changed to focus on the production of animals for horse meat , and that has continued to be the primary focus through the present time . In 1976 , a breed association was formed in Italy to preserve and promote the Italian Heavy Draft . The association is charged with maintaining the stud book , evaluating breeding stock , granting equine passports , maintaining genetic databases , and exhibiting the breed . The main breeding areas for the Italian Heavy Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona , Padova , Vicenza , Venice , Treviso and Udine . In 2005 , it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian Heavy Drafts , about half of which were mares . The registered population at the end of 2010 was 6304 , with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria ; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported . No modern trace remains of the slower Italian Slow Heavy Draft Horse , the Cavallo Italiano da Tiro Pesante Lento , subject of a biometric and morphological study in 1939 . = = Uses = = The Italian Heavy Draft was originally bred to be a versatile horse used in agriculture , urban settings , and military capacities , as well as for the production of large mules for the military . The breed 's docility , size , strength , and speed made it extremely useful for Italian farmers before the introduction of mechanization . It is still used for farming in a few areas where mechanization is impractical . The mares are also still used for the production of mules , although most horses today are bred for meat . Italy is one of the top global consumers of horse meat ; consumption jumped by 31 percent between 2001 and 2006 . Eleven- to eighteen-month-old foals are preferred for slaughter .",

                    "text": "Welara = The Welara is a part-Arabian pony breed developed from the Arabian horse and the Welsh pony . It was originally bred in England by Lady Wentworth at the Crabbet Arabian Stud in the early 1900s from imported Arabian stallions and Welsh pony mares . Breeding then spread throughout North America . In 1981 , a breed registry was formed in the United States , and a studbook began to be published . They are used for many disciplines of English riding , and are known for their refinement , hardiness and spirit . = = Breed characteristics = = Welara stallions average 14 to 15 hands ( 56 to 60 inches , 142 to 152 cm ) and mares 13.1 to 14.3 hands ( 53 to 59 inches , 135 to 150 cm ) . To be registered , Welaras must stand between 11.2 and 15 hands ( 46 and 60 inches , 117 and 152 cm ) high . Crosses between Arabians and each of the four sections of Welsh Pony ( A , B , C and D ) tend to produce slightly different types of pony . Section A Welsh Pony crosses ( the smallest ) tend to be under 13 hands ( 52 inches , 132 cm ) , and be used mainly as light driving ponies and mounts for small children . Section B crosses usually stand 13 to 13.2 hands ( 52 to 54 inches , 132 to 137 cm ) and can be used for driving and as riding ponies for larger children and small adults . Section C crosses average 13.2 to 14.2 hands ( 54 to 58 inches , 137 to 147 cm ) hands and tend to be a heavier pony , sometimes with feathered feet , although still showing the refinement of their Arabian ancestors . Section D crosses generally stand 13.3 to 15 hands ( 55 to 60 inches , 140 to 152 cm ) high . The latter two types are suited to riding by average and slightly larger adults and for the majority of disciplines . All colors other than Appaloosa are allowed for registration . Welara Sport Ponies may be of any color or size , without the restrictions of the purebred Welara . The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement , spirit and hardiness , as well as good movement . The head is small and slightly concave , the neck is arched ( and prone to be cresty in stallions ) . The shoulders and croup are long and the back short . Welaras are used mainly in English riding , especially in hunter classes . They are also seen in show jumping , three-day eventing , pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses . Welara / Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes . = = History = = Crosses began to be made between the Arabian horse and the Welsh Pony in Sussex , England the early 1900s , by Lady Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud . She began breeding Arabian stallions , including Skowronek ( 1909 \u2013 1930 ) , a Polish Arabian stud , to Welsh mares from North Wales , especially the Coed Coch stud farm , which she imported beginning in the early 1920s . Other breeders in England and North America soon followed suit , although at this time they were not focused on creating a new breed , and the cross became known as the Welara . In 1981 , a breed registry , called the American Welara Pony Registry , was created in the US in order to develop and promote the breed . A studbook also began to be published , and pedigrees of Welaras were collected and preserved . Only Welsh and Arabian blood is allowed for purebreds , and all registered ponies must have at least 1 / 8 and no more than 7 / 8 blood from each breed . As of 2005 , the registry claimed slightly over 1,500 ponies registered in North America , with around 100 new foals registered annually . Welara Sport Ponies may also be registered \u2013 these are ponies at least 50 percent Welara but with blood from other breeds , often the Thoroughbred . The association also registers pureblood Welsh and Arabian foundation stock . Welaras have now spread to additional areas of the world , including the Caribbean , Oceania and Europe . In Europe , Welsh / Arabian crosses , sometimes with additional Thoroughbred blood , are often called \" riding ponies \" or \" sport ponies \" . In the US , the breed is seen most often in the central and western parts of the country .",

                    "text": "Russkiy Toy = The Russian Toy ( also known as the Russian Toy Terrier , and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy , Russian : \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0439 ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier . There are two types coats in the breed : smooth coat and long coat . The smooth coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier . Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \" Terrier \" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008 , allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010 . The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia . The breed was nearly wiped out twice ; first in the 1920s with the rise of Communism due to the toy dog 's traditional link to the aristocracy and again in the 1990s with the influx of foreign breeds following the fall of the Iron Curtain . The smooth coat type is the older of the two , with the long coat type first appearing in 1958 . Until the 1990s , the breed was almost unknown outside of Russia , and so relatively few details on associated health issues are known . The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter and as a watchdog , and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter . It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the family unit . Due to its size and similarities to the chihuahua , the two are often compared . = = Description = = The Russian Toy is one of the smallest breeds in the world , measuring between 20 cm and 28 cm and weighing anywhere between 1 kg and 3 kg . It has a small distinctive head with large eyes and triangular ears . In countries where docking is prohibited , the tail is curved in the shape of a sickle . There are two types in the breed , distinguished by their coats ; one is long coated and the other smooth coated . The smooth coated dog has a short , shiny , close-lying coat . The long coated variety has a longer coat and profuse feathering in the ears , legs and tail . The feathering or \" fringe \" on the ears is usually 3 to 5 cm long , can be straight or with a slight wave . It will be grown by the age of three and should completely cover the outer edges and tips of the ears . The smooth coat type of the breed closely resembles the Pra\u017esk\u00fd Krysa\u0159\u00edk breed of the Czech Republic . The Pra\u017esk\u00fd on average is a little shorter on leg and a little heavier than the Russian Toy . Both of the Russian Toy varieties can be crossed and produce smooth and long coated puppies from the same litter . In addition , when two smooth coated dogs are bred together , they may occasionally bear a long coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees . However , there have been no records of two long coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth coated offspring . The breed has four main colors : black and tan , blue and tan , brown and tan , solid red of various shades . Red includes sable ( red where the tips of the hairs are black , known as overlay ) and red sable ( red with brown overlay ) . = = Health = = A Russian Toy will often require the help of a veterinarian to remove any retained deciduous teeth ( known as \" puppy teeth \" or \" baby teeth \" ) that fail to fall out and make way for the permanent teeth . Without this intervention , usually done under anesthetic , the baby and permanent teeth will occupy the same socket in the jaw , which can cause tartar deposits , tooth decay , gingivitis and periodontitis , and can lead to premature loss of teeth . Retained puppy teeth can also cause misalignment of the teeth . As with most breeds of dog , the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation , which is where the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that normally holds it in place is too shallow . It is usually an inherited defect , which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma . Russian Toys can suffer from bone fractures due to their small and sometimes delicate nature . = = Temperament = = Active and cheerful , the Russian Toy was originally bred both as an anti-rat dog and a watch dog . The second quality is still active in the breed , and they can be very vocal . They can become quite attached to their family , regardless of the ages of the family members . Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers , but very loyal to their owners , always ready to protect them from any perceived danger . = = History = = The first evidence of English style terriers in Russia can be seen in the Museum of Zoology in Saint Petersburg . On display is an English style terrier dated 1716 \u2013 1726 with a sign that reads \" This dog is a short hair terrier named Lizetta . It personally belonged to the Russian Emperor Peter the Great . \" Indeed , the breed was developed as a companion dog for Russian nobility . According to some accounts , records indicate that eight smooth coated Russian Toys competed in a dog show in St. Petersburg as far back as 1874 . The more generally accepted first reference to the breed appears in May 1907 when 11 Russian Toys were shown at an exhibition in St. Petersburg . In 1923 , two dogs appeared at a Moscow dog show and in 1924 , three more were awarded medals at a show in Odessa . But as a result of the October Revolution , the Russian Toy diminished in popularity and in numbers as these types of dogs were closely linked to the aristocracy and therefore frowned upon . In 1947 , only one dog was shown in St. Petersburg . When breeding began to revitalize the stock of Russian Toys in Russia , only a few of the dogs left had pedigrees or were purebred . The lack of numbers and political isolation of the country at the time caused the creation of a new breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed . The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier , with the addition of some new characteristics . The head is high but not wide , the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round . By 1960 , 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture . In 1988 , the Russian Kynological Federation published a new breed standard , combining the short coated Russian Toy Terrier and the long coated Moscow Toy Terrier under \" Russian Toy Terrier . \" However , after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 , the popularity of imported exotic breeds nearly drove the Russian Toy into extinction . A resurgence occurred thanks to a new energetic generation of dog breeders , but the breed remained virtually unknown outside of Russia until the 1990s . Several kennels have now been established outside Russia , the most successful ones located in Finland , Estonia , Belarus , Ukraine and Czech Republic . Interest in the breed is on the rise in the USA and Japan . The Russian Toy was provisionally recognised by the Federation Cynologique Internationale in 2006 and is expected to gain definitive recognition in 2016 . The United Kennel Club and The Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club both accepted the breed in 2008 Russian Toys are also recognized by the American Rare Breed Association and International All Breed Canine Association . = = = Development of the long coated Russian Toy = = = The original long coated Russian Toy is arguably a dog named Chikki born on 12 October 1958 to two smooth coated dogs that both had slightly longer hair than was typical . Initially , the puppy was not to be registered as its coat was too long meet the breed standard , and usually such dogs would not participate in breeding programs and would often be put down . Chikki , however , was registered with a pedigree and purchased by Evgeniya Fominichna Zharova . Zharova is thus the long coated variety 's founding breeder as the first breeder to intentionally retain and breed a dog with a longer coat . Chikki developed an ear fringe and was mated with a female named Irma , who also had a longer coat than most smooth coated dogs , and together they produced a litter of three long coated puppies . Zharova developed the breed in Moscow , and so it came to be known as the Moscow Toy Terrier . The breed made its first appearance at a dog show in 1964 and the standard was set in 1966 . Ten years after Chikki 's birth , between 1968 and 1969 , approximately 300 long coated dogs were registered - a significant amount considering that Russian Toy litters tend to be small , typically one to three puppies . Today , the long coated variety has an established presence in Poland , Czech Republic , Estonia , Ukraine and a number of other countries , but the breeding program is particularly strong in Finland . The first Russian Toy was brought to Finland in 1988 when a long coated male named Black-Champion-Bonaparte was imported from Russia and registered by Sirpa Lehtinen under Kennel Jojamint 's . A female named Ste-Shihu was brought later that same year from Estonia by the same owner , and the two produced Finland 's first Russian Toy litter ( Jojamint 's Agostini and Jojamint 's Alboreto ) also in 1988 . Black-Champion-Bonaparte and Ste-Shihu were the first Russian Toys to appear in a dog show in Finland in 1989 . = = American Kennel Club history = = The Foundation Stock Service ( FSS ) of the American Kennel Club ( AKC ) accepted the Russian Toy into its records in August 2008 , and in July 2009 , the Russian Toy was approved to compete in AKC companion events from 1 January 2010 onwards . Russian Toys can also be shown and earn Certificate of Merit Points at FSS Open shows . In 2008 , the AKC board and FSS also acknowledged the Russian Toy Club of America ( RTCA ) . The following year , the AKC board and FSS acknowledged Russian Toy Dog Club of America , Inc . ( RTDCA ) . In 2010 this second club , RTDCA , decided to become the National Club for the Russian Toy breed in the United Kennel Club ( UKC ) , where it became known as the Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America , Inc . ( RTDCA ) . In 2013 , the RTDCA was asked by AKC to separate into two distinct clubs with different officers to form two independent clubs : one to represent the AKC club and the other to represent the UKC Club . The AKC Russian Toy Dog Club of America added the word \" The \" to their name and became The Russian Toy Dog Club of America ( TRTDCA ) while the UKC club retained the original Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America name ( RTDCA ) . In August 2013 , AKC stated that the two clubs RTCA and TRTDCA must combine into one club to represent the Russian Toy breed in the AKC .",

The breed enjoyed success during the 1950s but this subsided during the foot and mouth crisis . Today , the breed is enjoying a revival , due to the demands of the beef market . The breed is considered average size and they have a thick coat , due to the climate of their native Scotland . = = Etymology = = Galloway was an ancient region located in the south-west of Scotland . The word ' Galloway ' is derived from the words Gallovid , or Gaul . The Gauls were the south of Scotland . = = History = = The Galloway breed comes from the cattle native to the south-west region of Scotland , first fully developed in the 17th century . Originally there was much variation within this breed , including many different colours and patterns . The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle , but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population , and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book . As a result , although black is still the most common colour for Galloways , they can also be red and several shades of dun . In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed . The Galloway was introduced in Canada in 1853 , first registered in 1872 , and the first Galloway registry was introduced in the USA in 1882 . In 1911 , 35,000 cattle were registered in the American Galloway Herd Book which was first created in 1882 . The British Galloway Society formed in 1908 . They did not recognise dun coloured Galloway cattle , which was met with outrage and this ban was later lifted . In 1951 , Galloway cattle were introduced to Australia . In the 1950s the breed enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input ( feed ) cattle with high quality meat . However , the BSE crisis ( commonly referred to as mad cow disease ) caused an export ban in 1990 , although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle . This created a fear associated with cattle , so breed numbers declined . Recent years have seen changes as bigger leaner carcasses were demanded . This issue of size featured in Galloway circles causes great debate . Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer . Today the breed 's original characteristics are now back in demand . This is due to the demand of high quality meat that requires economical production . = = Characteristics = = The average Galloway cow will weigh 1000 to 1500 pounds and the average bull weighing 1700 to 2300 pounds . The healthy birth weight for a calf is 75 pounds . Galloways have a thick double-layered coat that is wavy or curly . This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies so well that they have a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies , which would otherwise create waste at slaughter . This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates . Despite the animal 's usual use in beef production , there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production . The Galloway is naturally hornless , and instead of horns has a bone knob at the top of its skull called the poll . This breed 's shaggy coat has both a thick , woolly undercoat for warmth and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water , making them well adapted to harsher climates . = = = Population = = = It is thought that the breed number fewer than 10,000 cattle in the world , most located in Northern Europe , specifically Scotland . The breed is ' rare ' in the United States and the Livestock Conservancy class it as a breed to ' watch ' . = = Societies = = Galloway Cattle Society of New Zealand American Galloway Breeders Association The Galloway Cattle Society of Great Britain and Ireland Australian Galloway Association",

                    "text": "Buckeye chicken = The Buckeye is a breed of chicken originating in the U.S. state of Ohio . Created in the late 19th century , Buckeyes are the only American Poultry Association ( APA ) standard breed of chicken known to have been created by a woman , and the only one in the American Class to have a pea comb . As of 2014 , Buckeyes are listed as \" Threatened \" by The Livestock Conservancy . The breed 's name is derived from Ohio 's nickname of \" Buckeye state \" , and their mahogany color is said ideally to resemble the seeds of the Ohio Buckeye plant ( Aesculus glabra ) . They are a dual-purpose chicken that have a decent laying ability and strong meat production characteristics . Buckeyes are yellow skinned chickens that lay brown eggs . = = History = = The Buckeye was first bred and developed in 1896 , by a Warren , Ohio resident named Nettie Metcalf . They are the only American breed of chicken known to have been developed by a woman , despite the fact that women were customarily given charge of the household poultry flock throughout much of U.S. history . Metcalf crossbred Barred Plymouth Rocks , Buff Cochins , and some black breasted red games to produce the Buckeye . Her goal was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters . Contrary to popular belief the Buckeye breed was created before the Rhode Island Red breed and Metcalf actually sent birds to the RIR breeders for them to improve their breed . The Buckeye was admitted to the American Poultry Association 's Standard of Perfection in 1904 . Entrance into the Standard of Perfection signifies official certification as a breed by the Association , and thus allows Buckeyes to be entered into poultry shows and judged according to the breed standard ( as outlined in the Standard of Perfection ) . The recognition of Buckeyes in the Standard has been a significant factor in its survival . In the past , largely due its lack of color variations , the Buckeye has not been an especially popular exhibition breed , but there is growing interest in the exhibition poultry fancy for this dual-purpose variety of bird . Not adopted by commercial operations , the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks . Today the breed status is listed as threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , threatened being defined as Threatened : Fewer than 1,000 breeding birds in the United States , with seven or fewer primary breeding flocks , and estimated global population less than 5,000 . The breed is also included in the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste , a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction . = = Characteristics = = The Buckeye male weighs an average of 9 lb ( 4.1 kg ) , and the hen 6.5 lb ( 2.9 kg ) . The breed has yellow skin and lays brown eggs . Its primary color is a mahogany red with black tails ; sometimes males have other dark feathering . According to the breed standard , a Buckeye 's plumage should ideally resemble the hue of an Ohio Buckeye 's seeds . Especially in the hen , the breed is very similar in appearance to the Rhode Island Red . The Buckeye can be differentiated by a bar of slate color on the back feathers close to the body ; the body is also much more compact , with a short yet broad back . The Buckeye is the only purely American breed to sport a pea comb , and this , combined with its stocky build , makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken . Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. ( such as the Ameraucana ) may sport pea combs , but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds . It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition , being assertive in character and a very good forager . Generally calm , the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive . Despite its game heritage , it tolerates confinement well , although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass . The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking . A good meat producer and layer of between 150 to 200 eggs per year , the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken well \u2013 suited to small farmyard and backyard flocks .",

                    "text": "Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus = Elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses ( EEHV ) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1 ' is a type of herpesvirus , which can cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants . In African elephants , related forms of these viruses , which have been identified in wild populations , are generally benign , occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions . However , some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants , which kills up to 80 % of severely affected individuals . The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs , but this has only been effective in around a third of cases . The first case of a fatal form of the disease was documented in 1995 , though tissue samples from as early as the 1980s have since tested positive for the virus , and localized skin lesions in wild African elephants were recorded in the 1970s . Since 1995 , there have been over fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe , of which only nine have been successfully cured . Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity , though a small number of older wild-born adults held in zoos have died , and a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in Asian elephant populations . = = Virus and transmission = = The EEHVs are members of the Proboscivirus genus , a novel clade most closely related to the mammalian betaherpesviruses that have been responsible for as many as 70 deaths of both zoo and wild Asian elephants worldwide , especially in young calves . There are currently six known species / types of the probosciviruses , and the most commonly encountered and most pathogenic form EEHV1 also has two chimeric subtypes , 1A and 1B . , as well as numerous distinct strains . EEHV1A ( originally just known as EEHV1 ) was the first species / type identified , which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high mortality rate in Asian elephants . This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally in African elephants ( occasionally producing skin nodules ) , and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity , but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species / types of EEHV ( e.g. EEHV2 , EEHV3 and EEHV6 ) instead have been identified in African elephants . A second lethal subtype , EEHV1B , was identified in Asian elephants in 2001 . EEHV3 , EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each been responsible for the deaths of at least one Asian elephant calf . EEHV2 has caused hemorrhagic disease in several African elephants as reported by . Along with EEHV3 and EEHV6 it has also been found in pulmonary lymph nodes of several autopsied wild and zoo African elephants . There are a further five or six species / types and varieties of elephant gammaherpesvirus ( EGHVs ) found in eye and genital secretions of many healthy Asian and African zoo elephants - e.g. EGHV1 , EGHV2 , EGHV3A , EGHV3B , EGHV4 and EGHV5 ( also called Elephantid herpesviruses EIHV3 , EIHV4 , EIHV5 , EIHV6 , ElHV9 and ElHV10 - which are gamma herpesviruses . But these are neither closely related to the EEHVs , nor the known cause of any disease symptoms . Studies have also detected both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant herdmates of calves that previously had disease. and similarly for EEHV5 . Thus , similar to saliva for most human and animal herpesviruses , the trunk secretions may be a source of transmission for EEHVs . Because of concerns about the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross-species transmission for EEHV3 , long-term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged , along with avoiding new contacts between young captive-born Asian elephants and wild-born Asian elephants , as the latter may be carriers of the disease . An analysis of a number of North American cases , which ruled out the direct transmission of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied , strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population . This is supported by the fact that some of the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants . Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor , notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times ( even at the same facility ) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus , yet when two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains . A program of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005 , aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to the virus in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns . = = Effects and treatment = = In benign infections found in some wild and captive African elephants , these viruses can affect either the skin or the pulmonary system . In the former case , it produces small pinkish nodules on the head and trunk in juveniles , which appear for a few weeks and then regress , suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant . In the second case , it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults . These are both characteristic of EEHV2 , EEHV3 and EEHV6 . In a fatal attack , however , it manifests very quickly . In a number of cases , death has occurred within 24 hours of the onset of the infection , while other cases do not last longer than around five days . The virus attacks endothelial cells , rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging ; once this reaches the heart , the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock . Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat , a rapid heartbeat , and decreased blood-cell count , as well as cyanosis of the tongue , mouth ulcers , and oedema of the head and trunk . Rapid treatment with famciclovir , sustained for around a month , has appeared to cure eight calves infected with EEHV1 ; however , this treatment is very expensive , only partially effective , and relies on early identification of the infection . A polymerase chain reaction test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA , though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case . Prior to the development of the test , or in circumstances where it is not available , the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death , including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis . = = History = = The virus has been identified in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants as far back as the 1970s . The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington , D.C. , in 1995 ; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus . These cases have so far been identified as early as 1983 . Since this date , there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe , nine of which were successfully treated . The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation . This gives a fatality rate of over 80 % among known symptomatic disease cases . In cases where antiviral medication was applied , treatment was effective in about one in three cases . As of 2005 , there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used , eight of which were fatal . As a fraction of the overall population , it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007 , 19 are known to have died of EEHV , and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication . The affected animals are mostly young Asian elephants that had been born in captivity , with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years ( and three-quarters between one and eight years old ) . Some cases have affected newborns or adult elephants born in the wild ( oldest aged 40 years ) , and three recorded cases have affected African elephants . The first documented fatal case for African elephants was Kijana , an eleven-month-old male in 1996 . Since 2008 , a number of cases have been attributed to EEHV1 among wild Asian elephants . The first suspected case in Asia was in 1997 , though it was not until the fifth suspected case that the presence of the virus could be confirmed . This case was reported in 2006 , with the death of a young wild-born female calf at an elephant sanctuary in Cambodia . The virus was identified as part of the EEHV1 group , the same as previously identified in the North American and European captive populations . In 2013 , nine lethal cases from India were extensively characterized and found to consist of a wide variety of genetically diverged strains of EEHV1A and EEHV1B matching the subtypes and genetic range of nearly all those found previously in Europe and North America . Cases attributed to EEHV1A and EEHV4 have also been reported in Thailand and there is both confirmed and anecdotal evidence for similar hemorrhagic disease deaths of between 16 and 30 more calves in Asian countries including Thailand , India , Nepal , Myanmar and Indonesia within the past five years . Thus , this is not just a disease of captive elephants , but is endogenous to and possibly rampant in Asian elephants in the wild also . Further research has been noted as \" urgently required \" to study the situation in regions with wild Asian elephant populations .",

He currently serves as the CEO of Zayat Stables , LLC , a Thoroughbred horse racing business which bred and owns the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah . Joe Drape of The New York Times described Zayat as \" controversial \" and \" one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing . \" Zayat was born in Cairo , Egypt to a wealthy family , and grew up in an ethnically-diverse neighborhood where he learned to ride horses . At age 18 , he moved to the United States where he attended college and ultimately obtained a master 's degree in business and public health from Boston University . After a brief career in commercial real estate in New York City , he returned to Egypt , and for about a decade ran the Al-Ahram Beverages Company , which he owned as part of an investment group . After the company was purchased by Heineken in 2002 , Zayat stayed on a few more years but also began investing in racehorses and established Zayat Stables in 2005 . Upon returning to the United States for good in 2007 , he made his racing stables his full-time occupation , working with his son , Justin , to build the business . While generally successful with his race horses , his goal of winning the Kentucky Derby eluded him several times , including three second-place finishes , until his win with American Pharoah . He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses . Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization , but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing . Nonetheless , Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems , a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award . The Zayat family are Orthodox Jews . He currently lives in Teaneck , New Jersey with his wife , Joanne . They have four children : Ashley , Justin , Benjamin , and Emma . Their eldest son , Justin , helps run the Zayat Stables operation , and their youngest , Emma , inspired the name of Littleprincessemma , dam of American Pharoah . = = Early career and personal life = = Ahmed Zayat ( / z\u0259 'j\u0251\u02d0t / ; Arabic : \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u0627\u062a ) , also known as Ephraim David Zayat ( Hebrew : \u05d0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d6\u05d9\u05d0\u05ea ) , was born in Egypt in 1962 to an affluent Egyptian Jewish family and grew up an ethnically diverse neighborhood in the Cairo suburb of Maadi . His father , Alaa al-Zayat , was a prominent doctor and professor of medicine , a personal physician to Anwar Sadat . His grandfather , Ahmed Hasan al-Zayyat , was a leading intellectual who established the Egyptian literary magazine al-Risala , described as \" the most important intellectual weekly in 1930s Egypt and the Arab world . \" Born into what was then a peasant family , the earlier al-Zayyat studied at Al-Azhar University before taking up legal studies in Cairo and Paris ; he taught Arabic literature at American University in Cairo , and for three years in Baghdad , before founding al-Risala in 1933 . As a young man , Ahmed Zayat learned to ride horses at the local country club . Zayat competed in show jumping during his early teens , winning national titles as a child in the under-12 and under-14 age divisions . He moved to the United States at the age of 18 , and earned an undergraduate degree from Yeshiva University . He obtained a master 's degree in public health administration from Boston University . Though the Zayat Stables , LLC website once stated that Zayat attended Harvard University , he did not . After graduation , he worked for Zev Wolfson , a New York City commercial real estate developer and investor . Zayat described Wolfson as \" the toughest guy I ever worked for ... such a perfectionist . A great negotiator . \" Zayat returned to Egypt in 1995 and formed an investment group , which purchased the Al-Ahram Beverages Company in 1997 , outbidding Anheuser-Busch and Heineken International . Al-Ahram had been owned by the Egyptian government and Zayat had helped find American investors to take over government-owned businesses that had been nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser back in the 1950s . The original beer product was of poor quality , mocked as being able to \" power heavy machinery if there was no diesel fuel available . \" Under Zayat 's leadership , additional brands of beer were introduced , and he developed a non-alcoholic beer , Fayrouz , designed specifically for the Muslim market . The company was modernized from a run-down operation to a publicly traded business that sold in 2002 to Heineken International for $ 280 million , more than three times its pre-acquisition valuation , in what was then the largest corporate buyout in Egyptian history . Zayat continued to run Al-Ahram until 2007 , but periodically returned to the United States , where he started buying racehorses and formed Zayat Stables in 2005 . His motivation to return to the US was , in part , to commute less and be more involved with his family and children . Upon leaving Al-Ahram , he declared that he was \" retiring \" , but as his wife explained , \" he can 't be retired for more than 15 seconds , \" and he soon expanded his horse operation to include both breeding and racing stock . He still owns other business interests in Egypt , including being the majority shareholder of Misr Glass Manufacturing , which is Egypt 's largest maker of glass containers . Zayat lives in Teaneck , New Jersey , with his wife , Joanne . The couple have four children : Ashley , Justin , Benjamin and Emma . Justin , a 2015 graduate of New York University , works closely with his father in the Zayat Stables business . While residing primarily in New Jersey , the Zayats also have residences in New York , Egypt and London . The family are Orthodox Jews ; Zayat 's Hebrew name is Ephraim ( \u05d0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd ) , used by family and community . Zayat donates to Jewish schools and charities , including those that help special-needs children . Although The New York Times has stated that Zayat has publicly identified as both Jewish and Muslim at times , his family attends Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck , keeps the Jewish Sabbath , and observes kosher laws regarding food . When questioned about his religious affiliation , Zayat stated , \" Why is it relevant , and why does it matter ? It 's personal . \" = = Zayat Stables = = Zayat first began buying Thoroughbred race horses in 2005 . Zayat Stables owns approximately 200 horses at any one time . Zayat made a number of big-ticket sales purchases early on including a horse he named Maimonides , purchased at Keeneland as a yearling in 2006 for $ 4.6 million . In addition , Zayat paid $ 1.6 million for the highest-priced horse at the 2006 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga select yearling sale , a filly by Empire Maker named Mushka , whom he resold in 2008 for $ 2.4 million . Maimonides was named in honor of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides , who is respected by both Jews and Muslims . At the time , Zayat explained , \" If this horse was going to be a superstar , I wanted an appropriate name ... I wanted it to be pro-peace , and about loving your neighbor . \" Zayat also had difficulty obtaining the name from the Jockey Club , as it had been reserved by Earle I. Mack , who owned race horses and also happened to be the chairman of the board of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , at Zayat 's alma mater , Yeshiva University . After Zayat donated $ 100,000 to the school to \" promote peace , \" Mack released his reservation of the name . But , in the first of Zayat 's many racing disappointments , the colt 's promising racing career was cut short by injury after two races . The horses of Zayat Stables began to earn race purses in 2006 . In 2008 , Zayat was North America 's leading owner by earnings . Zayat Stables ranked second in the nation for earnings in 2007 , third in 2009 , fourth in 2010 and fifth nationally in 2011 . Between 2006 and 2014 , Zayat Stables ranked in the top ten leading owners by purse money won in six of those years and always in the top 20 . Zayat has horses at all stages of the racing process , stallions , broodmares , young horses in training and active racing stock . His daughters were the inspiration for the names of two race horses , stakes-winner Point Ashley , who in turn inspired daughter Ashley 's costume jewelry business name ; and Littleprincessemma , dam of American Pharoah . Race horse Justin Phillip was named for Justin . The business base for the horse racing operation is Hackensack , New Jersey , but Zayat 's horses live in different locations across the US . His horse breeding stock live mostly in Kentucky , young horses are started in Florida . The racing stock have been in training with multiple trainers including Bob Baffert , Mark Casse , D. Wayne Lukas , Todd Pletcher , Dale Romans and others . Zayat Stables keeps about 30 broodmares and their foals in Kentucky along with roughly 20 yearlings . In 2015 the operation stood 13 breeding stallions at stud . Zayat typically retains a 25 % interest in the stallions he sends to stud , though in the case of Pioneerof the Nile , he kept a 75 % interest . As of 2015 , Zayat 's horses include American Pharoah and 13 other Grade I winners . These include : 2013 Breeders ' Cup runner and 2012 Haskell Invitational winner Paynter ; 2013 Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap winner Justin Phillip ; 2012 Arkansas Derby winner Bodemeister ; Pioneerof the Nile who won the 2008 CashCall Futurity and 2009 Santa Anita Derby ; three-time Grade I winner Zensational . He has entered horses in the Breeders ' Cup races 16 times , with his best result a fourth-place finish in 2007 . Zayat has experienced significant highs and lows in his quest for Triple Crown classic wins . Three times Zayat 's horses placed second in the Kentucky Derby . In 2009 , Zayat 's homebred Pioneerof the Nile started a streak of Zayat horses finishing second in the Kentucky Derby and other classic races when he was defeated by Mine That Bird . In 2010 , Zayat campaigned Eskendereya , winner of the Wood Memorial and considered the favorite for the Kentucky Derby . On the Sunday prior to the Derby , Eskendereya was withdrawn from the race and subsequently retired to stud due to a soft tissue injury that would have taken at least a year to heal . In 2011 , Zayat entered Nehro , who finished second to Animal Kingdom . In 2012 , Zayat Stables ' horses Bodemeister and then Paynter ran second in each of the three legs of the Triple Crown . Bodemeister finished a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I 'll Have Another . Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes , Zayat 's colt Paynter also finished second . Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis . Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse , and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation , Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013 . After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag # PowerUpPaynter , the horse developed a significant fan base , and received hundreds of get well cards , many from children . For his struggle to return to health , Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award . Zayat 's Triple Crown race losing-streak was finally broken by American Pharoah , who won the 2015 Kentucky Derby , the 2015 Preakness Stakes , and the 2015 Belmont Stakes , becoming the first horse to win the Triple Crown since 1978 . = = Litigation and related disputes = = Zayat has been described as \" controversial , \" and \" one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing \" by Joe Drape of the New York Times ; his success accompanied by a number of legal controversies . His racing stable survived Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings , and he faced a number of legal issues associated with his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing . = = = Bankruptcy = = = In December 2009 , Zayat was sued by Fifth Third Bank for an alleged $ 34 million in unpaid loans . He had taken out multiple loans from the bank totaling over $ 38 million between 2007 and 2009 . Fifth Third alleged that Zayat was in default because he failed to make two payments in 2009 . As part of the loan package , the bank had a security interest in Zayat Stables ' horses , prize money , stallion shares and stallion income . Further , the bank added an amended provision to its later loans stating , \" if Zayat Stables defaulted on any of the Notes , such default would be considered a default under all of the notes thereby entitling Fifth Third to accelerate the principal balance and all accrued interest due and owing under all of the Notes . \" While Zayat paid off some of the money owed , the bank contended that he remained in default on one loan . The bank alleged that Zayat had lost $ 52 million between 2006 and 2008 , that he had not reported a previous Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy he had filed under the name Ephraim David Zayat , and the bank attempted to foreclose on his horses . Zayat filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in February 2010 . He stated that the problem was that the Lexington branch of the bank worked with the Thoroughbred industry and was willing to restructure his loans , while the bank 's corporate headquarters in Cincinnati wanted to get out of the equine lending business altogether . Stating that Fifth Third was \" reneging on its promises , \" Zayat filed a countersuit in April 2010 , alleging the bank engaged in deceptive and predatory lending practices . When he thought the bank was willing to restructure its loans , Zayat withdrew 67 horses he intended to sell at Keeneland 's 2009 September and November sales and instead purchased 24 more yearlings . He had also paid Fifth Third $ 4.3 million from the proceeds of the sale of breeding rights to Zensational , all of which left him low on cash when the bank called in its loans . Zayat said the bank was using \" scorched earth \" tactics and accused it of trying to put him out of business , explaining that had he known the bank would not extend his loans , he would have sold enough horses to make his payments . All cases were resolved with a settlement agreement in July 2010 , seven months after the initial suit was filed . Zayat agreed to pay off his unsecured creditors over two years , without interest , and pay off Fifth Third by 2014 . Zayat Stables ' creditors unanimously approved the repayment plan . Zayat owed about $ 2.4 million to the Keeneland Association , and $ 1.2 million to other creditors including clinics , horse transport companies , boarding farms , and trainers \u2014 among them Bob Baffert . He also owed several horse breeders for stud fees . To settle his debts with Fifth Third , he agreed to annual payments based on a percentage of horse sales and proceeds from claiming races . As part of his reorganization plan , he was to sell a number of horses , including 100 % of his Grade I-winning horse Eskendereya . Ultimately , consistent with Zayat 's tendency to retain a financial interest in his stallions , he sold an undisclosed share in the stallion to Jess Jackson and retained some breeding rights . While the selling percentage and price were confidential , Zayat Stables ' reported income to the bankruptcy court for the month the deal closed was $ 7.5 million . Zayat stated , \" While Chapter 11 was a necessary step to take ... I look forward to carrying out our reorganization plan , and continuing to develop some of the best horses in the country . \" Zayat Stables successfully completed the bankruptcy reorganization plan , in the process his stable went from a high of 285 horses to a census of 118 in 2012 . = = = Gambling cases = = = Zayat 's bankruptcy revealed other problems . His bankruptcy documents listed four loans he had made to members of the Jelinsky family . Two members of that family , Michael and Jeffrey Jelinsky , had pleaded guilty in 2009 to illegal bookmaking . As a result , the racing commissions in California and Kentucky opened investigations on Zayat ; racing licensees are not to associate with bookmakers or convicted felons . Zayat claimed that he had no knowledge of the Jelinskys ' illegal acts . He stated that he thought the brothers were professional gamblers and that they had financial need . Further , he said he loaned them money because he knew their father and that the money they owed him was unrelated to gambling ; he stated that some of the money he loaned was to assist one of the brothers with a divorce . He was cleared in both states . Although New York also stated that they were investigating , there were no news reports of any adverse action . Zayat stated that he had been visited by federal agents who played tapes where the Jelinsky brothers discussed how they had cheated Zayat out of money by giving him bad betting advice . In an unrelated case , Zayat was mentioned in a 2013 lawsuit between Freehold Raceway and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority . The plaintiffs alleged that Zayat was allowed to bet on credit , which was a violation of state law . Zayat had been betting $ 200,000 a week through New Jersey 's online betting system , and the agency allowed him to \" float \" $ 286,000 in credit , \" as a courtesy . \" Zayat was not a party to the lawsuit and he paid off all debts owed to the Sports Authority . The records containing Zayat 's name were later redacted , but an internal email indicated that Zayat had wagered a total of at least $ 8.3 million . On March 10 , 2014 , a lawsuit against Zayat was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey . The plaintiff , Howard Rubinsky , was an associate of the Jelinskys who had also pleaded guilty in the illegal betting operation . His suit alleged breach of contract , claiming that Zayat failed to pay off a $ 1.65 million line of credit in 2004 . Rubinsky said he extended credit to Zayat with Tradewinds Sportsbook so Zayat could bet on horse races via a gambling website set up in Costa Rica . Zayat 's lawyer described the suit as \" a meritless claim \" , filed a motion to dismiss in 2015 alleging lack of evidence , and argued that the statute of limitations of six years had run . Zayat stated in court documents that he had met and loaned money to Rubinsky , but said , \" I can say unequivocally that I did not give Mr. Rubinsky any money as payment on any debt ... I agreed to give him money because he told me he was ill and broke . \" On June 4 , 2015 , a federal judge in Newark , New Jersey , dismissed Rubinsky 's lawsuit , citing both Rubinsky 's difficulty in proving his case and the expired statute of limitations . In a related matter , June 1 , 2015 , days before American Pharoah was to run in the 2015 Belmont Stakes , the New York Times reported that Rubinsky 's lawyer , Joseph Bainton , filed a $ 10-million libel suit against Zayat for comments to the press , including the characterization of Rubinsky 's other lawsuit as \" extortion , a fraud and blackmail . \" That suit was dismissed on August 5 , 2015 . In a post-race press conference after winning the 2015 Belmont Stakes , Zayat stated that he was so anxious about American Pharoah 's upcoming race that he neglected to bet on anything .",

                    "text": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A. Richardson , Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Sanborn Contracts- 1874 ) ( Resigned and appointed Federal Judge by Grant . ) George H. Williams , Attorney General \u2013 ( Pratt & Boyd- 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Columbus Delano , Secretary of Interior \u2013 ( Bogus Agents \u2013 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Orville E. Babcock , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Black Friday \u2013 1869 ) ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Safe Burglary Conspiracy \u2013 1876 ) ( Acquitted in Saint Louis Whiskey Ring trials by jury due to Grant 's defense testimony in his favor . ) John McDonald , Internal Revenue Supervisor , St. Louis \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Indicted and convicted ; served prison time ; claimed Grant was involved in the Whiskey Ring but did not supply any evidence . ) Horace Porter , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) William W. Belknap , Secretary of War \u2013 ( Trading Post Ring- 1876 ) ( Resigned ; Convicted by House ; acquitted by Senate ; indictments against Belknap in Washington D.C. court were dropped by judge at request of Grant and Attorney General Alphonso Taft . ) George M. Robeson , Secretary of Navy \u2013 ( Naval Department Ring- 1876 ) ( Grant defended Robeson in State of the Union address . Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P. Bradley \u2013 1870 Ward Hunt \u2013 1873 Morrison Remick Waite ( Chief Justice ) \u2013 1874 = = = States admitted to the Union = = = Colorado \u2013 August 1 , 1876 Colorado came into the Union just in time to give enough electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

                    "text": "Banded houndshark = The banded houndshark ( Triakis scyllium ) is a species of houndshark , in the family Triakidae , common in the northwestern Pacific Ocean from the southern Russian Far East to Taiwan . Found on or near the bottom , it favors shallow coastal habitats with sandy or vegetated bottoms , and also enters brackish water . This shark reaches 1.5 m ( 4.9 ft ) in length . It has a short , rounded snout and mostly narrow fins ; the pectoral fins are broad and triangular , and the trailing margin of the first dorsal fin is almost vertical . It is gray above and lighter below ; younger sharks have darker saddles and dots , which fade with age . Nocturnal and largely solitary , the banded houndshark preys on benthic invertebrates and bony fishes . It is aplacental viviparous , with the developing embryos sustained by yolk . After mating during summer , females bear as many as 42 pups following a gestation period of 9 \u2013 12 months . The banded houndshark poses no danger to humans and adapts well to captivity . It is caught as bycatch off Japan , Taiwan , and likely elsewhere in its range ; it may be eaten but is not as well-regarded as related species . Because fishing does not appear to have diminished this shark 's population , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it under Least Concern . = = Taxonomy = = The first scientific description of the banded houndshark was authored by German biologists Johannes Peter M\u00fcller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle , based on a dried specimen from Japan , in their 1838 \u2013 41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen . They gave it the specific epithet scyllium , derived from the Ancient Greek skylion ( \" dogfish \" ) , and placed it in the genus Triakis . Within the genus , it is placed in the subgenus Triakis along with the leopard shark ( T. ( Triakis ) semifasciata ) . = = Distribution and habitat = = Native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean , the banded houndshark occurs from the southern Russian Far East to Taiwan , including Japan , Korea , and eastern China ; records from the Philippines are questionable . This common , benthic shark is found over continental and insular shelves , mostly close to shore but also to a depth of 150 m ( 490 ft ) . It frequents sandy flats and beds of seaweed and eelgrass ; additionally it is tolerant of brackish water and enters estuaries and bays . = = Description = = The banded houndshark is a moderately slender-bodied species growing up to 1.5 m ( 4.9 ft ) long . The snout is short , broad , and rounded ; the widely separated nostrils are each preceded by a lobe of skin that does not reach the mouth . The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head ; they are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) and have prominent ridges underneath . The mouth forms a short , wide arch and bears long furrows at the corners that extend onto both jaws . Each tooth has an upright to oblique knife-like central cusp flanked by strong cusplets . There are five pairs of gill slits . Most of the fins are fairly narrow ; in adults the pectoral fins are broad and roughly triangular . The moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about halfway between the pectoral and pelvic fins , and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex . The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters as high as the first and larger than the anal fin . The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe ; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct . This species is gray above , with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age ; the underside is off-white . = = Biology and ecology = = The banded houndshark is nocturnal and generally solitary , though several individuals may rest together , sometimes piled atop one another inside a cave . It feeds mainly on crustaceans ( including shrimps , crabs , hermit crabs , and mantis shrimps ) , cephalopods ( including octopus ) , and spoon worms ; polychaete worms , tunicates , peanut worms , and small , bottom-living bony fishes ( including flatfishes , conger eels , herring , jacks , drums , and grunts ) are occasionally consumed . Shrimp and spoon worms are important prey for sharks up to 70 cm ( 28 in ) long ; cephalopods predominate in the diets of larger sharks . Mating occurs during the summer , and involves the male swimming parallel to the female and gripping her pectoral fin with his teeth ; thus secured , he then twists the aft portion of his body to insert a single clasper into her cloaca for copulation . The banded houndshark is aplacental viviparous , in which the developing embryos are sustained to birth by yolk . Females bear litters of 9 \u2013 26 pups after a gestation period of 9 \u2013 12 months , though litters as large as 42 pups have been recorded . The newborns measure 18 \u2013 20 cm ( 7.1 \u2013 7.9 in ) long . Males mature sexually at 5 \u2013 6 years old , when they are 93 \u2013 106 cm ( 37 \u2013 42 in ) long , and live up to 15 years . Females mature sexually at 6 \u2013 7 years old , when they are 106 \u2013 107 cm ( 42 \u2013 42 in ) long , and live up to 18 years . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus gracilis , Onchobothrium triacis , and Phyllobothrium serratum , the leech Stibarobdella macrothela , and the copepods Achtheinus impenderus , Caligus punctatus , Kroyeria triakos , and Pseudopandarus scyllii . = = Human interactions = = Harmless to humans , the banded houndshark is commonly displayed in public aquariums in China and Japan , and has reproduced in captivity . Individuals have survived in captivity for over five years . This species is often caught incidentally off Japan in gillnets and set nets ; the meat is sometimes sold , but is considered to be of poorer quality than that of other houndsharks in the region . It is caught in lesser numbers off Taiwan , and is probably also fished off Korea and northern China . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the banded houndshark under Least Concern , as it remains abundant throughout its range . Off Japan , it can be found in rocky areas that provide refuge from fishing pressure .",

                    "text": "Coral catshark = The coral catshark ( Atelomycterus marmoratus ) is a species of catshark , and part of the family Scyliorhinidae . It is common on shallow coral reefs across the Indo-West Pacific , from Pakistan to New Guinea . Reaching up to 70 cm ( 28 in ) in length , the coral catshark has an extremely slender body , a short head and tail , and two dorsal fins that are angled backwards . It can be identified by the numerous black and white spots on its back , sides , and fins , which often merge to form horizontal bars . Furthermore , adult males have distinctively long and thin claspers . Reclusive and inactive during the day , at dusk and at night the coral catshark actively forages for small , bottom-living invertebrates and bony fishes . Its slender form allows it to access tight spaces on the reef . It is oviparous : females lay purse-shaped egg capsules two at a time on the bottom , and the young hatch after 4 \u2013 6 months . This small , harmless shark adapts well to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium ; it is regarded as one of the most suitable shark species for private aquarists . The coral catshark is a minor bycatch of reef fisheries , with minimal commercial value . There is increasing fishing activity and extensive habitat degradation within its range , leading to concern over its population and its assessment as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . = = Taxonomy = = The coral catshark was first described by an anonymous author , usually referred to English zoologist Edward Turner Bennett , in the 1830 Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles . Its original name was Scyllium marmoratum , from the Latin marmoratus meaning \" marbled \" . Hence , another common name for this species is marbled catshark . In 1913 , Samuel Garman placed it in his newly created genus Atelomycterus . The type specimen was caught off Sumatra and is suspected to have been lost . = = Description = = The coral catshark has a very slender , cylindrical , firm body and a short , narrow head . The snout is short and slightly flattened , with a blunt tip . The eyes are horizontally oval and protected by rudimentary nictitating membranes ; behind are spiracles of moderate size . The large nostrils are mostly covered by broad , triangular flaps of skin on their anterior margins , leaving small incurrent and excurrent openings . The nasal flaps reach the mouth , obscuring a pair of broad grooves connecting the excurrent openings and the mouth . The long , angular mouth has very long furrows at the corners extending onto both the upper and lower jaws . The small teeth have a narrow central cusp flanked by 1 \u2013 2 cusplets on both sides . There are five pairs of gill slits . The pectoral fins are fairly large . The first dorsal fin is angled backwards and originates over the rear of the pelvic fin bases ; the second dorsal fin is similarly shaped and slightly smaller than the first , and originates over the front quarter of the anal fin base . Adult males have thin , tapering claspers that extend about two-thirds of the distance between the pelvic and anal fins . The anal fin is much smaller than the dorsal fins . The caudal fin is relatively short and broad , with an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles . Extremely variable in coloration , the coral catshark lacks prominent saddle markings but rather has many black and white spots on a grayish background . These spots often run together to form horizontal dashes , which include white tips on the dorsal fins and a white stripe through the gill slits . The underside is plain white . This species grows up to 70 cm ( 28 in ) long . = = Distribution and habitat = = The most widely distributed member of its genus , the coral catshark can be found from Pakistan and India to Southeast Asia and Taiwan , including the Philippines and New Guinea . Its range extends as far north as the Ryukyu Islands . Early records from Australian waters are in fact of the related Australian marbled catshark ( A. macleayi ) and banded sand catshark ( A. fasciatus ) . Common and bottom-dwelling in nature , the coral catshark inhabits inshore coral reefs at depths not exceeding 15 m ( 49 ft ) . = = Biology and ecology = = The elongated body of the coral catshark allows it to move into and through small spaces in the reef environment , though it does not \" crawl \" using its pectoral and pelvic fins like the epaulette shark ( Hemiscyllium ocellatum ) . It is primarily crepuscular and nocturnal , with active foraging activity beginning in the afternoon and ending before sunrise . During the day , it generally hides under shelter such as reef overhangs or sunken logs , either singly or in groups . Individual sharks may return to the same hiding place on successive days . This species feeds on small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes ; captive specimens have been observed lying still and lunging at prey that come into range . The coral catshark is oviparous , with the female producing eggs two at a time . Each egg is enclosed in a purse-shaped capsule roughly 6 \u2013 8 cm ( 2.4 \u2013 3.1 in ) long and 2 cm ( 0.79 in ) wide , with two constricted \" waists \" ; one end of the capsule is squared off while the other bears two short \" horns \" that may terminate in short tendrils . The female deposits the eggs on the bottom , rather than attaching them to vertical structures . The capsule is light brown when freshly laid and darkens over time . The eggs hatch in 4 \u2013 6 months at 26 \u00b0 C ( 79 \u00b0 F ) . Newly hatched sharks measure 10 \u2013 13 cm ( 3.9 \u2013 5.1 in ) long and have a contrasting dorsal pattern of light and dark vertical bars , sometimes with black and white dots . At three months old , the young have grown by 4 \u2013 5 cm ( 1.6 \u2013 2.0 in ) and their coloration has faded to match that of the adults . Males and females attain sexual maturity at around 47 \u2013 62 cm ( 19 \u2013 24 in ) and 49 \u2013 57 cm ( 19 \u2013 22 in ) respectively . = = Human interactions = = Common in the aquarium trade , the coral catshark is regarded as well-suited to home aquariums because of its small size , hardiness , and attractive appearance . It requires a tank at least 2 metres long , with sufficiently deep hiding places . This shark tends to be more aggressive than other small sharks , often attacking tankmates larger than it can consume . Captive individuals have been known to live up to 20 years , and the species has reproduced in the aquarium . Small numbers of coral catsharks are caught incidentally by artisanal reef fishers in eastern Indonesia and likely elsewhere ; it may be sold for meat or processed for fishmeal and liver oil , but its size limits its economic importance . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Near Threatened , and notes that with more data it may meet the criteria for Vulnerable . It is likely threatened by the rising fishing pressure throughout its range , as well as by widespread habitat degradation from blast fishing , pollution , and the mining of coral for use as building material .",

                    "text": "Diamond stingray = The diamond stingray ( Dasyatis dipterura ) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae . It is found in the coastal waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile , and around the Gal\u00e1pagos and Hawaiian Islands . This bottom-dweller generally inhabits sandy or muddy flats near rocky reefs and kelp forests , to a depth of 30 m ( 98 ft ) , though off Hawaii it may range considerably deeper . As its common name suggests , this species has an angular , diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc that is plain brown or gray above , with rows of tubercles along the midline and on the \" shoulders \" . The long , whip-like tail has both dorsal and ventral fin folds , which distinguish this ray from the closely similar longtail stingray ( D. longa ) . It typically grows to 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) across . When searching for food , diamond stingrays may form groups of up to hundreds of individuals . It is most active at night and preys mainly on burrowing invertebrates and small bony fishes , which are extracted from the bottom via suction or digging . This species is aplacental viviparous : once the embryos exhaust their yolk supply , they are nourished by histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" ) produced by the mother . Females bear 1 \u2013 4 pups every summer in estuaries ; mating is followed by a ten-month period of either sperm storage or arrested embryonic development , after which the embryos rapidly mature over 2 \u2013 3 months . The slowest-growing stingray known , this species is not resilient against fishing pressure . It is caught for food by artisanal fishers in Latin America , particularly in Mexico where it is one of the most economically important rays . This has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in Mexico by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , while the species as a whole is listed as Data Deficient . Though innocuous towards humans , the diamond stingray 's long , venomous tail spine is potentially dangerous . = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = In 1880 , the diamond stingray was described twice by three American ichthyologists : as Dasybatus dipterurus by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in Proceedings of the United States National Museum , and as Trygon brevis by Samuel Garman in Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology . Jordan and Gilbert 's account was published in May while Garman 's was published in October , making dipterurus ( feminine dipterura ) the correct name as it was published first . However , when Garman synonymized the two in 1913 he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis , leading to long-standing confusion . Both Dasybatus and Trygon were later synonymized with the genus Dasyatis , but many authors still listed D. brevis in place of or in addition to D. dipterura . Garman also synonymized the Hawaiian stingray ( D. hawaiensis ) with D. dipterura in 1913 , which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation . The species syntypes were collected from San Diego Bay , California . The specific epithet dipterura is derived from the Latin di ( \" two \" ) , ptero ( \" wing \" ) , and ura ( \" tail \" ) , referring to the fin folds on both sides of its tail . Rat-tailed stingray is a former common name for this species . Lisa Rosenberger 's 2001 phylogenetic analysis , based on morphology , determined the diamond stingray and the bluntnose stingray ( D. say ) of the western Atlantic Ocean to be sister species , that likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama ( c . 3 Ma ) . In addition , the two were found to be the second-most basal taxa in their genus , after the common stingray ( D. pastinaca ) . = = Distribution and habitat = = The diamond stingray is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile , as well as around the Gal\u00e1pagos and Hawaiian Islands ; it is very abundant around Baja California and in the Gulf of California . At the northern and southern extremes of its range , it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by El Ni\u00f1o . There is a record of this ray from off British Columbia , which is unconfirmed and would be highly anomalous as it is known to be a tropical and warm-temperate species . A bottom-dwelling inhabitant of inshore waters , the diamond stingray favors sandy or muddy bottoms , often near rocky reefs or kelp forests . Off southern California , it usually occurs from the intertidal zone to a depth of 7 m ( 23 ft ) during the summer , shifting to depths of 13 \u2013 18 m ( 43 \u2013 59 ft ) during late fall and winter . For unknown reasons , it prefers to overwinter in kelp forests rather than sandy flats . Off Chile , the diamond stingray occurs at a similar depth of 3 \u2013 30 m ( 10 \u2013 100 ft ) . On the other hand , this species has been reported from as far down as 355 m ( 1,165 ft ) off Hawaii , which if accurate would suggest that it utilizes a much greater range of depths than previously realized . = = Description = = The diamond stingray attains a disc width of 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) or possibly 1.2 m ( 3.9 ft ) ; females grow larger than males . Its pectoral fin disc is rhomboid in shape , slightly wider than long , with angular outer corners and subtly convex margins . The snout is blunt-angled and non-projecting . The eyes are fairly large and immediately followed by the spiracles ( paired respiratory openings ) . The mouth is strongly curved , containing 21 \u2013 37 upper tooth rows and 23 \u2013 44 lower tooth rows ; the teeth are small and blunt , and arranged into flattened surfaces . Three or five papillae ( nipple-like structures ) are found in a row across the floor of the mouth . The whip-like tail generally measures up to one and half times the length of the disc , and bears one ( more if replacements have grown in ) long , slender , serrated spine on the upper surface , closer to the base than the tip . Behind the spine , there are long dorsal and ventral fin folds that rise gradually , reaching a relatively high apex before sloping down abruptly . The presence of the upper fin fold separates this species from the similar longtail stingray ( D. longa ) , which shares most of its range . However , the tail is often damaged , in which case differentiating the two species in the field becomes all but impossible . Young rays have completely smooth skin , while adults develop a row of low tubercles along the midline of the back , flanked by two shorter rows on the \" shoulders \" . The tail also becomes covered in prickles . This species is a uniform olive to brown to gray above , darkening to black on the tail , and off-white below . = = Biology and ecology = = The diamond stingray is most active at night , spending much of the day buried in sand with only its eyes protruding . When foraging for food , it may be solitary but more commonly forms groups numbering up to the hundreds . There is strong segregation by sex and age . This species feeds on crustaceans , molluscs , and other invertebrates , as well as small bony fishes ; its powerful jaws and molar-like teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey . It mainly targets burrowing organisms , but may also take prey exposed on the bottom . There is a record of a female 69 cm ( 27 in ) across , that had gorged herself on at least 30 small crabs . In the Bah\u00eda Magdalena lagoon complex , Baja California Sur , its most important source of food are pea crabs , followed by the razor clam Solyema valvulus , and then polychaete worms . The typical hunting strategy of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor , landing atop any prey encountered . It then quickly levers its body up-and-down with its disc , producing negative pressure to extract the prey from its burrow . This ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc and spitting jets of water , so as to uncover buried prey . Diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes , including Mexican hogfish ( Bodianus diplotaenia ) , Galapagos porgies ( Calamus taurinus ) , greybar grunts ( Haemulon sexfasciatum ) , spinster wrasses ( Halichoeres nichols ) , and long-spine porcupinefish ( Diodon holocanthus ) , which take advantage of the invertebrates stirred up by the ray 's activities . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bullardi , A. dasi , A. rajivi , and A. soberoni , Anthocephalum currani , Parachristianella tiygonis , and Pseudochristianello elegantissima , the flukes Anaporrhutum euzeti and Probolitrema mexicana , and the monogenean Listrocephalos kearni . Like other stingrays , the diamond stingray is aplacental viviparous : the embryos are initially nourished by yolk , and later by histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" , rich in proteins and lipids ) produced by the mother . Only the left ovary and uterus are functional in adult females . Several bays along the Pacific coast of Baja California are known to serve as nurseries . Most of the life history information available on this species has come from Bah\u00eda Magdalena , where females bear one litter of 1 \u2013 4 pups per year . Courtship and mating occurs in late summer from July to August , but due to a ten-month period of either sperm storage or diapause ( wherein the embryo becomes dormant ) , embryonic development does not begin until the following year and is completed within 2 \u2013 3 months . Birthing takes place in summer from July to September in shallow estuaries ; the newborns measure 18 \u2013 23 cm ( 7.1 \u2013 9.1 in ) across . During El Ni\u00f1o years , the higher temperatures appear to shift the timing of birth forward . The diamond stingray has the lowest growth rate of any stingray species yet studied . Males reach sexual maturity at around 43 \u2013 47 cm ( 17 \u2013 19 in ) across and 7 years of age , while females grow slower still , reaching maturity at around 57 \u2013 66 cm ( 22 \u2013 26 in ) across and 10 years of age . The maximum lifespan has been estimated at least 19 years for males and 28 years for females . = = Human interactions = = At least one fatality off southern California has resulted from the long , venomous tail spine of the diamond stingray . However , it is not aggressive and will usually flee given the opportunity . This ray is not found off the United States in sufficient numbers to be economically important . Elsewhere in its range , it is caught in substantial numbers for human consumption , both intentionally and as bycatch ; the pectoral fins or \" wings \" are sold fresh or filleted and salted . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) notes that the diamond stingray 's low reproductive productivity renders it susceptible to population depletion , but currently lacks enough biological and fishery data to assess it beyond Data Deficient overall , or in the U.S. , Central , and South American parts of its range . In Mexico , the diamond stingray is one of the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries , comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch . Its significance is likely underestimated , as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data . It is mainly caught during summer and fall , being the most common ray landed in Bah\u00eda Magdalena , and second most common ray landed off Sonora state . Demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed ; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines , with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bah\u00eda Magdalena catch in 1998 \u2013 2000 . This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls , on longlines , and in fish traps . In the future , habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region . As a result of these pressures , the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters . No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species .",

                    "text": "Kitefin shark = The kitefin shark or seal shark ( Dalatias licha ) is a species of dogfish shark in the family Dalatiidae , and the only species in its genus . It is found sporadically around the world , usually close to the sea floor at depths of 200 \u2013 600 m ( 660 \u2013 1,970 ft ) . With a sizable oil-filled liver to maintain neutral buoyancy , this shark is able to cruise slowly through the water while expending little energy . The kitefin shark has a slender body with a very short , blunt snout , large eyes , and thick lips . Its teeth are highly differentiated between the upper and lower jaws , with the upper teeth small and narrow and the lower teeth large , triangular , and serrated . Its typical length is 1.0 \u2013 1.4 m ( 3.3 \u2013 4.6 ft ) . Armed with large teeth and a strong bite , the kitefin shark is a powerful , solitary predator that takes many different types of prey , ranging from bony fishes , sharks and rays , to cephalopods , crustaceans , polychaete worms , siphonophores , and possibly carrion . It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself , similar to its smaller relative , the cookiecutter shark ( Isistius brasiliensis ) . This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 10 \u2013 14 young . The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat , skin , and liver oil , primarily by Portugal and Japan . A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s , but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices ; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock is often cited as an example of the susceptibility of deep-sea sharks to human exploitation . The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to overfishing and , coupled with known population declines , has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . = = Taxonomy = = The kitefin shark was originally described as Squalus licha by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre , in his 1788 Tableau encyclop\u00e9dique et m\u00e9thodique des trois regnes de la nature ; the type specimen from \" Le cap Breton \" has since been lost . This species was later placed in its own genus , Dalatias , which came from the synonymy of Constantine Rafinesque 's 1810 Dalatias sparophagus with S. licha . However , some authorities dispute this on the grounds that D. sparophagus is a nomen dubium , and prefer to use the next available genus name Scymnorhinus . The genus name Dalatias is derived from the Greek dalos or dalou , meaning \" torch \" . The specific epithet licha comes from la liche , the French name for this shark . Additional common names used for the kitefin shark include black shark and darkie Charlie . = = Phylogeny and evolution = = Cladistic studies have consistently found that the closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks ( Isistius ) , with which they share several dentitional , skeletal , and muscular similarities . Dalatias and Isistius are believed to have evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods ( 65.5 Ma ) , as part of a larger adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats . The oldest fossil teeth that definitively belong to the kitefin shark date to the Middle Eocene epoch , such as those recovered from Bortonian-stage deposits ( 43.0 \u2013 37.0 Ma ) in New Zealand . Dalatias fossil teeth dating to various ages have also been discovered in Europe , the former USSR , Japan , and western India . The fossil material now recognized as belonging to this species were historically described under a multitude of different names . = = Description = = The kitefin shark has a moderately elongated body with a very short , rounded snout . The eyes and spiracles are large . The lips are thick with pleats or fringes , though are not modified to be suctorial . There are 16 \u2013 21 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 17 \u2013 20 tooth rows in the lower jaw . The upper teeth are small and spike-shaped , curving slightly towards the corners of the mouth . The lower teeth are very large , knife-shaped , and serrated , with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface . The first dorsal fin is slightly smaller and shorter-based than the second , and neither has spines . The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins , while the second originates above the middle of the pelvic fin bases . The pectoral fins are short and rounded . The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well-developed notch near the tip , and a barely present lower lobe . The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish ( Centroscymnus coelolepis ) , from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines . The dermal denticles are small and flat , with a single horizontal ridge ending in a point . The coloration is a uniform dark brown or gray , sometimes with faint black spots on the back . The fins have white or translucent trailing edges , and the tip of the caudal fin is black . An 90 cm ( 3.0 ft ) long kitefin shark with partial albinism , lacking pigment on 59 % of its body , was caught in the Gulf of Genoa in 2003 . Unlike in a previous case of an albino Portuguese dogfish , the abnormal coloration of this individual had not diminished its ability to capture prey . Most kitefin sharks are 1.0 \u2013 1.4 m ( 3.3 \u2013 4.6 ft ) long and weigh 8 kg ( 18 lb ) ; the maximum reported length is 1.6 m ( 5.2 ft ) , possibly 1.8 m ( 5.9 ft ) . = = Distribution and habitat = = The kitefin shark has an almost circumglobal range in tropical and warm-temperature waters , consisting of a number of widely separated populations with likely little interchange between them . This shark has not been reported from the eastern Pacific and northern Indian Oceans . In the northern Atlantic , it occurs in the Georges Bank and the northern Gulf of Mexico , and from the North Sea to Cameroon , including around the British Isles , in the western and central Mediterranean Sea , and off Madeira and the Azores . In the Indian Ocean , it is found off South Africa and Mozambique . In the Pacific , it occurs off Japan , Java , Australia and New Zealand , and the Hawaiian Islands . There is a single record of this species in the southern Atlantic , from off southern Brazil . An offshore , deepwater species , the kitefin shark is most common at a depth of 200 \u2013 600 m ( 660 \u2013 1,970 ft ) , but has been captured from the surface to as deep as 1,800 m ( 5,900 ft ) . Off the Azores this shark segregates by sex , with females most common around a depth of 230 m ( 750 ft ) and males most common around 412 \u2013 448 m ( 1,352 \u2013 1,470 ft ) . The kitefin shark inhabits the outer continental shelves and upper continental slopes , and is also found around oceanic islands and seamounts . It is the only member of its family that tends to be found close to the sea floor as opposed to in the middle of the water column , though on occasion it has been captured well above the bottom . = = Biology and ecology = = Relatively common where it occurs , kitefin sharks are usually solitary in nature but may form small groups . It is a slow swimmer with a large liver filled with squalene , a lipid less dense than water , allowing it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover above the bottom with little effort . Studies off the coast of North Africa and in the Gulf of Genoa have found males outnumbering females by 2 : 1 and 5 : 1 respectively ; this imbalanced sex ratio has not been observed off South Africa and may reflect sampling bias . The kitefin shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks , as well as by sperm whales ( Physeter macrocephalus ) . Parasite data on this species is limited ; an examination of two sharks caught off Ireland found three nematodes in the stomach lumen . One could be identified as Anisakis simplex L3 , while another may have been a larval Raphidascaris . A powerful and versatile deepwater predator , the short , robust jaws of the kitefin shark give it an enormously strong bite . It feeds mainly on bony fishes ( including deepwater smelts , viperfishes , scaly dragonfishes , barracudinas , greeneyes , lanternfishes , bristlemouths , cod and other gadids , grenadiers , deepwater scorpionfishes , bonito , snake mackerels , deepwater cardinalfishes , and sea toads ) , but also takes a wide variety of other animals , including skates , smaller sharks ( Galeus , Squalus , Etmopterus and Centrophorus ) , squid and octopus , crustaceans ( amphipods , isopods , shrimp and lobsters ) , polychaete worms , and siphonophores . Like the related cookiecutter shark , the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself , including other sharks and whales . The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge , or have some other means of capturing faster prey . In the Mediterranean , bony fishes are the most important food year-round , with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring , crustaceans in the summer , and cephalopods in the fall . Captured males are more likely to have full stomachs than females for unknown reasons . Reproduction in the kitefin shark is aplacental viviparous , with the embryos hatching inside the uterus and being sustained to term by yolk . Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteruses ; the uterus is not divided into compartments . In the Mediterranean , breeding occurs throughout the year with peaks in spring and fall ; females may have a year of rest in between pregnancies . The litter size is 10 \u2013 16 , increasing with female size . The young are born at a length of 30 \u2013 45 cm ( 12 \u2013 18 in ) , varying by geographic location , after a possible gestation period of two years . The males mature sexually at a length of 77 \u2013 121 cm ( 2.53 \u2013 3.97 ft ) , and the females at a length of 117 \u2013 159 cm ( 3.84 \u2013 5.22 ft ) . There is no relationship between an individual 's size at birth , size at maturity , and maximum size . = = Human interactions = = The kitefin shark inhabits depths too great for it to be a danger to humans . Its upper teeth have been found lodged in underwater fiberoptic cables . This species has a long history of human exploitation : the meat is consumed in the eastern Atlantic and Japan , and the offal processed into fishmeal . The liver oil is utilized in Portugal , Japan , and South Africa . The skin is made into a type of shagreen useful in the making of furniture and jewelry , and is also favored for the manufacture of \" boroso \" , a Spanish polished leather . This shark has no commercial value in the western Atlantic . The continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into the deep sea has raised concerns about the vulnerability of this and other deepwater shark species to overfishing , as these sharks have slow growth and reproductive rates . This is exemplified by the rapid stock depletion and collapse of the Azores kitefin shark fishery . This targeted fishery began in the early 1970s for the production of liver oil . In the early 1980s , the fishing fleet was enlarged with the addition of industrial vessels equipped with demersal gillnets , resulting in a fishery peak in 1984 of 937 tons landed . After 1991 , kitefin shark catches declined precipitously to under 15 tons annually which , along with a drop in the global price of liver oil , led to the fishery becoming unprofitable by the end of the decade . A population assessment has suggested that the northeastern Atlantic stock had fallen to 50 % of the pre-exploitation biomass . Fisheries operating off Portugal and Japan are responsible for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark , generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line . Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003 . In other areas of the northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species ; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles , where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94 % since the 1970s . In the Mediterranean , this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries . Although it is generally discarded alive , many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive . In the Southern Hemisphere , catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content ; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas . New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997 . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide , and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines .",

                    "text": "Viper dogfish = The viper dogfish or viper shark ( Trigonognathus kabeyai ) is a rare species of dogfish shark in the family Etmopteridae , and the only extant member of its genus . It has been found in the Pacific Ocean off southern Japan , the Bonin Islands , and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands . This species inhabits upper continental slopes and seamounts . It may migrate vertically , shifting between bottom waters 270 \u2013 360 m ( 890 \u2013 1,180 ft ) deep during the day and upper waters less than 150 m ( 490 ft ) deep at night . A slender , black shark reaching 54 cm ( 21 in ) in length , the viper dogfish can be recognized by its narrow , triangular jaws and well-spaced , fang-like teeth . It also has two spined dorsal fins , dermal denticles with faceted crowns , and numerous light-emitting photophores concentrated on its ventral surface . Feeding mainly on bony fishes , the viper dogfish captures prey by protruding its jaws and impaling them with its teeth . Its impressive gape allows it to swallow relatively large fish whole . The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism , which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks . This shark gives birth to live young , which are nourished by yolk during gestation ; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups . Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls . The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species . = = Taxonomy = = The first specimens of the viper dogfish were two immature males caught off southern Japan by the bottom trawler Seiryo-Maru in 1986 . The first , designated as the holotype , measured 22 cm ( 8.7 in ) long and was collected off Cape Shiono at a depth of 330 m ( 1,080 ft ) . The second measured 37 cm ( 15 in ) long and was collected off Hiwasa , Tokushima at a depth of 360 m ( 1,180 ft ) . The shark was described as a new species and genus by University of Tokyo researchers Kenji Mochizuki and Fumio Ohe in a 1990 article for the Japanese Journal of Ichthyology . They gave it the name Trigonognathus kabeyai ; the generic name is derived from the Greek trigonon ( \" triangle \" ) and gnathus ( \" jaw \" ) , while the specific name honors Hiromichi Kabeya , the captain of the Seiryo-Maru . Mochizuki and Ohe originally assigned the viper dogfish to the family Squalidae , which at the time was used for all members of the order Squaliformes aside from the bramble and rough sharks . In a 1992 morphological study , Shigeru Shirai and Osamu Okamura placed this species in the squalid subfamily Etmopterinae , which most taxonomists now recognize as the separate family Etmopteridae . = = Phylogeny and evolution = = The position of Trigonognathus within the Etmopteridae is uncertain . Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data generally support the subdivision of the Etmopteridae into two clades , one consisting of Etmopterus and Miroscyllium and the other consisting of Centroscyllium and Aculeola . Phylogenetic analyses have variously placed Trigonognathus as closer to one clade or the other or as basal to both , depending on which morphological characters , nuclear DNA markers , and / or mitochondrial DNA markers were used . Based on molecular clock estimation , Trigonognathus is thought to have originated around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene , as part of a larger evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera . The genus is represented in this time period by the extinct species T. virginiae , whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age ( 47.8 \u2013 41.3 Mya ) strata in Landes , southwestern France . Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela , which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene ( 11.6 \u2013 3.6 Mya ) . = = Description = = The viper dogfish has a slender , cylindrical body and a moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout . Behind the large oval eyes are narrow , elliptical spiracles . The nostrils are nearly vertical slits . The jaws are long and narrowly triangular , and can be protruded from the head . The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced ; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise . Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side , along with a single tooth row at the upper and lower symphyses ( jaw midpoints ) . The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth . When the mouth is closed , the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower , while the lateral teeth interlock . Five gill slits are seen , with the fifth pair longer than the others . The fins are small and very thin . The pectoral fins are rounded and lobe-like . The two dorsal fins are positioned about between the pectoral and pelvic fins . Each dorsal fin bears a slightly grooved spine in front ; the second dorsal spine is longer than the first . The anal fin is absent , and the caudal peduncle lacks keels or notches . The upper lobe of the caudal fin is larger than the lower and has a notch in the trailing margin . The skin , excluding on the fins , is densely covered with irregularly arranged , nonoverlapping dermal denticles . Each denticle has a swollen rhombic shape with 10 \u2013 40 facets on the crown . The viper dogfish is black with distinct darker markings on the underside . These markings contain large numbers of tiny light-producing photophores ; more photophores are found sparsely scattered over the rest of the body , as well as in a translucent patch on the upper eyelid . The fins are translucent , and the tip of the caudal fin upper lobe is blackish . The largest known male is 47 cm ( 19 in ) long and weighs 0.43 kg ( 0.95 lb ) , and the largest female is 54 cm ( 21 in ) long and weighs 0.76 kg ( 1.7 lb ) . = = Distribution and habitat = = Most specimens of the viper dogfish have been collected from a relatively small area of the northwestern Pacific Ocean off the Kii Peninsula in Japan . A number of specimens were also recovered from the stomachs of predatory fishes caught in the Bonin Islands . One specimen was caught from the Hancock Seamount , located some 300 km ( 190 mi ) northwest of Kure Atoll in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands . During the day , this species has been caught close to the bottom on the upper reaches of continental slopes and seamounts , at depths of 270 \u2013 360 m ( 890 \u2013 1,180 ft ) . At night , it has been caught between the surface and a depth of 150 m ( 490 ft ) in water over 1.5 km ( 0.93 mi ) deep . This pattern suggests the viper dogfish performs a diel vertical migration , spending the day in deeper water and rising towards the surface at night ; such daily movement may relate to feeding . = = Biology and ecology = = The viper dogfish feeds primarily on bony fishes , notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus , and also takes crustaceans . Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting , in contrast to the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat . Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole ; the shark can consume fish close to 40 % as long as itself . The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle , which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting . Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone , which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward . This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws , as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally . Known predators of the viper dogfish include the bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) and the sickle pomfret ( Taractichthys steindachneri ) . Like other members of its family , this species is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term by yolk . Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteri . Two of the recorded female specimens contained 25 and 26 mature ova ; in the related black dogfish ( Centroscyllium fabricii ) , the number of mature ova in a female is slightly greater than the number of resulting embryos , which suggests a litter size under 26 in the viper dogfish . Males and females mature sexually at roughly 43 and 52 cm ( 17 and 20 in ) long , respectively . = = Human interactions = = The viper dogfish has no economic value . It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species , though what effect , if any , fishing has on its population is unknown . As a result , the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient .",

                    "text": "Winghead shark = The winghead shark ( Eusphyra blochii ) is a species of hammerhead shark , and part of the family Sphyrnidae . Reaching a length of 1.9 m ( 6.2 ft ) , this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall , sickle-shaped first dorsal fin . Its name comes from its exceptionally large \" hammer \" , or cephalofoil , which can be as wide as half of the shark 's total length . The function of this structure is unclear but may relate to the shark 's senses . The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision , while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water . The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line , with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception respectively . Inhabiting the shallow coastal waters of the western Indo-Pacific , the winghead shark feeds on small bony fishes , crustaceans , and cephalopods . It gives birth to live young , with the developing embryos receiving nourishment through a placental connection . Females produce annual litters of 6 \u2013 25 pups ; depending on region , birthing may occur from February to June after a gestation period of 8 \u2013 11 months . This harmless species is widely fished for meat , fins , liver oil , and fishmeal . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed it as Endangered in 2016 , as it is thought to have declined in some parts of its range due to over-exploitation . = = Taxonomy = = In 1785 , German naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch described a shark that he referred to Squalus zygaena ( a synonym of Sphyrna zygaena , the smooth hammerhead ) . French zoologist Georges Cuvier , as a brief footnote to the account of S. zygaena in his 1817 Le R\u00e8gne animal distribu\u00e9 d 'apr\u00e8s son organisation , pour servir de base \u00e0 l 'histoire naturelle des animaux et d 'introduction \u00e0 l 'anatomie compar\u00e9e , observed that Bloch 's specimen ( which he labeled \" z. nob . Blochii \" ) was not a smooth hammerhead but rather a different species . Although Cuvier did not propose a proper binomial name , his colleague Achille Valenciennes interpreted it as such in 1822 when he described another specimen of the same species in detail , calling it Zygaena Blochii nobis and attributing the name to Cuvier . In 1862 , Theodore Gill placed the winghead shark in its own genus Eusphyra , derived from the Greek eu ( \" good \" ) and sphyra ( \" hammer \" ) . However , subsequent authors did not accept Eusphyra and preferred to keep this species with the other hammerheads in the genus Sphyrna . Eusphyra was resurrected by Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder in 1948 , and came into wider usage after additional taxonomic research was published by Leonard Compagno in 1979 and 1988 . Nevertheless , some sources still refer to this species as Sphyrna blochii . Other common names for the winghead shark include arrowhead , arrow headed hammerhead shark , and slender hammerhead . = = Phylogeny = = The traditional view of hammerhead shark evolution is that species with smaller cephalofoils evolved first from a requiem shark ancestor , and later gave rise to species with larger cephalofoils . Under this interpretation , the winghead shark is the most derived hammerhead as it has the most extreme cephalofoil morphology . However , molecular phylogenetic research based on isozymes , mitochondrial DNA , and nuclear DNA have found the opposite pattern , with the winghead shark as the most basal member of the hammerhead family . This result supports the counterintuitive idea that the first hammerhead shark to evolve had a large cephalofoil . It also supports the separation of Eusphyra from Sphyrna by keeping the latter monophyletic ( including all descendants of a single ancestor ) . The winghead shark lineage is estimated to have diverged from the rest of the hammerheads some 15 \u2013 20 million years ago during the Miocene . = = Description = = True to its name , the winghead shark 's cephalofoil consists of a pair of long , narrow , and gently swept-back blades . The width of the cephalofoil is equal to 40 \u2013 50 % of the shark 's total length . The front of the cephalofoil has a slight indentation in the middle and a gentle bump on each side in front of the nostrils . Each nostril is roughly twice as long as the width of the mouth and extends along almost the entire leading margin of each blade . The circular eyes , located at the forward outer corners of the cephalofoil , are equipped with protective nictitating membranes . The relatively small , arched mouth contains 15 \u2013 16 upper and 14 lower tooth rows on each side , and sometimes also a single row of tiny teeth at the upper and / or lower symphyses ( jaw midpoints ) . The teeth are small and smooth-edged , with angled triangular cusps . There are five pairs of gill slits , with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin origins . The body is slim and streamlined , with a very tall , narrow , and falcate ( sickle-shaped ) first dorsal fin that originates over the bases of the rather small pectoral fins . The second dorsal fin is much smaller and originates over the aft third of the anal fin base . The anal fin is about half again as long as the second dorsal fin . There is a lengthwise groove on the caudal peduncle at the dorsal origin of the caudal fin . The upper caudal fin lobe is longer than the lower lobe , and bears a notch in the trailing margin near the tip . The skin is covered by overlapping dermal denticles , each with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . This species is brownish gray to gray above and off-white below , and lacks fin markings . It grows up to 1.9 m ( 6.2 ft ) long . = = Distribution and habitat = = The winghead shark is found in the tropical western Indo-Pacific , from the Persian Gulf eastward across South and Southeast Asia to New Guinea and northern Queensland . Its range extends as far north as Taiwan and as far south as the Montebello Islands off Western Australia . This species inhabits shallow waters close to shore and has been known to enter estuaries . = = Biology and ecology = = Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extreme size of the winghead shark 's cephalofoil . The placement of the eyes at the ends of the cephalofoil provides a binocular field of view of 48 \u00b0 , the most of any hammerhead and four times that of a requiem shark ; this species thus has excellent depth perception , which may aid in hunting . This species also has proportionately the longest nostrils among the hammerheads ; longer nostrils contain more chemosensory receptors and can sample more water at a time , increasing the chances of detecting an odor molecule . A winghead shark 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) long is theoretically capable of sampling over 2,300 cm3 ( 140 in3 ) of water per second . Another potential olfactory benefit of the cephalofoil is increased separation between the midpoints of the left and right nostrils , which enhances the shark 's ability to resolve the direction of a scent trail . Finally , the cephalofoil may increase the shark 's ability to detect the electric fields and movements of its prey , by providing a larger surface area for its electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini and mechanoreceptive lateral line . The lateral blades seem too large to function in maneuvering , which has been suggested for other hammerheads . The winghead shark usually hunts close to the sea floor . Its diet consists mainly of small bony fishes , followed by crustaceans and cephalopods . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus blochii , Heteronybelinia heteromorphi , Otobothrium carcharidis , O. mugilis , Phoreiobothrium puriensis , and Phyllobothrium blochii , the nematodes Hysterothylacium ganeshi , Pseudanisakis sp . , Raphidascaroides blochii , and Terranova sp . , the copepod Caligus furcisetifer , and the protozoan Eimeria zygaenae . = = = Life history = = = The winghead shark is viviparous like the rest of its family , with the developing young sustained to term by a placental connection to the mother . Adult females have a single functional ovary , on the right , and two functional uteruses . Compartments form inside the uteruses during pregnancy , one for each embryo . In the waters around Mumbai , the mating season is in July and August during the monsoon . The males bite at the sides of the females as a prelude to copulation . Females can reproduce every year ; the litter size ranges from 6 to 25 pups , and increases with the size of the female . The gestation period lasts 8 \u2013 9 months off western India , and 10 \u2013 11 months off northern Australia . Pregnant females have been reported to quarrel with each other . Initially , the embryo is nourished by yolk and develops in a similar fashion to other sharks . At a length of 4.0 \u2013 4.5 cm ( 1.6 \u2013 1.8 in ) , the cephalofoil and the fins begin to form . When the embryo is 12 \u2013 16 cm ( 4.7 \u2013 6.3 in ) long , the yolk supply begins to run low and folds appear on the yolk sac and uterine wall , which will later interlock to form the placenta . At this stage , the embryo has most of the features of an adult , albeit rudimentary and colorless . The blades of the cephalofoil are folded back along the body , and there are long external gill filaments protruding from the gill slits . At a length of 20 \u2013 29 cm ( 7.9 \u2013 11.4 in ) , the placenta has formed ; the first teeth , dermal denticles , and skin pigmentation appear on the embryo , and the external gills are much reduced in size . By the time the embryo is 30 cm ( 12 in ) long , it resembles a miniature version of the adult . Birthing takes place in May and June off Mumbai and Parangipettai , in March and April in the Gulf of Mannar , and in February and March off northern Australia . The pups emerge tail-first , and their cephalofoils remain folded until after birth to facilitate passage through the cloaca . The newborns measure 32 \u2013 47 cm ( 13 \u2013 19 in ) in length . Sexual maturity is reached at around 1.0 \u2013 1.1 m ( 3.3 \u2013 3.6 ft ) long for males and 1.1 \u2013 1.2 m ( 3.6 \u2013 3.9 ft ) long for females . The maximum lifespan is at least 21 years . = = Human interactions = = Harmless to humans , the winghead shark is caught throughout its range using gillnets , seines , stake nets , longlines , and hook-and-line . The meat is sold fresh , the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup , the liver is a source of vitamin oil , and the offal is processed into fishmeal . This species is taken in large numbers in some areas , such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia , and there is anecdotal evidence that its population has suffered as a result . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the winghead shark as Endangered . This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters , where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN .",

                    "text": "Tiger shark = The tiger shark ( Galeocerdo cuvier ) is a species of requiem shark and the only extant member of the genus Galeocerdo . Commonly known as the \" Sea Tiger \" , the tiger shark is a relatively large macropredator , capable of attaining a length over 5 m ( 16 ft 5 in ) . It is found in many tropical and temperate waters , and it is especially common around central Pacific islands . Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body which resemble a tiger 's pattern , which fade as the shark matures . The tiger shark is a solitary , mostly nocturnal hunter and is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks , consuming a variety of prey ranging from crustaceans , fish , seals , birds , squid , turtles and sea snakes to dolphins and even other smaller sharks . The tiger shark has been known to eat inedible manmade objects that linger in its stomach , and it has a reputation as a \" garbage eater \" . While the tiger shark sits atop the food chain as an apex predator , killer whales have been known on occasion to prey on them . The tiger shark is considered a near threatened species due to finning and fishing by humans . = = Taxonomy = = The shark was first described by Peron and Lesueur in 1822 , and was given the name Squalus cuvier . M\u00fcller and Henle in 1837 renamed it Galeocerdo tigrinus . The genus , Galeocerdo , is derived from the Greek galeos , which means shark , and the Latin cerdus , the word for the hard hairs of pigs . It is often colloquially called the man-eater shark . The tiger shark is a member of the order Carcharhiniformes , the most species-rich order of sharks , with more than 270 species also including the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks . Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes , two dorsal fins , an anal fin , and five gill slits . It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family , commonly referred to as requiem sharks . This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks , such as the blue shark ( Prionace glauca ) , lemon shark ( Negaprion brevirostris ) , and bull shark ( Carcharhinus leucas ) . = = Description = = The tiger shark commonly attains a length of 3.25 \u2013 4.25 m ( 10 ft 8 in \u2013 13 ft 11 in ) and weighs around 385 \u2013 635 kg ( 849 \u2013 1,400 lb ) . Sometimes , an exceptionally large male tiger shark can grow up to 4 m ( 13 ft 1 in ) . Females are larger , and exceptionally big ones can reportedly measure over 5 m ( 16 ft 5 in ) . One female specimen caught off Australia reportedly measured 5.5 m ( 18 ft 1 in ) long and weighed an exceptional 1,524 kg ( 3,360 lb ) , although her weight is thought to have been bolstered by her pregnant state at the time . Even larger specimens have been reported , but are unconfirmed . Among the largest extant sharks , the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) , the basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximus ) and the great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) . Some other species such as megamouth sharks ( Megachasma pelagios ) , Pacific sleeper sharks ( Somniosus pacificus ) , Greenland sharks ( Somniosus microcephalus ) and bluntnose sixgill sharks ( Hexanchus griseus ) broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark , but as these species are comparatively poorly studied , it is unclear whether their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark . The great hammerhead ( Sphyrna mokarran ) , a member of the same taxonomic order as the tiger shark , has a similar or even greater average body length but is lighter and less bulky , with a maximum known weight of 580 kg ( 1,280 lb ) . Its teeth are specialized to slice through flesh , bone , and other tough substances such as turtle shells . Like most sharks , its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth . = = = Skin = = = The skin of a tiger shark can typically range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly . The advantage of this is that when it is hunting for its prey , when prey looks at the shark from above , the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker . And when prey is below the shark and looks up , of course because of the sun , it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark . This is known as countershading . Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures . Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped , which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side . They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini , which enable them to detect electric fields , including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey , which helps them to hunt . Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides . The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water . These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey . = = = Vision = = = A reflective layer behind the tiger shark 's retina , called the tapetum lucidum , allows light-sensing cells a second chance to capture photons of visible light , enhancing vision in low light conditions . A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water , while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed . Tiger sharks normally swim using small body movements . Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot , allowing it to spin quickly on its axis , though the shark 's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail . = = Distribution and habitat = = The tiger shark is often found close to the coast , mainly in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the world . Its behavior is primarily nomadic , but is guided by warmer currents , and it stays closer to the equator throughout the colder months . It tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs , but it does move into channels to pursue prey in shallower waters . In the western Pacific Ocean , the shark has been found as far north as Japan and as far south as New Zealand . A tiger shark tagged in the Caribbean has been tracked migrating to Cape Cod ; although they are a tropical species , the warm Gulf Stream brings the coast of Cape Cod to within the extreme north of its range during the summer . Tiger sharks can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico , North American beaches , and parts of South America . It is also commonly known in the Caribbean Sea . Other locations where tiger sharks are seen include off Africa , China , Hong Kong , India , Australia , and Indonesia . Certain tiger sharks have been recorded at depths just shy of 900 m ( 3,000 ft ) , but some sources claim they move into shallow water normally thought to be too shallow for a species of its size . A recent study showed the average tiger shark would be recorded at 350 m ( 1,100 ft ) , making it uncommon to see tiger sharks in shallow water . However , tiger sharks in Hawaii have been observed in depths as shallow as 3 m ( 10 ft ) and regularly observed in coastal waters at depths of 6 to 12 m ( 20 to 40 ft ) . = = Feeding = = The tiger shark is an apex predator and has a reputation for eating anything . Young tiger sharks are found to prey largely on small fish , as well as various small jellyfish , cephalopods , and other mollusks . Around the time they attain 2.3 m ( 7.5 ft ) , or near sexual maturity , their prey selection expands considerably , and much larger animals become regular prey . Numerous fish , crustaceans , sea birds , sea snakes , marine mammals ( e.g. bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops ) , common dolphins ( Delphinus ) , spotted dolphins ( Stenella ) , dugongs ( Dugong dugon ) , seals and sea lions ) , and sea turtles ( including the three largest species : the leatherback ( Dermochelys coriacea ) , the loggerhead ( Caretta caretta ) and the green sea turtles ( Chelonia mydas ) , ) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks . The tiger shark also eats other sharks ( including adult sandbar sharks ( Carcharhinus plumbeus ) ) , as well as rays , and will sometimes even eat other tiger sharks . Due to high risk of predatory attacks , dolphins often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks . Tiger sharks may also attack injured or ailing whales and prey upon them . A group was documented attacking and killing an ailing humpback whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) in 2006 near Hawaii . The tiger shark also scavenges on dead whales . In one such documented incident , they were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside great white sharks . Evidence of dugong predation was identified in one study that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast . Additionally , examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks . Finally , dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant . The broad , heavily calcified jaws and nearly terminal mouth , combined with robust , serrated teeth , enable the tiger shark to take on these large prey . In addition , excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source . The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence , even in murky water . The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout . When attacking , the shark often eats its prey whole , although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time . Notably , terrestrial mammals , including horses ( Equus ferus caballus ) , goats ( Capra aegagrus hircus ) , sheep ( Ovis aries ) , dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ) , cats ( Felis catus ) , brown rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) , are fairly common in the stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii . In one case , remains of two flying-foxes were found in stomach of this shark . Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style , it often mistakenly eats inedible objects , such as automobile license plates , oil cans , tires , and baseballs . = = = Swimming efficiency and stealth = = = All tiger sharks generally swim slowly , which , combined with cryptic coloration , may make them difficult for prey to detect them in some habitats . They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds . Despite their sluggish appearance , tiger sharks are one of the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks . Once the shark has come close , a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape . = = Reproduction = = Males reach sexual maturity at 2.3 to 2.9 m ( 7.5 to 9.5 ft ) and females at 2.5 to 3.5 m ( 8.2 to 11.5 ft ) . Females mate once every three years . They breed by internal fertilization . The male inserts one of his claspers into the female 's genital opening ( cloaca ) , acting as a guide for the sperm . The male uses his teeth to hold the female still during the procedure , often causing the female considerable discomfort . Mating in the Northern Hemisphere generally takes place between March and May , with birth between April and June the following year . In the Southern Hemisphere , mating takes place in November , December , or early January . The tiger shark is the only species in its family that is ovoviviparous ; its eggs hatch internally and the young are born live when fully developed . The young develop inside the mother 's body for up to 16 months . Litters range from 10 to 80 pups . A newborn is generally 51 to 76 cm ( 20 to 30 in ) long . This shark typically reaches maturity at lengths of 2 to 3 m ( 6.6 to 9.8 ft ) . It is unknown how long tiger sharks live , but they can live longer than 12 years . = = Conservation = = The tiger shark is captured and killed for its fins , flesh , and liver . It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries . Several populations have declined where they have been heavily fished . Continued demand for fins may result in further declines in the future . Tiger sharks are considered a near threatened species due to excessive finning and fishing by humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature . While shark fin has very few nutrients , shark liver has a high concentration of vitamin A which is used in the production of vitamin oils . In addition , the tiger shark is captured and killed for its distinct skin , as well as by big-game fishers . In 2010 , Greenpeace International added the tiger shark to its seafood red list , which is a list of fish commonly sold around the world , and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries . = = Relationship with humans = = Although it is very rare for sharks to bite humans , the tiger shark is reported to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark attacks , and is sometimes regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species . They often visit shallow reefs , harbors , and canals , creating the potential for encounter with humans . The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water . While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans , its bite rate is low . The tiger is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans , with the great white shark being first . On average , three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii , but they are rarely fatal . This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim , surf , and dive in Hawaiian waters every day . Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November , when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth . Between 1959 and 2000 , 4,668 tiger sharks were culled in an effort to protect the tourism industry . These efforts , despite damaging the shark population , were shown to be ineffective in decreasing the number of interactions between humans and tiger sharks . It is illegal to feed sharks in Hawaii ( except for traditional Hawaiian cultural or religious practices ) , and interaction with them , such as cage diving , is discouraged . South African shark behaviorist and shark diver Mark Addison demonstrated divers could interact and dive with them outside of a shark cage in a 2007 Discovery Channel special , and underwater photographer Fiona Ayerst swam with them in the Bahamas . = = Mythology = = The tiger shark is considered to be sacred na \u02bbaumakua ( ancestor spirits ) by some native Hawaiians who think their eyeballs have special powers of visual perception . This aligns with the general known facts about sharks and their highly developed senses .",

This abundant , bottom-dwelling species can be found from the intertidal zone to a depth of around 100 m ( 330 ft ) , particularly over rocky reefs and kelp beds . With a series of thick , parallel , dark stripes running along its stout body , the pyjama shark has an unmistakable appearance . It is additionally characterized by a short head and snout with a pair of slender barbels that do not reach the mouth , and two dorsal fins that are placed far back on the body . It can grow up to a length of 1.1 m ( 3.6 ft ) long . The pyjama shark is primarily nocturnal , spending most of the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation . It often forms groups , particularly during summer . This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds on a wide variety of fishes and invertebrates ; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka squid ( Loligo reynaudi ) . When threatened , it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head . Reproduction is oviparous , with females laying rectangular , dark brown egg cases two at a time year-round . This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums . It is often caught as a bycatch of commercial and recreational fisheries . Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests . Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range . = = Taxonomy = = The pyjama shark was originally described as Squalus africanus by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 , in the thirteenth edition of Systema Naturae . He did not designate a type specimen . In 1837 , Scottish physician and zoologist Andrew Smith created the new genus Poroderma for this species and the related leopard catshark ( P. pantherinum , at the time believed to be multiple species ) . In 1908 , the pyjama shark was made the type species of the genus by American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler . = = Distribution and habitat = = A bottom-dwelling inhabitant of temperate inshore waters , the pyjama shark is found off South Africa , from Table Bay off Cape Town to north of East London . It is most abundant off the Western Cape , and may venture as far as Saldanha Bay in the west and KwaZulu-Natal in the east ; old records from Mauritius , Madagascar , and Zaire are almost certainly erroneous . The pyjama shark is commonly encountered in very shallow intertidal and littoral waters no more than 5 m ( 16 ft ) deep , though in and around Algoa Bay it occurs at depths of 50 \u2013 100 m ( 160 \u2013 330 ft ) and has been reported to 108 m ( 354 ft ) . It favors rocky reefs and beds of Ecklonia kelp . = = Description = = The pyjama shark is the larger and thicker-bodied of the two Poroderma species , growing to 1.1 m ( 3.6 ft ) long and 7.9 kg ( 17 lb ) or more in weight . Both sexes grow to roughly the same maximum size . The head and snout are short and slightly flattened , with a narrowly parabolic outline when viewed from above or below . Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a flap of skin in front ; the flap has a three-lobed shape with the central lobe forming a long , conical barbel . The barbels are thicker than in the leopard catshark , and do not reach the mouth . The eyes are horizontally oval and placed rather high on the head , with rudimentary nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) and a thick ridge running underneath . The sizable mouth forms a broad arch , with short furrows extending from the corners onto both the upper and lower jaws ; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed . There are 18 \u2013 25 and 14 \u2013 24 tooth rows on either side of the upper and lower jaws , respectively . The teeth have a slender central cusp flanked by a pair of small cusplets ; those of adult males are slightly thicker than those of females . The body is fairly compressed from side to side and tapers towards the tail . The two dorsal fins are placed far back : the first originates over the rear of the pelvic fins while the second originates over the midpoint of the anal fin . The first dorsal is much larger than the second . The pectoral fins are large and broad . The pelvic fins are lower than the pectorals but their bases are about equal in length . Adult males have a pair of short , thick claspers , with the inner margins of the pelvic fins partially fused over them to form an \" apron \" . The short and broad caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The skin is very thick and bears well-calcified dermal denticles ; each denticle has an arrowhead-shaped crown with three posterior points , mounted on a short stalk . The dorsal coloration is distinctive , consisting of 5 \u2013 7 thick , parallel , dark stripes running from the snout to the caudal peduncle on a variably grayish or brownish background ; the stripes become broken near the tail and the belly . In some sharks , the main stripe on either side may fork behind the eye , the stripes may be split in two by lighter central lines , or one or more large dark spots may be present . The underside is pale , sometimes with light gray spotting , and clearly demarcated from the flank color . Young sharks resemble the adults , but may be much lighter or have much darker stripes . An albino specimen has been recorded from False Bay . = = Biology and ecology = = Rather slow-swimming , the pyjama shark spends most of the day resting in caves or crevices or amongst kelp , emerging at night to actively forage for food . Many individuals may congregate at a single spot , particularly in summer . This species falls prey to larger sharks , and is one of the cartilaginous fish most frequently consumed by the broadnose sevengill shark ( Notorynchus cepedianus ) . When threatened , it often curls into a circle with its tail covering its head , in a similar fashion to the shysharks ( Haploblepharus ) . Its eggs are fed upon by the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria , which can pierce the outer covering to extract the yolk within . Like other sharks , the pyjama shark maintains osmotic balance with the environment by regulating its internal concentration of urea and other nitrogenous wastes . Experiments have shown that the shark 's capacity for osmoregulation is dependent on how well it has fed . The pyjama shark feeds on a wide variety of small animals , including bony fishes such as anchovies , gurnards , and hakes , hagfishes , smaller sharks and rays and their egg cases , crustaceans , cephalopods , bivalves , and polychaete worms ; it has also been known to scavenge on fish offal . Although it has a predilection for cephalopods , the dietary composition of this opportunistic predator generally reflects the locally available prey types . For example , in False Bay the Cape rock lobster ( Jasus lalandii ) is the most important food source , followed by cephalopods and then fish . Pyjama sharks have been observed seizing and tearing off tentacles from octopus and cuttlefish with a twisting motion ; on one occasion three sharks were seen attacking an octopus simultaneously in this manner . During mass spawnings of the chokka squid ( Loligo vulgaris reynaudi ) , which occur unpredictably year-round but peak from October to December , pyjama sharks deviate from their nocturnal habits and gather in substantial numbers inside the squids ' \" egg beds \" during daytime . The sharks conceal their heads amongst the egg masses , while their stripes break up the outlines of their bodies . As the female squid descend to the sea floor to attach their eggs , guarded by the males , they become vulnerable to the sharks ' ambush attacks . An oviparous species , both male and female pyjama sharks seem to be reproductively active throughout the year . Adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts , with a single egg maturing in each at a time . The egg is contained in a tough , rectangular , dark brown capsule 9.5 cm ( 3.7 in ) long and 4.5 cm ( 1.8 in ) across , with long tendrils at the corners that enable the female to fasten the capsule to underwater structures such as algae stipes or gorgonians . Eggs maintained in aquariums hatch in approximately five and a half months , with the hatching shark measuring 14 \u2013 15 cm ( 5.5 \u2013 5.9 in ) long . Males and females begin to mature sexually at 78 \u2013 81 cm ( 31 \u2013 32 in ) and 79 \u2013 83 cm ( 31 \u2013 33 in ) long respectively , and all sharks are adult by a length of 89 cm ( 35 in ) . = = Human interactions = = Among the most common South African catsharks , the pyjama shark is harmless to humans and difficult to approach underwater . Because of its small size , attractive appearance , and hardiness , it is popularly exhibited by public aquariums . The aquarium trade supports a small fishery targeting this species and the similar leopard catshark . Large numbers of pyjama sharks are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries using longlines , gillnets , beach-seines , and bottom trawls ; they are also readily hooked by recreational anglers , especially during the summer when they aggregate . Although edible , most are discarded while some are used for lobster bait . The toll taken by fishery bycatch is likely greatly underestimated , as many fishers who use line gear regard pajama sharks as pests that \" steal \" bait , and kill them before discarding them . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened , citing its small distribution and a recent increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region . However , there is no evidence to suggest that its population has declined . There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species , though its range encompasses two marine reserves . The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark , which would limit the degree to which it can be targeted by commercial fisheries .",

                    "text": "Crested shelduck = The crested shelduck or Korean crested shelduck ( Tadorna cristata ) is a species of bird in the family Anatidae . It is critically endangered and may be extinct . The male crested shelduck has a greenish-black crown , breast , primaries , and tail , while the rest of its face , chin , and throat are brownish black . The male 's belly , undertail coverts , and flanks are a dark grey with black striations . The upper wing coverts are white , while its speculum is an iridescent green . The female has a white eye ring , black crest , white face , chin , throat , neck , and uppers wing coverts and a dark brown body with white striations . Additionally , both sexes have a distinctive green tuft of feathers protruding from the head . Very little is known about this bird because of the limited number of observations of this species . It apparently breeds in Korea and eastern Russia and is probably a relict species that had a wider distribution in prehistoric times . Some think that this species is extinct , although occasional sightings are reported , including a number of recent reports from the interior wetlands of China . Due to the persistent reports of the species ' survival , it is listed as critically endangered . However , the crested shelduck has not been definitively sighted since 1964 . = = Taxonomy = = The crested shelduck was initially collected in April 1877 near Vladivostock , Russia . However , it was not described until 1890 when the English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater decided that the specimen was a possible hybrid between the ruddy shelduck ( Tadorna ferruginea ) and falcated duck ( Anas falcata ) . Around 1913 , a pair was collected in Korea , and the male was presented to Japanese ornithologist Nagamichi Kuroda . Kuroda noted that the plumage of the specimens was not definitively intermediate between Sclater 's suggested parents of the alleged hybrid . Another female was collected and given to Kuroda in 1916 , and supported by three specimens of a bird which was clearly not a hybrid and a historical record of the species in Japan , Kuroda described this bird as Pseudotadorna cristata in 1917 . The 1916 female was designated the holotype and preserved with the male in Kuroda 's collection . A member of the family Anatidae , this species was considered distinct enough to merit its own genus by Kuroda , but is now placed in the genus Tadorna , which includes six other species of Old World shelducks . The genus name Tadorna comes from the Celtic word tadorne and means \" pied waterfowl \" , essentially the same as the English \" shelduck \" . The specific epithet , cristata , comes from the Latin word for crested . The species ' common name is derived from the tuft of green feathers from the shelduck 's head . This species is also known as the Korean crested shelduck , Korean sheldrake , and Korean Mandarin . = = Description = = The crested shelduck is sexually dimorphic , with the male possessing a greenish-black crown , breast , primaries , and tail , while the rest of its face , chin , and throat are brownish black . The male 's belly , undertail coverts , and flanks are a dark grey with black striations . The upper wing coverlets are white , while its speculum is an iridescent green . The female has a large white eye ring , black crest , and white face , chin , throat , neck , and upper wing coverts . It also has a dark brown body with white striations . Both sexes have a green tuft of feathers protruding from their head . The crested shelduck is about 63 to 71 centimetres ( 25 to 28 in ) long , and therefore is slightly larger than a mallard . Its bill and legs are pinkish , though those of the female are paler than those of the male . The bill of the male has a small , knob-like appendage at its base . The plumage of the immature is unknown . = = Distribution and habitat = = The crested shelduck has been collected near Vladivostok in Russia and near Fusan and Kunsan in Korea . It has been proposed that the species breeds in far-eastern Russia , northern North Korea , and northeast China and winters in southern Japan , southwest Korea , and along the east China coast as far south as Shanghai . It is believed to have a relict range , or to have been more widespread in historic times . This species is believed to live in a wide variety of wetland and deep-water habitats at varying elevations . While all collected individuals are from the coast , especially near river mouths , recently there have been a number of reports from interior wetlands in northeastern China . It has been speculated that this species may breed in mountainous areas either away from water or on volcanic lakes . = = Ecology and behavior = = Though not much is known about this shelduck , it is believed to be migratory , traveling from Siberia in the breeding season to Korea , southern Russia , and Japan for the winter . The crested shelduck is believed to eat aquatic vegetation , agricultural crops , algae , invertebrates , mollusks , crustaceans , carrion , and garbage . It has been suggested that this shelduck may be a nocturnal feeder . While its nest has not been described , similar shelducks nest in burrows and cavities ; it has also been suggested that this species may nest in tree cavities . It has been proposed that this species lays less than ten eggs which the female alone incubates . It is believed to breed from May to July . The shelduck has been observed in flocks of two to eight birds . = = Conservation = = The crested shelduck has never been numerous in modern times , though it is thought to have been more widespread historically due to its presence in Japanese aviculture . The species is known from only a handful of sightings and some retroactively declared it extinct in 1916 after a female was shot at Busan , South Korea . In 1943 , a sighting of this bird was reported near Chungcheongbukdo , building hopes that the species persisted . A group of three birds , two females and a male , was sighted by two Russian students in 1964 in the Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago near Vladivostok with a small flock of harlequin ducks . In 1971 it was reported from North Korea 's northeast coast and in 1985 two were reported from eastern Russia . However , there are severe doubts about the accuracy of the 1971 record . A recent survey of Chinese hunters resulted in a number of unconfirmed reports from northeastern China . For example , a Chinese forest worker claimed that he unknowingly ate two in 1984 . There are also unconfirmed reports of about twenty crested shelducks in the Dashanbao region of Yunnan , though many believe this flock to be a misidentified flock of ruddy shelducks . It is believed that , if the species survives , there likely are fewer than 50 individuals . This species is threatened with extinction due to habitat loss , hunting , and overcollecting . In an attempt to gather reports of this species and raise awareness to prevent hunters from consuming this species , 300,000 leaflets were distributed in Russia , Japan , China , South Korea , and North Korea in 1983 , with the only resulting report being the 1971 North Korea record . 15,000 leaflets were distributed in northeastern China in 1985 and 1991 . While this garnered 82 reports of the species , follow-up surveys of the area failed to find the shelduck . The Tumangan Development Project is threatening to destroy potential habitat in the area of several of the historic records . = = Relationship with humans = = This duck was collected in Korea and exported to Japan between 1716 and 1736 for aviculture , where it was known as the Korean Mandarin Duck . It was captured for aviculture in Japan up to at least 1854 and was portrayed in the Kanbun-Kinpu , a Japanese avicultural work . Old Chinese tapestries also portray a duck similar in appearance to the crested shelduck . Kuroda claimed that Japanese hunters were still hunting the species in Korea in the 1920s . Three specimens exist in museums . The only male specimen is kept with a female in the Kuroda collection in the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology , Tokyo . The male was collected at the mouth of the Geum River in 1913 or 1914 , and the female was collected near Busan in December 1916 . The female specimen described by Philip Lutley Sclater , collected by Lieutenant F. Irmininger near Vladivostok in April 1877 , was displayed in 1894 by the Zoological Society of London and today is kept in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen . Two additional crested shelduck specimens are known to have existed , though both have been lost . The female collected in 1913 along with the sole male was given to a friend of the collector and subsequently has vanished . Additionally , around 1900 a Chinese hunter offered a specimen to a Peking University professor , but , as the professor did not realize how rare the bird was , he turned it down . In 1991 , the crested shelduck appeared on a Mongolian postage stamp .",

                    "text": "Northern mockingbird = The northern mockingbird ( Mimus polyglottos ) is the only mockingbird commonly found in North America . This bird is mainly a permanent resident , but northern birds may move south during harsh weather . This species has rarely been observed in Europe . This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Natur\u00e6 in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos . The northern mockingbird is renowned for its mimicking ability , as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name , ' many-tongued mimic . ' The northern mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly . Its tail and wings have white patches which are visible in flight . The northern mockingbird is an omnivore . It eats both insects and fruits . It is often found in open areas and forest edges but forages in grassy land . The northern mockingbird breeds in southeastern Canada , the United States , northern Mexico , the Bahamas , the Cayman Islands and the Greater Antilles . It is replaced further south by its closest living relative , the tropical mockingbird . The Socorro mockingbird , an endangered species , is also closely related , contrary to previous opinion . The northern mockingbird is listed as of Least Concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . The northern mockingbird is known for its intelligence and has also been noted in North American culture . A 2009 study showed that the bird was able to recognize individual humans , particularly noting those who had previously been intruders or threats . Also birds recognize their breeding spots and return to areas in which they had greatest success in previous years . Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior . Finally , the mockingbird has influenced United States culture in multiple ways . The bird is a state bird of five different states , has been used in book titles , and has also been used in popular songs and lullabies among other appearances in U.S. culture . = = Taxonomy = = Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus first described this species in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos . Its current Latin name , Mimus polyglottos , means \u201c many-tongued mimic \u201d , representing its outstanding ability to mimic various sounds . The northern mockingbird is considered to be conspecific with the tropical mockingbird ( Mimus gilvus ) . This species is categorized as the northern mockingbird as the closest living relative to M. gilvus . = = = Subspecies = = = There are three recognized subspecies for the northern mockingbird . There have been proposed races from the Bahamas and Haiti placed under the orpheus section . M. p. polyglottos ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) : generally found in the eastern portion of North America ranging from Nova Scotia to Nebraska , to as far south as Texas and Florida . M. p. leucopterus ' Western Mockingbird ' ( Vigors , 1839 ) : generally found in the western portion of North America ranging from NW Nebraska and Western Texas to the Pacific Coast , and south to Mexico ( the Isthmus of Tehuantepec ) , and Socorro Island . Larger than M. p. polyglottos and has a slightly shorter tail , upperparts are more buff and paler , underparts have a stronger buff pigment . M. p. orpheus ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) from the Bahamas to the Greater Antilles , also the Cayman and Virgin Islands . Similar to M. m. polyglottos except smaller , a paler shade of gray on its back , and underparts with practically little , if any buff at all . = = Description = = The northern mockingbird is a medium-sized mimid that has long legs and tail . Males and females look alike . Its upper parts are colored gray , while its underparts have a white or whitish-gray color . It has parallel wing bars on the half of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight . The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight . The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow , but there have been instances of an orange color . The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base . The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back , distinguished spots and streaks on its chest , and a gray or grayish-green iris . Northern mockingbirds measure from 20.5 to 28 cm ( 8.1 to 11.0 in ) including a tail almost as long as its body . The wingspan can range from 31 \u2013 38 cm ( 12 \u2013 15 in ) and body mass is from 40 \u2013 58 g ( 1.4 \u2013 2.0 oz ) . Males tend to be slightly larger than females . Among standard measurements , the wing chord is 10 to 12 cm ( 3.9 to 4.7 in ) , the tail is 10 to 13.4 cm ( 3.9 to 5.3 in ) , the culmen is 1.6 to 1.9 cm ( 0.63 to 0.75 in ) and the tarsus is 2.9 to 3.4 cm ( 1.1 to 1.3 in ) . The northern mockingbird 's lifespan is observed to be up to 8 years , but captive birds can live up to 20 years . = = Distribution and habitat = = The mockingbird 's breeding range is from Maritime provinces of Canada westwards to British Columbia , practically the entire Continental United States south of the northern Plains states and Pacific northwest , and the majority of Mexico to eastern Oaxaca and Veracruz . The mockingbird is generally a year-round resident of its range , but the birds that live in the northern portion of its range have been noted further south during the winter season . Sightings of the mockingbird have also been recorded in Hawaii ( where it was introduced in the 1920s ) , southeastern Alaska , and twice as transatlantic vagrants in Britain . The mockingbird is thought to be at least partly migratory in the northern portions of its range , but the migratory behavior is not well understood . In the nineteenth century , the range of the mockingbird expanded northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts , although the sightings were sporadic . Within the first five decades of the twentieth century , regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine , Vermont , Ohio , Iowa , and New York . In western states such as California , the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties . Islands that saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda ( in which it failed ) , Barbados , St. Helena , Socorro Island , the Cayman Islands and Tahiti . The mockingbird 's habitat varies by location , but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation . In the eastern regions , suburban and urban areas such as parks , gardens are frequent residential areas . It has an affinity for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting . In western regions , desert scrub , chaparral are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food , it prefers short grass . It also has an affinity for mowed lawns . This bird does not nest in densely forested areas , and generally resides in the same habitats year round . = = Behavior = = = = = Diet = = = The northern mockingbird is an omnivore . The birds ' diet consists of arthropods , earthworms , berries , fruits , seeds , and seldom , lizards . Mockingbirds can drink from puddles , river and lake edges , or dew and rain droplets that amass onto plants . Adult mockingbirds also have been seen drinking sap from the cuts on recently pruned trees . Its diet heavily consists of animal prey during the breeding season , but takes a drastic shift to fruits during the fall and winter . The drive for fruits amid winter has been noted for the geographic expansion of the mockingbird , and in particular , the fruit of Rosa multiflora , a favorite of the birds , is a possible link . Mockingbirds also eat garden fruits such as tomatoes , apples , and berries . These birds forage on the ground or in vegetation ; they also fly down from a perch to capture food . While foraging , they frequently spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches . There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior , with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey . = = = Breeding = = = Both the male and female of the species reach sexual maturity after 1 year of life . The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer . The males arrive before the beginning of the season to establish their territories . The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites . They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females . The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings . They sing and call as they perform all of these displays . The species can remain monogamous for many years , but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird 's lifetime . The northern mockingbird pairs hatch about 2 to 4 broods a year . In one breeding season , the northern mockingbird lays an average of 4 eggs . They hatch after about 11 to 14 days of incubation . After about 10 to 15 days of life , the offspring become independent . Both the male and female are involved in the nest building . The male does most of the work , while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators . The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground . The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs , while the inner part is lined with grasses , dead leaves , moss , or artificial fibers . The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots . The female lays three to five eggs , and she incubates them for nearly two weeks . Once the eggs are hatched , both the male and female will feed the chicks . The birds aggressively defend their nests and surrounding areas against other birds and animals . When a predator is persistent , mockingbirds that are summoned by distinct calls from neighboring territories may join the attack . Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder . In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs they consider a threat , it is not unheard of for mockingbirds to target humans . The birds are absolutely unafraid and will attack much larger birds , even hawks . One famous incident in Tulsa , Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted in the distribution of a warning letter to residents . = = = Sexual selection = = = Northern mockingbirds are famous for their song repertoires . Studies have shown that males sing songs at the beginning of breeding season to attract females . Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males . In addition , unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males . The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season . Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status , a male mockingbird will vary his song production . The unmated male keeps close track of this change . He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male . Unmated males are also more likely to use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range . Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous , mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates . An observational study by Logan demonstrates that the female is continuously evaluating the quality of the male and his territory . The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory at the beginning of a new breeding season . In those cases , the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male \u2019 s territory , evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males . The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female , while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs . At the same time , both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well . Divorce , mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds . = = = Sex allocation = = = Northern mockingbirds adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to the food availability and population density . Male offspring usually require more parental investment . There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex at the beginning of a breeding season when the food is abundant . Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation . In passerine birds , like the northern mockingbird , females are more likely to disperse than males . Hence , it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense . Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments , it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio . = = = Mating = = = Northern mockingbirds are socially monogamous . The two sexes look alike except that males are a little larger in size than females . Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds . Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders , and so exhibit greater parental investment . However , males are more defensive of their nests than females . In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults , females have more freedom in choosing their mates . In these cases , these female breeders have the option of changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care , which includes feeding and nest defense . High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory , and so these males are preferred by females . = = = Parental care = = = Northern mockingbirds are altricial , meaning that , when hatched , they are born relatively immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents . The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation . The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch but there is no increase during the egg stage . A recent study shows that both food availability and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds . Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to care for the nest and perform self-maintenance . Increasing temperature , however , reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs . The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors . Mockingbird nests are also often parasitized by cowbirds . The parents are found to reject parasitic eggs at an intermediate rate . A recent study has shown that foreign eggs are more likely to be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season . Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet , so are less likely to reject foreign eggs . There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites . If the breeding season of the parasites starts later , there is less likelihood of parasitism . Hence , it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs . = = = Song and calls = = = Although many species of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds , the northern mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so . Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren , northern cardinal , tufted titmouse , eastern towhee , house sparrow , wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs , calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher , jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay , and alarm , chups , and chirrs of the American robin . It imitates not only birds , but also other animals such as cats , dogs , frogs , crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms . As convincing as these imitations may be to humans , they often fail to fool other birds , such as the Florida scrub-jay . The northern mockingbird 's mimicry is likely to serve as a form of sexual selection through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird 's song repertoire size . A 2013 study attempted to determine model selection in vocal mimics , and the data suggested that mimicry in the mockingbird resulted from the bird being genetically predisposed to learning vocalizations with acoustic characteristics such as an enlarged auditory template . Both male and female mockingbirds sing , with the latter being generally quieter and less vocal . Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continue into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall . Frequency in female singing is more sporadic , as it sings less often in the summer and fall , and only sings when the male is away from the territory . The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region . Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas , and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200 , approximately . It continually expands its repertoire during its life , though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher . There are four recognized calls for the mockingbird : the nest relief call , hew call , chat or chatburst , and the begging call . The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators , conspecific chasing , and various interactions between mates . The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use , as chats are year-round , and chatbursts occur in the fall . Another difference is that chatbursts appear to be used in territorial defense in the fall , and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed . The nest relief and begging calls are only used by the males . = = = Ontogeny = = = A laboratory observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings ( thirty-five and three , respectively ) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds . Notable milestones included the eyes opening , soft vocalizations , begging , and preening began within the first six days of life . Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching , fear crouching , and stretching appeared by the ninth day . Wing-flashing , bathing , flight , and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days ( nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days ) . Improvements of flight , walking , self-feeding and walking took place within forty days . Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages , to the extent of one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other . = = Predation and threats = = Adult mockingbirds can fall victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl , screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk , though their tenacious behavior leads them to being less likely to being captured . Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds . Snakes rarely capture incubating females . Fledgelings have been prey to cats , red-tailed hawks , and crows . Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays , fish crows and American crows , red-tailed hawks , swallow-tailed kites , snakes , squirrels , and cats . Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus have been found in Florida and Arizona populations , respectively . Winter storms limit the expansion of mockingbirds in its range . The storms have played a role in the declining of the Ohio populations ( where it has since recovered ) , Michigan , Minnesota and likely in Quebec . Dry seasons also affects the mockingbird populations in Arizona . = = Intelligence = = In a paper published in 2009 , researchers found that mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who , earlier in the study , had approached and threatened the mockingbirds ' nest . Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it , while others avoided the nest . Later , the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior , while ignoring the other individuals . = = = Adaptation to urban habitats = = = The northern mockingbird is a species that is found in both urban and rural habitats . There are now more northern mockingbirds living in urban habitats than non-urban environments , so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species . Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities , and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds . A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats . Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats . Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low . One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones , as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps . Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas . The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats have led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in its population in the Baltimore and Washington , D.C. population . = = In culture = = It also features in the title and central metaphor of the novel To Kill a Mockingbird , by Harper Lee . In that novel , mockingbirds are portrayed as innocent and generous , and two of the major characters , Atticus Finch and Miss Maudie , say it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because \" they don 't do one thing for us but make music for us to enjoy . They don 't eat up people 's gardens , don 't nest in corncribs , they don 't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us \" . \" Hush , Little Baby \" is a traditional lullaby , thought to have been written in the Southern United States , its key first lines , \" Hush , little baby , don 't say a word , Mama 's gonna buy you a mockingbird . And if that mockingbird don 't sing , Mama 's gonna buy you a diamond ring . \" The song of the northern mockingbird inspires much of classic American folk song of the mid-19th century , \" Listen to the Mocking Bird \" . Mockin ' Bird Hill is a popular song best known through recordings by Patti Page , Donna Fargo , and by Les Paul and Mary Ford in 1951 . Thomas Jefferson , the third President of the United States , had a pet mockingbird named \" Dick . \" = = State bird = = The northern mockingbird is the state bird of Arkansas , Florida , Mississippi , Tennessee and Texas , and formerly the state bird of South Carolina .",

First described in 2007 , it is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus , which are found on other Malagasy rodents . The length of the idiosoma , the main body , is 630 to 670 \u03bcm in females and 450 to 480 \u03bcm in males . Unlike A. eliurus , this species lacks distinct sternal glands ( secretory organs ) between two lyrifissures ( sensory organs ) on the lower part of the female body . The pilus dentilis , a sensory organ on the chelicera , is serrate , which distinguishes it from A. gymnuromys . Females of A. gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield ( covering part of the underparts ) and shorter setae ( bristles ) on the upperparts . = = Taxonomy and ecology = = Andreacarus voalavo was named in 2007 by Ashley Dowling , Andre Bochkov , and Barry OConnor on the basis of 15 specimens found on an individual of the rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus that was collected in 1994 in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve in northern Madagascar . The specific name , voalavo , is taken from the generic name of the type host . Voalavo gymnocaudus , the only known host , is only found in the Anjanaharibe-Sud and Marojejy massifs of the Malagasy Northern Highlands . A. voalavo is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus , found on other Malagasy rodents . They are members of the genus Andreacarus , which currently includes 11 species found on rodents and other small mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa . = = Description = = In the female , the pilus dentilis , a sensory organ on the chelicera ( mouthpart ) , is serrate , not smooth as in A. gymnuromys . The idiosoma ( main part of the body ) is 630 to 670 \u03bcm long and 370 to 435 \u03bcm wide and the dorsal shield ( covering the upper side ) is 620 to 655 \u03bcm long and 360 to 370 \u03bcm wide . The dorsal setae ( bristles ) are long relative to A. gymnuromys . The sternal shield ( on the lower side of the body ) is 115 to 125 \u03bcm long and 184 to 200 \u03bcm wide and is more ornamented than in A. gymnuromys . Unlike A. eliurus , A. voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands ( secretory organs ) between the lyrifissures ( sensory organs ) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body . The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield ( 232 to 253 by 170 to 182 \u03bcm ) , the peritrematic shield ( 140 to 147 by 117 to 127 \u03bcm ) , and the anal shield ( 140 to 147 by 117 to 127 \u03bcm ) . On the soft part of the cuticle , there are nine pairs of setae . The first segments of the legs , the coxae , lack hooks .

                    "text": "Fish = A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits . Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish , as well as various extinct related groups . Most fish are ectothermic ( \" cold-blooded \" ) , allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change , though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature . Fish are abundant in most bodies of water . They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments , from high mountain streams ( e.g. , char and gudgeon ) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans ( e.g. , gulpers and anglerfish ) . With 33,100 described species , fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates . Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide , especially as food . Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries ( see fishing ) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean ( see aquaculture ) . They are also caught by recreational fishers , kept as pets , raised by fishkeepers , and exhibited in public aquaria . Fish have had a role in culture through the ages , serving as deities , religious symbols , and as the subjects of art , books and movies . Because the term \" fish \" is defined negatively , and excludes the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals ) which descend from within the same ancestry , it is paraphyletic , and is not considered a proper grouping in systematic biology . The traditional term pisces ( also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification . The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period . Although they lacked a true spine , they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts . Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era , diversifying into a wide variety of forms . Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators . The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period , after which many ( such as sharks ) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods . = = Evolution = = Fish do not represent a monophyletic group , and therefore the \" evolution of fish \" is not studied as a single event . Early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small , jawless , armored fish known as ostracoderms . Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct . An extant clade , the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish . The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils . The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth . It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force , improved respiration , or a combination of factors . Fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like Sea squirt , whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways . The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood ( as some sea squirts do today ) , although perhaps the reverse is the case . = = = Taxonomy = = = Fish are a paraphyletic group : that is , any clade containing all fish also contains the tetrapods , which are not fish . For this reason , groups such as the \" Class Pisces \" seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications . Traditional classification divide fish into three extant classes , and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree , sometimes as their own classes : Class Agnatha ( jawless fish ) Subclass Cyclostomata ( hagfish and lampreys ) Subclass Ostracodermi ( armoured jawless fish ) \u2020 Class Chondrichthyes ( cartilaginous fish ) Subclass Elasmobranchii ( sharks and rays ) Subclass Holocephali ( chimaeras and extinct relatives ) Class Placodermi ( armoured fish ) \u2020 Class Acanthodii ( \" spiny sharks \" , sometimes classified under bony fishes ) \u2020 Class Osteichthyes ( bony fish ) Subclass Actinopterygii ( ray finned fishes ) Subclass Sarcopterygii ( fleshy finned fishes , ancestors of tetrapods ) The above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non-specialist and general works . Many of the above groups are paraphyletic , in that they have given rise to successive groups : Agnathans are ancestral to Chondrichthyes , who again have given rise to Acanthodiians , the ancestors of Osteichthyes . With the arrival of phylogenetic nomenclature , the fishes has been split up into a more detailed scheme , with the following major groups : Class Myxini ( hagfish ) Class Pteraspidomorphi \u2020 ( early jawless fish ) Class Thelodonti \u2020 Class Anaspida \u2020 Class Petromyzontida or Hyperoartia Petromyzontidae ( lampreys ) Class Conodonta ( conodonts ) \u2020 Class Cephalaspidomorphi \u2020 ( early jawless fish ) ( unranked ) Galeaspida \u2020 ( unranked ) Pituriaspida \u2020 ( unranked ) Osteostraci \u2020 Infraphylum Gnathostomata ( jawed vertebrates ) Class Placodermi \u2020 ( armoured fish ) Class Chondrichthyes ( cartilaginous fish ) Class Acanthodii \u2020 ( spiny sharks ) Superclass Osteichthyes ( bony fish ) Class Actinopterygii ( ray-finned fish ) Subclass Chondrostei Order Acipenseriformes ( sturgeons and paddlefishes ) Order Polypteriformes ( reedfishes and bichirs ) . Subclass Neopterygii Infraclass Holostei ( gars and bowfins ) Infraclass Teleostei ( many orders of common fish ) Class Sarcopterygii ( lobe-finned fish ) Subclass Actinistia ( coelacanths ) Subclass Dipnoi ( lungfish ) \u2020 \u2013 indicates extinct taxon Some palaeontologists contend that because Conodonta are chordates , they are primitive fish . For a fuller treatment of this taxonomy , see the vertebrate article . The position of hagfish in the phylum Chordata is not settled . Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group , the Cyclostomata , that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata . The various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species . There are almost 28,000 known extant species , of which almost 27,000 are bony fish , with 970 sharks , rays , and chimeras and about 108 hagfish and lampreys . A third of these species fall within the nine largest families ; from largest to smallest , these families are Cyprinidae , Gobiidae , Cichlidae , Characidae , Loricariidae , Balitoridae , Serranidae , Labridae , and Scorpaenidae . About 64 families are monotypic , containing only one species . The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500 . = = Diversity = = The term \" fish \" most precisely describes any non-tetrapod craniate ( i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone ) that has gills throughout life and whose limbs , if any , are in the shape of fins . Unlike groupings such as birds or mammals , fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic collection of taxa , including hagfishes , lampreys , sharks and rays , ray-finned fish , coelacanths , and lungfish . Indeed , lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of tetrapods ( such as mammals , birds , amphibians , etc . ) than of other fish such as ray-finned fish or sharks , so the last common ancestor of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods . As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern systematic biology , the use of the term \" fish \" as a biological group must be avoided . Many types of aquatic animals commonly referred to as \" fish \" are not fish in the sense given above ; examples include shellfish , cuttlefish , starfish , crayfish and jellyfish . In earlier times , even biologists did not make a distinction \u2013 sixteenth century natural historians classified also seals , whales , amphibians , crocodiles , even hippopotamuses , as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates , as fish . However , according to the definition above , all mammals , including cetaceans like whales and dolphins , are not fish . In some contexts , especially in aquaculture , the true fish are referred to as finfish ( or fin fish ) to distinguish them from these other animals . A typical fish is ectothermic , has a streamlined body for rapid swimming , extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen , has two sets of paired fins , usually one or two ( rarely three ) dorsal fins , an anal fin , and a tail fin , has jaws , has skin that is usually covered with scales , and lays eggs . Each criterion has exceptions . Tuna , swordfish , and some species of sharks show some warm-blooded adaptations \u2014 they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature . Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna , salmon , and jacks that can cover 10 \u2013 20 body-lengths per second to species such as eels and rays that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second . Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures . Lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods , gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function , while many catfish , such as corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach . Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable , covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses , pufferfish , anglerfish , and gulpers . Similarly , the surface of the skin may be naked ( as in moray eels ) , or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid ( typical of sharks and rays ) , cosmoid ( fossil lungfish and coelacanths ) , ganoid ( various fossil fish but also living gars and bichirs ) , cycloid , and ctenoid ( these last two are found on most bony fish ) . There are even fish that live mostly on land . Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows . The catfish Phreatobius cisternarum lives in underground , phreatic habitats , and a relative lives in waterlogged leaf litter . Fish range in size from the huge 16-metre ( 52 ft ) whale shark to the tiny 8-millimetre ( 0.3 in ) stout infantfish . Fish species diversity is roughly divided equally between marine ( oceanic ) and freshwater ecosystems . Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes , whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests , especially the Amazon , Congo , and Mekong basins . More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone , such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10 % of all vertebrate species on the Earth . Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin , such as Cant\u00e3o State Park , can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe . = = Anatomy = = = = = Respiration = = = = = = = Gills = = = = Most fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx . Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments . Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide . Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills . In some fish , capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water , causing countercurrent exchange . The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx . Some fish , like sharks and lampreys , possess multiple gill openings . However , bony fish have a single gill opening on each side . This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum . Juvenile bichirs have external gills , a very primitive feature that they share with larval amphibians . = = = = Air breathing = = = = Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods . Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days , or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water . Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms . The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly . The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air . Catfish of the families Loricariidae , Callichthyidae , and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts . Lungfish , with the exception of the Australian lungfish , and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills . Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way . Loaches , trahiras , and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut . Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin ( similar to frogs ) . A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air . Labyrinth fish ( such as gouramis and bettas ) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function . A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function , most notably snakeheads , pikeheads , and the Clariidae catfish family . Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow , seasonally variable waters where the water 's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline . Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen , such as perch and cichlids , quickly suffocate , while air-breathers survive for much longer , in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud . At the most extreme , some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water , entering a state of aestivation ( summertime hibernation ) until water returns . Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers . Obligate air breathers , such as the African lungfish , must breathe air periodically or they suffocate . Facultative air breathers , such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus , only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen . Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators . = = = Circulation = = = Fish have a closed-loop circulatory system . The heart pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body . In most fish , the heart consists of four parts , including two chambers and an entrance and exit . The first part is the sinus venosus , a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish 's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part , the atrium , which is a large muscular chamber . The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber , sends blood to the third part , ventricle . The ventricle is another thick-walled , muscular chamber and it pumps the blood , first to the fourth part , bulbus arteriosus , a large tube , and then out of the heart . The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta , through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation . = = = Digestion = = = Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food , including plants and other organisms . Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus . In the stomach , food is further digested and , in many fish , processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca , which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients . Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract . The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption . = = = Excretion = = = As with many aquatic animals , most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia . Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills . Blood wastes are filtered by the kidneys . Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis . Their kidneys return water to the body . The reverse happens in freshwater fish : they tend to gain water osmotically . Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion . Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function , allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater . = = = Scales = = = The scales of fish originate from the mesoderm ( skin ) ; they may be similar in structure to teeth . = = = Sensory and nervous system = = = = = = = Central nervous system = = = = Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates , typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal . However , some fish have relatively large brains , most notably mormyrids and sharks , which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials . Fish brains are divided into several regions . At the front are the olfactory lobes , a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves . The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell , such as hagfish , sharks , and catfish . Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon , the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates . In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction . Together these structures form the forebrain . Connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the diencephalon ( in the diagram , this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible ) . The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis . The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon . This structure detects light , maintains circadian rhythms , and controls color changes . The midbrain or mesencephalon contains the two optic lobes . These are very large in species that hunt by sight , such as rainbow trout and cichlids . The hindbrain or metencephalon is particularly involved in swimming and balance . The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain . Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae , while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense . The brain stem or myelencephalon is the brain 's posterior . As well as controlling some muscles and body organs , in bony fish at least , the brain stem governs respiration and osmoregulation . = = = = Sense organs = = = = Most fish possess highly developed sense organs . Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human 's ( see vision in fishes ) . Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell . Although they have ears , many fish may not hear very well . Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system , which detects gentle currents and vibrations , and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey . Some fish , such as catfish and sharks , have organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt . Other fish , like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes , can produce weak electric currents , which they use in navigation and social communication . Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols . Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination . = = = = = Vision = = = = = Vision is an important sensory system for most species of fish . Fish eyes are similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals , but have a more spherical lens . Their retinas generally have both rods and cones ( for scotopic and photopic vision ) , and most species have colour vision . Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light . Amongst jawless fish , the lamprey has well-developed eyes , while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots . Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment , for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment . = = = = = Hearing = = = = = Hearing is an important sensory system for most species of fish . Fish sense sound using their lateral lines and their ears . = = = = Capacity for pain = = = = Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have pain and fear responses . For instance , in Tavolga 's experiments , toadfish grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode . In 2003 , Scottish scientists at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals . Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks , which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain , similar to what mammals would do . Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns . Professor James D. Rose of the University of Wyoming claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess \" conscious awareness , particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours \" . Rose argues that since fish brains are so different from human brains , fish are probably not conscious in the manner humans are , so that reactions similar to human reactions to pain instead have other causes . Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a neocortex . However , animal behaviorist Temple Grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because \" different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions . \" Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling . Some countries , such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing , and the British RSPCA now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish . = = = Muscular system = = = Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone . These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body . As each curve reaches the back fin , backward force is applied to the water , and in conjunction with the fins , moves the fish forward . The fish 's fins function like an airplane 's flaps . Fins also increase the tail 's surface area , increasing speed . The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water . Since body tissue is denser than water , fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink . Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases . = = = Homeothermy = = = Although most fish are exclusively ectothermic , there are exceptions . Certain species of fish maintain elevated body temperatures . Endothermic teleosts ( bony fish ) are all in the suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes , tunas , and one species of \" primitive \" mackerel ( Gasterochisma melampus ) . All sharks in the family Lamnidae \u2013 shortfin mako , long fin mako , white , porbeagle , and salmon shark \u2013 are endothermic , and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae ( thresher sharks ) . The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish , which warm only their eyes and brain , to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20 \u00b0 C above ambient water temperatures . See also gigantothermy . Endothermy , though metabolically costly , is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength , higher rates of central nervous system processing , and higher rates of digestion . = = = Reproductive system = = = Fish reproductive organs include testicles and ovaries . In most species , gonads are paired organs of similar size , which can be partially or totally fused . There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness . In terms of spermatogonia distribution , the structure of teleosts testes has two types : in the most common , spermatogonia occur all along the seminiferous tubules , while in atherinomorph fish they are confined to the distal portion of these structures . Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic spermatogenesis in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules lumen . Fish ovaries may be of three types : gymnovarian , secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian . In the first type , the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium , then through the oviduct and are eliminated . Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct . In the third type , the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct . Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish , sturgeon , and bowfin . Cystovaries characterize most teleosts , where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct . Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids and a few other teleosts . Oogonia development in teleosts fish varies according to the group , and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes . Changes in the nucleus , ooplasm , and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process . Postovulatory follicles are structures formed after oocyte release ; they do not have endocrine function , present a wide irregular lumen , and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells . A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned . This process can also occur , but less frequently , in oocytes in other development stages . Some fish , like the California sheephead , are hermaphrodites , having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or , as in hamlets , have them simultaneously . Over 97 % of all known fish are oviparous , that is , the eggs develop outside the mother 's body . Examples of oviparous fish include salmon , goldfish , cichlids , tuna , and eels . In the majority of these species , fertilisation takes place outside the mother 's body , with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water . However , a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization , with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female , most notably the oviparous sharks , such as the horn shark , and oviparous rays , such as skates . In these cases , the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers . Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column . The eggs have an average diameter of 1 millimetre ( 0.039 in ) . The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae . They are usually poorly formed , carry a large yolk sac ( for nourishment ) , and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens . The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short ( usually only several weeks ) , and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure ( a process termed metamorphosis ) to become juveniles . During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey , a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density , starving many larvae . In ovoviviparous fish the eggs develop inside the mother 's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother , depending instead on the yolk . Each embryo develops in its own egg . Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include guppies , angel sharks , and coelacanths . Some species of fish are viviparous . In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos . Typically , viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother 's blood supply with that of the embryo . Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches , splitfins , and lemon shark . Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy , in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother . This has been observed primarily among sharks , such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle , but is known for a few bony fish as well , such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii . Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary , in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings . This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks , such as the grey nurse shark , but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii . Aquarists commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as livebearers . = = Diseases = = Like other animals , fish suffer from diseases and parasites . To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses . Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales , as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms . If pathogens breach these defenses , fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens . Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish 's body , i.e. , an immune response . In recent years , vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish , for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi . Some species use cleaner fish to remove external parasites . The best known of these are the Bluestreak cleaner wrasses of the genus Labroides found on coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans . These small fish maintain so-called \" cleaning stations \" where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners . Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups , including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus , Etroplus maculatus , the cleaner , and the much larger Etroplus suratensis . = = = Immune system = = = Immune organs vary by type of fish . In the jawless fish ( lampreys and hagfish ) , true lymphoid organs are absent . These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells . For example , erythrocytes , macrophages and plasma cells are produced in the anterior kidney ( or pronephros ) and some areas of the gut ( where granulocytes mature . ) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish . Cartilaginous fish ( sharks and rays ) have a more advanced immune system . They have three specialized organs that are unique to Chondrichthyes ; the epigonal organs ( lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone ) that surround the gonads , the Leydig 's organ within the walls of their esophagus , and a spiral valve in their intestine . These organs house typical immune cells ( granulocytes , lymphocytes and plasma cells ) . They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen ( their most important immune organ ) where various lymphocytes , plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored . Chondrostean fish ( sturgeons , paddlefish , and bichirs ) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the meninges ( membranes surrounding the central nervous system . ) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes , reticular cells and a small number of macrophages . The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ ; where erythrocytes , granulocytes , lymphocytes and macrophages develop . Like chondrostean fish , the major immune tissues of bony fish ( or teleostei ) include the kidney ( especially the anterior kidney ) , which houses many different immune cells . In addition , teleost fish possess a thymus , spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues ( e.g. in the skin , gills , gut and gonads ) . Much like the mammalian immune system , teleost erythrocytes , neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus . In 2006 , a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish , the zebrafish . Although not confirmed as yet , this system presumably will be where naive ( unstimulated ) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen . B and T lymphocytes bearing immunoglobulins and T cell receptors , respectively , are found in all jawed fishes . Indeed , the adaptive immune system as a whole evolved in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate . = = Conservation = = The 2006 IUCN Red List names 1,173 fish species that are threatened with extinction . Included are species such as Atlantic cod , Devil 's Hole pupfish , coelacanths , and great white sharks . Because fish live underwater they are more difficult to study than terrestrial animals and plants , and information about fish populations is often lacking . However , freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies . For example , the Devil 's Hole pupfish occupies only a single 3 by 6 metres ( 10 by 20 ft ) pool . = = = Overfishing = = = Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and tuna . Overfishing eventually causes population ( known as stock ) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed . Such commercial extinction does not mean that the species is extinct , merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery . One well-studied example of fishery collapse is the Pacific sardine Sadinops sagax caerulues fishery off the California coast . From a 1937 peak of 790,000 long tons ( 800,000 t ) the catch steadily declined to only 24,000 long tons ( 24,000 t ) in 1968 , after which the fishery was no longer economically viable . The main tension between fisheries science and the fishing industry is that the two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing . In places such as Scotland , Newfoundland , and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer , so governments are predisposed to support it . On the other hand , scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection , warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years . = = = Habitat destruction = = = A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution , the building of dams , removal of water for use by humans , and the introduction of exotic species . An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon , a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity . = = = Exotic species = = = Introduction of non-native species has occurred in many habitats . One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s . Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake 's 500 endemic cichlid species . Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes , but others are probably extinct . Carp , snakeheads , tilapia , European perch , brown trout , rainbow trout , and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments . = = Importance to humans = = = = = Economic importance = = = Throughout history , humans have utilized fish as a food source . Historically and today , most fish protein has come by means of catching wild fish . However , aquaculture , or fish farming , which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China , is becoming increasingly important in many nations . Overall , about one-sixth of the world 's protein is estimated to be provided by fish . That proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nations and regions heavily dependent on the sea . In a similar manner , fish have been tied to trade . Catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as fishing , while the organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a fishery . Fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people . The annual yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons , with popular species including herring , cod , anchovy , tuna , flounder , and salmon . However , the term fishery is broadly applied , and includes more organisms than just fish , such as mollusks and crustaceans , which are often called \" fish \" when used as food . = = = Recreation = = = Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food , appearing in cave art , being raised as ornamental fish in ponds , and displayed in aquariums in homes , offices , or public settings . Recreational fishing is fishing for pleasure or competition ; it can be contrasted with commercial fishing , which is fishing for profit . The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod , reel , line , hooks and any one of a wide range of baits . Angling is a method of fishing , specifically the practice of catching fish by means of an \" angle \" ( hook ) . Anglers must select the right hook , cast accurately , and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather conditions , species , fish response , time of the day , and other factors . = = = Culture = = = Fish feature prominently in art and literature , in movies such as Finding Nemo and books such as The Old Man and the Sea . Large fish , particularly sharks , have frequently been the subject of horror movies and thrillers , most notably the novel Jaws , which spawned a series of films of the same name that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as Shark Tale and Snakehead Terror . Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as Piranha ; however , contrary to popular belief , the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans . In the Book of Jonah a \" great fish \" swallowed Jonah the Prophet . Legends of half-human , half-fish mermaids have featured in folklore , like the stories of Hans Christian Andersen . Fish themes have symbolic significance in many religions . The fish is used often as a symbol by Christians to represent Jesus , or Christianity in general ; the gospels also refer to \" fishers of men \" and feeding the multitude . In the dhamma of Buddhism the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water . Often drawn in the form of carp which are regarded in the Orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty , size and life-span . Among the deities said to take the form of a fish are Ika-Roa of the Polynesians , Dagon of various ancient Semitic peoples , the shark-gods of Hawai\u02bbi and Matsya of the Hindus . The astrological symbol Pisces is based on a constellation of the same name , but there is also a second fish constellation in the night sky , Piscis Austrinus . = = Terminology = = = = = Shoal or school = = = A random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation . When fish come together in an interactive , social grouping , then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending on the degree of organisation . A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour , such as swimming speed , so that it remains close to the other members of the group . Schools of fish are much more tightly organised , synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction . Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages . Examples : Cichlids congregating at lekking sites form an aggregation . Many minnows and characins form shoals . Anchovies , herrings and silversides are classic examples of schooling fish . While the words \" school \" and \" shoal \" have different meanings within biology , they are often treated as synonyms by non-specialists , with speakers of British English using \" shoal \" to describe any grouping of fish , and speakers of American English often using \" school \" just as loosely . = = = Fish or fishes = = = Though often used interchangeably , in biology these words have different meanings . Fish is used as a singular noun , or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species . Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups . Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish . But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species , it would be said to contain three fishes . The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples . = = = Finfish = = = In biology , the term fish is most strictly used to describe any animal with a backbone that has gills throughout life and has limbs , if any , in the shape of fins . Many types of aquatic animals with common names ending in \" fish \" are not fish in this sense ; examples include shellfish , cuttlefish , starfish , crayfish and jellyfish . In earlier times , even biologists did not make a distinction \u2014 sixteenth century natural historians classified also seals , whales , amphibians , crocodiles , even hippopotamuses , as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates , as fish . In fisheries , the term fish is used as a collective term , and includes mollusks , crustaceans and any aquatic animal which is harvested . The strict biological definition of a fish , above , is sometimes called a true fish . True fish are also referred to as finfish or fin fish to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture .",

                    "text": "Boobrie = The boobrie is a mythological shapeshifting entity inhabiting the lochs of the west coast of Scotland . It commonly adopts the appearance of a gigantic water bird resembling a cormorant or great northern diver , but it can also materialise in the form of various other mythological creatures such as a water bull . A generally malevolent entity , the boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships , but it is also fond of otters , of which it consumes a considerable number . In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the top of lochs as if on solid ground . During the summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect , sucking the blood of horses . Folklorist Campbell of Islay has speculated that descriptions of the boobrie may be based on sightings of the great auk . The bellowing sound made by the boobrie , more like a bull than a bird , may have its origin in the strange call of the common bittern , which was a rare visitor to Scotland . = = Etymology = = Boobrie may derive from boibhre , meaning cow giver or cow bestowing . Edward Dwelly , a Scottish lexicographer , lists tarbh-boidhre as \" Monster , demon \" and \" God capable of changing himself into many forms \" ; tarbh-aoidhre is given as a northern counties variation . The simpler component of tarbh as a single word is defined by Dwelly as \" bull . \" Transcribers of the tale have used several differing spellings of the second component , some even adopting inconsistent variations throughout their own renditions . George Henderson for instance , a folklorist and Celtic scholar , used five alternatives : bo 'eithre ; boidhre ; bo-oibhre ; eithre ; and fhaire . Spelling variations employed by other writers include aoidhre ; baoighre ; baoidhre ; boidhre ; eighre ; and oire . = = Folk beliefs = = = = = Description and common attributes = = = Investigation into folklore , especially Celtic oral traditions , began in the 19th-century , and several \" bizarre \" and less familiar beasts were identified , including the boobrie . It is a generally malevolent entity , with the ability to materialise in the form of various mythical creatures . It commonly preys on animals being transported on ships , preferably calves , but will also happily eat lambs and sheep , carrying its prey away to the deepest water before consuming it . It is also extremely fond of otters , which it consumes in large quantities . In its favoured bird manifestation the boobrie resembles a gigantic great northern diver or cormorant , but with white markings . According to folklorist Campbell of Islay , a detailed account of its dimensions provided by an authoritative source claims that it is \" larger than seventeen of the biggest eagles put together \" . It has a strong black beak about 11 inches ( 280 mm ) wide and 17 inches ( 430 mm ) in length , the final 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of which taper like that of an eagle . The creature 's neck is almost 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) long with a girth of a little under 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) . Short black powerful legs lead to webbed feet with gigantic claws . An imprint of a boobrie 's foot left in some lakeside mud equalled \" the span of a large wide-spreading pair of red deer 's horns \" . It bellows noisily with displeasure , sounding more like a bull than a bird . The design of its wings is more conducive to swimming rather than for flight . Its evil powers when in the form of a bird were said by Campbell of Islay to have \" terrified a minister out of his propriety \" . The boobrie 's insatiable appetite for livestock posed a threat to local farmers , as they relied on their animals as a means of providing income and food . Although sea lochs are the boobries ' natural home they will shelter on land in overgrown heather . Accounts are inconsistent as to the extent of the boobrie 's habitat . Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire , as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop . The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature 's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands , although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire . Campbell of Islay 's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat . = = = = Alternative manifestations = = = = When manifested as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the top of lochs ; the beating noise of the creature 's hooves on the water is the same as if it were galloping on solid ground . Henderson reproduced parts of Campbell of Islay 's manuscripts when writing Survivals in belief among the Celts ( 1911 ) . Among them is a story listed as \" boobrie as tarbh uisge \" . The tale starts by detailing how a man named Eachann fed a colossal black bull when he discovered it writhing in pain and possibly close to death at the side of Loch nan Dobhran , on the west coast of Argyll . Some months later , Phemie , Eachann 's girlfriend , is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on the loch , which make her think of Murdoch , her former paramour . While she sat dreaming of Eachann one evening when staying at a sheiling near the loch , she sensed the flicker of a shadow behind her , except this time it was Murdoch . He promptly overpowered her by enveloping her in a blanket and tying her hands . At that point , a water bull came to Phemie 's rescue by knocking Murdoch to the ground . The bull then knelt down allowing Phemie to get on its back , before transporting her at the speed of light back to the home of her mother . The bull disappeared never to be seen again but a \" voice was heard in the air calling out loudly \" . The verse heard was in Gaelic , and translates as : It is then asserted that the tale \" reveals the persistence in folk-belief of the idea of transformation , the boobrie being the abode of a spirit \" . The boobrie can also manifest itself in the form of a large insect that sucks the blood of horses . Henderson refers to it as a \" big striped brown gobhlachan or ear-wig \" with \" lots of tentacles or feelers \" . It was infrequently seen in this form , usually only at the height of the summer , during August and September . = = = Capture and hunting = = = A farmer and his son were ploughing a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa , but work stalled after one of the horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue . Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement . Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task , and initially worked steadily . As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch , it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue . It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie , giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch , pulling the plough and the other three horses with it . The frightened farmer and his son watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater , taking the other horses and plough with it . Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses . In a story transcribed by John Campbell of Kilberry , a hunter attempted to shoot a boobrie after he spotted it in its bird-like manifestation on a sea loch one chilly February day . The man paddled into the loch until the water was up to his shoulders , but when he was about 85 yards ( 78 m ) from the creature it dived under the water . The hunter maintained his position for forty-five minutes before returning to the shore , where he remained for a further six hours waiting unsuccessfully for the boobrie to resurface . No clear indication is given of the loch 's whereabouts . = = Origins = = Campbell of Islay speculates that the boobrie may have originated from sightings of the great auk . He noted he had been told stories of the creature by various people , and regarded it as having \" a real existence in the popular mind \" . He considered the tale of the boobrie in its water horse manifestation resembled the Norse myth of \" the ploughing of the Asa \" . Referring to Forbes ' 1905 dictionary of \" Gaelic names of beasts \" in which bubaire is defined as a common bittern , and a detailed description given by scholar James Logie Robertson of the bull o ' the bog ( an alternative name for a bittern ) in The Scotsman in 1908 , Henderson hypothesises that the boobrie may stem from the bittern . Referring to the bittern 's \" strangely weird sound \" and highlighting its \" weird hollow cry \" during the night and throughout the evening , he describes it as resembling quietly bellowing cattle , particularly during the bird 's breeding season . Records indicate that the bird was rare in Scotland but had been sighted in the first decade of the 20th century , although catching sight of a bittern was believed to be a harbinger of death or disaster .",

                    "text": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A. Richardson , Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Sanborn Contracts- 1874 ) ( Resigned and appointed Federal Judge by Grant . ) George H. Williams , Attorney General \u2013 ( Pratt & Boyd- 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Columbus Delano , Secretary of Interior \u2013 ( Bogus Agents \u2013 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Orville E. Babcock , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Black Friday \u2013 1869 ) ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Safe Burglary Conspiracy \u2013 1876 ) ( Acquitted in Saint Louis Whiskey Ring trials by jury due to Grant 's defense testimony in his favor . ) John McDonald , Internal Revenue Supervisor , St. Louis \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Indicted and convicted ; served prison time ; claimed Grant was involved in the Whiskey Ring but did not supply any evidence . ) Horace Porter , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) William W. Belknap , Secretary of War \u2013 ( Trading Post Ring- 1876 ) ( Resigned ; Convicted by House ; acquitted by Senate ; indictments against Belknap in Washington D.C. court were dropped by judge at request of Grant and Attorney General Alphonso Taft . ) George M. Robeson , Secretary of Navy \u2013 ( Naval Department Ring- 1876 ) ( Grant defended Robeson in State of the Union address . Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P.

Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

She was built by the Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando shipyard ; her keel was laid in July 1891 , she was launched in May 1894 , and was commissioned in December 1895 . Her main armament were her five torpedo tubes , which were supported by a battery of eleven small-caliber guns . Calatafimi spent most of her career in the main Italian fleet , where she was primarily occupied with training exercises . The ship was sold in March 1907 and broken up for scrap . = = Design = = Calatafimi was 73.1 meters ( 239 ft 10 in ) long overall and had a beam of 8.22 m ( 27 ft 0 in ) and an average draft of 3.48 m ( 11 ft 5 in ) . She displaced 839 metric tons ( 826 long tons ; 925 short tons ) normally . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal triple-expansion steam engines , each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by four coal-fired locomotive boilers . Specific figures for Calatafimi 's engine performance have not survived , but the ships of her class had top speeds of 18.1 to 20.8 knots ( 33.5 to 38.5 km / h ; 20.8 to 23.9 mph ) at 3,884 to 4,422 indicated horsepower ( 2,896 to 3,297 kW ) . The ship had a cruising radius of about 1,800 nautical miles ( 3,300 km ; 2,100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of between 96 and 121 personnel . Calatafimi was armed with a main battery of one 120 mm ( 4.7 in ) / 40 gun and six 57 mm ( 2.2 in ) / 43 guns mounted singly.\u03b1 She was also equipped with three 37 mm ( 1.5 in ) / 20 guns in single mounts . Her primary offensive weapon was her six 450 mm ( 17.7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to 1.6 in ( 41 mm ) thick ; her conning tower was armored with the same thickness of steel plate . = = Service history = = The new cruiser was originally to have been named Tersicore , but she was renamed Calatafimi the day construction began . The last member of her class , Calatafimi was laid down on 15 September 1891 at the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia ( Royal Dockyard in Castellammare di Stabia ) , and was launched on 18 March 1893 . After fitting-out work was completed , the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 16 January 1894 . The following year , she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Permanent Squadron , which included her sister ship Euridice , the ironclad battleship Francesco Morosini , and the protected cruiser Etruria . The Squadron was based at La Spezia at the time , though Calatafimi was stationed primarily in Taranto and Naples , along with most of the other torpedo cruisers of the Italian fleet . In 1895 , unrest in the Ottoman Empire that killed hundreds of foreign nationals prompted several of the European great powers to send an international fleet to pressure the Ottomans into compensating the victims . In November , a small Italian squadron sent to Smyrna to join the fleet in there ; Calatafimi was mobilized as part of a larger force in Naples that consisted of the ironclads Francesco Morosini , Lepanto , and Ruggiero di Lauria , the protected cruiser Elba , the torpedo cruiser Folgore , and five torpedo boats . This second squadron was stocked with coal and ammunition in the event that it would need to reinforce the squadron at Smryna . In 1896 , she took part in the annual summer maneuvers in July as part of the First Division of the Reserve Squadron , which also included the ironclads Re Umberto and Lepanto and the protected cruiser Ettore Fieramosca . In 1898 , Calatafimi was assigned to the Reserve Squadron , which included the ironclads Lepanto , Francesco Morosini , and Ruggiero di Lauria , three protected cruisers , and the torpedo cruiser Goito . The following year , she returned to the Active Squadron , where she served with six ironclads , the armored cruiser Vettor Pisani , the protected cruiser Lombardia , and Goito . The ship was sold for scrap in March 1907 and subsequently broken up .",

The ship was commissioned into the German fleet on 15 October 1896 , where she served on active duty for the entirety of her peacetime career . During the 1900 summer maneuvers , \u00c4gir served in the simulated hostile squadron , alongside Heimdall , Hildebrand , and Siegfried . The maneuvers lasted from 15 August to 15 September . In 1901 , \u00c4gir was taken in hand at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers and her length was increased to 86.15 m ( 282.6 ft ) . This increased her displacement to 4,376 t ( 4,307 long tons ; 4,824 short tons ) at full load . The lengthened hull , which improved her hydrodynamic shape , and the improved boilers increased her speed by a full knot , to 15.5 knots ( 28.7 km / h ; 17.8 mph ) . Her coal storage was increased to 580 t ( 570 long tons ; 640 short tons ) , which allowed her to steam for an additional 800 nmi ( 1,500 km ; 920 mi ) . The modernization work was completed by 1903 , at which point she returned to active service . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , \u00c4gir was assigned to the VI Battle Squadron , along with her sister Odin and the six Siegfried-class coastal defense ships .

She was named after the German name for Germany , and built at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , where she was launched on 20 November 1904 . She was commissioned on 3 August 1906 , only a few months before HMS Dreadnought was commissioned , the first of a revolutionary new standard of \" all-big-gun \" battleships which rendered Deutschland and the rest of her class obsolete . She served as the flagship of Prince Heinrich until 1913 . With the outbreak of World War I in mid-1914 , Deutschland and her sisters were tasked with defending the mouth of the Elbe and the German Bight from possible British incursions while the rest of the fleet was being mobilized . Deutschland and the other four ships of her class were then attached to the High Seas Fleet as the II Battle Squadron ; the unit participated in most of the large-scale fleet actions in the first two years of war , culminating in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May \u2013 1 June 1916 . Late on the first day of the battle , Deutschland and the other pre-dreadnoughts briefly engaged several British battlecruisers before retreating . After the battle , Deutschland and her three surviving sisters were assigned to coastal defense duties . By 1917 , they had been withdrawn from combat service completely and tasked with auxiliary roles . Deutschland was used as a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven until the end of the war .

She was laid down on 20 July 1903 at the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel , and launched on 19 November 1904 . Her trials lasted from 3 August 1906 until September . The British battleship HMS Dreadnought \u2014 armed with ten 12 inch ( 30.5 cm ) guns \u2014 was commissioned in December 1906 . Dreadnought 's revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete , including Deutschland . Deutschland was 127.6 m ( 418 ft 8 in ) long , had a beam of 22.2 m ( 72 ft 10 in ) , and a draft of 8.21 m ( 26 ft 11 in ) . She had a full-load displacement of 14,218 metric tons ( 13,993 long tons ) and was equipped with coal-fired triple expansion engines that produced a rated 15,781 indicated horsepower ( 11,768 kW ) and gave her a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . At a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , she could steam for 4,850 nautical miles ( 8,980 km ; 5,580 mi ) .

She was also equipped with fourteen 17 cm ( 6.7 in ) guns mounted in casemates , twenty 8.8 cm ( 3.46 in ) guns in pivot mounts , and six 45 cm ( 17.72 in ) torpedo tubes were submerged in the hull . = = Service history = = On 26 September 1906 the ship officially joined the fleet , when Admiral Prince Heinrich made her his flagship . She was tactically assigned to the II Battle Squadron , though as the fleet flagship she was not subordinate to the Squadron commander . She took part in training exercises in the North Sea in December 1906 before returning to Kiel . On 16 February 1907 , the fleet was renamed the High Seas Fleet . Fleet maneuvers in the North Sea followed in early 1907 and again in May \u2013 June . A cruise to Norway followed the fleet training in June . After returning from Norway , Deutschland went to Swinem\u00fcnde . Another round of fleet training followed in September 1907 . In November , she was taken into drydock for an annual refit . Deutschland participated in fleet maneuvers in February 1908 in the Baltic Sea ; in May \u2013 June training was conducted off the island fortress of Helgoland in the North Sea . In July 1908 , Deutschland and the rest of the fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean to conduct training there . During the cruise , Deutschland stopped at Funchal and Santa Cruz de Tenerife . The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August . The following month another set of training maneuvers was conducted in the Baltic and North Seas , with a winter cruise into the Baltic afterward . The following year \u2014 1909 \u2014 followed much the same pattern . Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August , during which Deutschland stopped in Bilbao . After another round of exercises , Deutschland went in for another periodic overhaul . During the refit , she was given additional pedestal-mounted search lights , as well as becoming the first ship in the German navy to be equipped with an X-ray machine . In May 1910 , the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat , between Norway and Denmark . The annual summer cruise went to Norway , and was followed by fleet training . In November , Deutschland hosted Kaiser Wilhelm II during the celebration of the opening of the Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik . A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year . The next two years followed the same pattern of training exercises and cruises to Norway in the summer , with the exception of 1912 when , due to the Agadir Crisis , the cruise only went into the Baltic . In September , following maneuvers , Deutschland was partially grounded in the Baltic . The damage necessitated dry-docking , and repairs were completed by November . In January 1913 , the new dreadnought battleship Friedrich der Grosse replaced Deutschland as the flagship of the fleet . The golden bow ornament that denoted the flagship was removed , and Deutschland returned to the ranks of the II Battle Squadron . = = = World War I = = = At the outbreak of war , the ship was deployed to the mouth of the Elbe to guard the area . Deutschland remained with the High Seas Fleet in the II Battle Squadron for the first two years of the war . While her sisters covered the raid on the English coast on 15 \u2013 16 December , Deutschland remained on picket duty in the mouth of the Elbe . On 21 February 1915 , Deutschland went into dock in Kiel , where work lasted until 12 March . Afterward , Deutschland returned to the Elbe for guard duty . On 21 September the ship went to the Baltic for training , which was completed by 11 October , after which she went into the dockyard in Kiel again for maintenance . Deutschland went to the AG Vulcan drydock in Hamburg for additional work from 27 February to 1 April 1916 . After returning to the fleet , Deutschland was made the flagship of the II Battle Squadron under the command of Admiral Franz Mauve . On 24 \u2013 25 April 1916 , Deutschland and her four sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group on a raid of the English coast . While en route to the target , the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a mine ; she was detached to return home while the operation proceeded . The battlecruisers conducted a short bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft . Visibility was poor , and the operation was called off before the British fleet could intervene . On 4 May , Deutschland took part in a sortie against British ships off Horns Reef , without result . = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = Admiral Scheer immediately planned another foray into the North Sea , but the damage to Seydlitz delayed the operation until the end of May . Deutschland was the first ship in the III Division of the II Battle Squadron and the flagship of Rear Admiral Franz Mauve . The II Battle Squadron , with the weakest battleships involved in the battle , was positioned at the rear of the German line . During the \" Run to the North , \" Admiral Reinhard Scheer , the commander of the fleet , ordered the fleet to pursue the retreating battleships of the British V Battle Squadron at top speed . Deutschland and her sisters were significantly slower than the dreadnoughts , and quickly fell behind . By 19 : 30 , the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Admiral Scheer with significant numerical superiority . The German fleet was severely hampered by the presence of the slower Deutschland-class ships ; if Scheer ordered an immediate turn towards Germany , he would have to sacrifice the slower ships to make good his escape . Admiral Scheer reversed the course of the fleet via the Gefechtskehrtwendung ( ' battle turn ' ) , a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180 \u00b0 simultaneously . Having fallen behind , the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn . Deutschland and the other five ships of the squadron were therefore on the disengaged side of the German line . Admiral Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line , astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts , but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper 's battlecruisers . Instead , he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line . Later on the first day of the battle , the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents . Deutschland and the other so-called \" five-minute ships \" came to their aid by steaming between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons . Poor visibility made the subsequent engagement brief . Deutschland fired only one round from her 28 cm guns during this period . Admiral Mauve decided it would be inadvisable to continue the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers , and so ordered an 8-point turn to starboard . Late on the 31st , the fleet organized for the night march back to Germany ; Deutschland , Pommern , and Hannover fell in behind K\u00f6nig and the other dreadnoughts of the III Battle Squadron towards the rear of the line . British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet , some of which targeted Deutschland . In the melee , Deutschland and K\u00f6nig turned away from the attacking destroyers , but could not make out targets clearly enough to engage them effectively . Soon after , Pommern was struck by at least one torpedo and exploded . Fragments of the ship rained down around Deutschland . Regardless , the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4 : 00 on 1 June . The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later , where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the Nassau and Helgoland classes took up defensive positions . = = = Later career = = = After Jutland , Deutschland and her sisters returned to picket duty in the mouth of the Elbe . They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic . From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917 , Deutschland lay idle in the Bay of Kiel . On 24 January , the ship was taken to Hamburg where she went into the drydock for maintenance ; this work lasted until 4 April . Deutschland sailed out of the Altenbruch roads at the mouth of the Elbe and then to the Baltic for continued guard duty . On 15 August , the II Battle Squadron was disbanded ; two weeks later , on 31 August , Deutschland arrived in Kiel and was decommissioned on 10 September . Deutschland had her guns removed in Kiel before she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven to serve as a barracks ship . On 25 January 1920 the ship was struck from the naval register and sold for scrapping , which was complete by 1922 . The ship 's bow ornament is on display at the Eckernf\u00f6rde underwater weapons school and her bell is located in the mausoleum of Prince Heinrich at the Hemmelmark estate .",

Braunschweig saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy . In August 1915 , the ship participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga , during which she engaged the Russian battleship Slava . In 1916 , the ship was placed in reserve owing to crew shortages . She spent the remainder of World War I as a training ship , and after 1917 , as a barracks ship for U-boat crews . Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , she was retained after the end of the war and modernized in 1921 \u2013 22 . Braunschweig served in the reformed Reichsmarine as a coastal defense ship until 1926 , when she was again placed in reserve . She was stricken in 1931 and subsequently broken up for scrap . = = Construction = = Braunschweig was laid down in 1901 , at the Germaniawerft in Kiel under construction number 97 . The first of her class , she was ordered under the contract name \" H \" as a new unit for the fleet . The ship cost 23,983,000 marks . Braunschweig was launched on 20 December 1902 and commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1904 . The ship was 127.70 m ( 419 ft 0 in ) long overall and had a beam of 22.20 m ( 72 ft 10 in ) and a draft of 8.10 m ( 26 ft 7 in ) forward . The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws . Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Braunschweig 's powerplant was rated at 16,000 indicated horsepower ( 12,000 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Braunschweig 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 28 cm ( 11 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17 cm ( 6.7 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and eighteen 8.8 cm ( 3.45 in ) SK L / 35 quick-firing guns . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all mounted submerged in the hull . = = Service history = = Upon commissioning in October 1904 , Braunschweig was assigned to the II Division of the II Squadron of the German fleet . She was joined by her sister Elsass the following month ; the II Division was rounded out by the old battleship Weissenburg . The German Navy in 1905 consisted of four divisions of three battleships each , with two divisions per squadron . This was supported by a cruiser division , composed of two armored cruisers and six protected cruisers . After the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Braunschweig was assigned to the IV Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet . The squadron was commanded by Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt . In July 1915 , following the loss of the minelaying cruiser SMS Albatross in the Baltic , the IV Squadron ships were transferred to reinforce the German naval forces in the area . On 11 and 19 July , German cruisers , with the IV Squadron ships in support , conducted sweeps in the Baltic , though without engaging Russian forces . In August 1915 , the German fleet attempted to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces , in order to aid the German Army advancing on the city . The IV Squadron was joined by the I Squadron , which consisted of the eight Nassau and Helgoland-class battleships , from the High Seas Fleet , along with three battlecruisers and a host of smaller craft . The task force was placed under command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper , though operational command remained with Vice Admiral Schmidt . On the morning of 8 August , the Germans made their initial push into the Gulf ; Braunschweig and Elsass were tasked with engaging the Russian pre-dreadnought Slava and preventing her from disrupting the German minesweepers . However , when it became clear that the minesweepers could not clear the minefield before nightfall , Schmidt called off the attempt . A second attempt was made on 16 August ; this time , Braunschweig remained outside the Gulf while the dreadnoughts Nassau and Posen took over the task of dealing with Slava . By 19 August , the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf . Reports of Allied submarines in the area , however , prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day . On 12 October , the British submarine E18 fired a single torpedo at Braunschweig , though it failed to hit its target . Due to manpower shortages , the IV Squadron ships were demobilized . In 1916 , Braunschweig became a training ship . On 20 August 1917 , she was transferred for use as a barracks ship stationed in Kiel . In this role , the ship supported the III Submarine Flotilla . The Treaty of Versailles , which ended the war , specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the \" Deutschland or Lothringen types . \" Braunschweig was chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed Reichsmarine . The ship was modernized at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven from 1921 \u2013 22 . In 1923 , Braunschweig 's bridge was rebuilt and enlarged . She and Elsass , along with the Deutschland-class battleship Schlesien , were assigned to the North Sea Station . The ship served with the fleet until 1926 , when she was withdrawn from active duty and placed in reserve . On 31 March 1931 , Braunschweig was stricken from the naval register and temporarily used as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven before being broken up for scrap .",

                    "text": "Italian ironclad Ruggiero di Lauria = Ruggiero di Lauria was an ironclad battleship built in the 1880s for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) . She was the lead ship of the Ruggiero di Lauria class , which included two other ships , Francesco Morosini and Andrea Doria . Ruggiero di Lauria , named for the medieval Sicilian admiral Ruggiero di Lauria , was armed with a main battery of four 17-inch ( 432 mm ) guns , was protected with 17.75-inch ( 451 mm ) thick belt armor , and was capable of a top speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . The ship 's construction period was very lengthy , beginning in August 1881 and completing in February 1888 . She was quickly rendered obsolescent by the new pre-dreadnought battleships being laid down and , as a result , her career was limited . She spent her career alternating between the Active and Reserve Squadrons , where she took part in training exercises each year with the rest of the fleet . The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1909 and converted into a floating oil tank . She was used in this capacity until 1943 , when she was sunk by bombs during World War II . The wreck was eventually raised and scrapped in 1945 . = = Design = = Ruggiero di Lauria was 105.9 meters ( 347 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 19.84 m ( 65.1 ft ) and an average draft of 8.29 m ( 27.2 ft ) . She displaced 9,886 metric tons ( 9,730 long tons ; 10,897 short tons ) normally and up to 10,997 t ( 10,823 long tons ; 12,122 short tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of compound steam engines each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by eight coal-fired , cylindrical fire-tube boilers . Her engines produced a top speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) at 10,591 indicated horsepower ( 7,898 kW ) . She could steam for 2,800 nautical miles ( 5,200 km ; 3,200 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 507 \u2013 509 officers and men . Ruggiero di Lauria was armed with a main battery of four 17 in ( 432 mm ) / 27 guns , mounted in two pairs en echelon in a central barbette . She carried a secondary battery of two 6 in ( 152 mm ) / 32 guns , one at the bow and the other at the stern , and four 4.7 in ( 119 mm ) / 32 guns . As was customary for capital ships of the period , she carried five 14 in ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . She was protected by belt armor that was 17.75 in ( 451 mm ) thick , an armored deck that was 3 in ( 76 mm ) thick , and her conning tower was armored with 9.8 in ( 249 mm ) of steel plate . The barbette had 14.2 in ( 361 mm ) of steel armor . = = Service history = = Ruggiero di Lauria was laid down at the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia shipyard on 3 August 1881 and launched on 9 August 1884 . She was not completed for another three and a half years , her construction finally being finished on 1 February 1888 . Because of the rapid pace of naval technological development in the late 19th century , her lengthy construction period meant that she was an obsolete design by the time she entered service . The year after she entered service , the British began building the Royal Sovereign class , the first pre-dreadnought battleships , which marked a significant step forward in capital ship design . In addition , technological progress , particularly in armor production techniques \u2014 first Harvey armor and then Krupp armor \u2014 rapidly rendered older vessels like Ruggiero di Lauria obsolete . The ship served with the 1st Division of the Active Squadron during the 1893 fleet maneuvers , along with the ironclad Lepanto , which served as the divisional flagship , the torpedo cruisers Euridice and Monzambano , and four torpedo boats . During the maneuvers , which lasted from 6 August to 5 September , the ships of the Active Squadron simulated a French attack on the Italian fleet . In 1895 , Ruggiero di Lauria , the ironclad Sardegna , and the torpedo cruiser Partenope were assigned to the 2nd Division of the Italian fleet in the Reserve Squadron . At the time , the ships of the Reserve Squadron were based in La Spezia . Ruggiero di Lauria joined the ironclads Re Umberto , Sardegna , and Andrea Doria and the cruisers Stromboli , Etruria , and Partenope for a visit to Spithead in the United Kingdom in July 1895 . Later that year , the squadron stopped in Germany for the celebration held to mark the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal . For the periodic fleet maneuvers of 1897 , Ruggiero di Lauria was assigned to the First Division of the Reserve Squadron , which also included the ironclads Caio Duilio and Lepanto and the protected cruiser Lombardia . The following year , the Reserve Squadron consisted of Ruggiero di Lauria , Francesco Morosini , Lepanto , and five cruisers . In 1899 , Ruggiero di Lauria , Andrea Doria , Sicilia , and Sardegna took part in a naval review in Cagliari for the Italian King Umberto I , which included a French and British squadron as well . That year , Ruggiero di Lauria and her two sisters served in the Active Squadron , which was kept in service for eight months of the year , with the remainder spent with reduced crews . The Squadron also included the ironclads Re Umberto , Sicilia , and Lepanto . In 1900 , Ruggiero di Lauria and her sisters were significantly modified and received a large number of small guns for defense against torpedo boats . These included a pair of 75 mm ( 3.0 in ) guns , ten 57 mm ( 2.2 in ) 40-caliber guns , twelve 37 mm ( 1.5 in ) guns , five 37 mm revolver cannon , and two machine guns . In 1905 , Ruggiero di Lauria and her two sisters were joined in the Reserve Squadron by the three Re Umberto-class ironclads and Enrico Dandolo , three cruisers , and sixteen torpedo boats . This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers , and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews . During the annual training maneuvers in October 1906 , a severe storm swept a man overboard , drowning him . During a gunnery competition held during the maneuvers , Ruggiero di Lauria 's gunners came in last place . In 1908 , the Italian Navy decided to discard Ruggiero di Lauria and her sister Francesco Morosini . The former was stricken from the naval register on 11 November 1909 . The ship was then converted into a floating oil depot . She was renamed GM45 and stationed at La Spezia until 1943 , when she was sunk in shallow water by an air raid during World War II . Her wreck was scrapped after the end of the war in 1945 .",

For a period of 64 days , she roamed the North Sea and eventually the North Atlantic as far west as Nova Scotia in search of any Allied convoys heading to Great Britain . During that time she encountered three enemy vessels . The first confrontation took place on the 13th , just eight days after leaving port , when she came across the British merchant vessel SS Somersby and sank her just south of Iceland . On 20 May , the submarine came across the tanker San Felix and fired a torpedo at her , causing damage to her hull but failing to sink her . Two days later , U-111 sank the second and last enemy vessel of her patrol , the Barnby , south of Greenland . After these victories , the boat returned to port .

                    "text": "Bremen-class cruiser = The Bremen class was a group of seven light cruisers built for the Imperial German Navy in the early 1900s . The seven ships , Bremen , Hamburg , Berlin , L\u00fcbeck , M\u00fcnchen , Leipzig , and Danzig , were an improvement upon the previous Gazelle class . They were significantly larger than the earlier class , and were faster and better armored . Like the Gazelles , they were armed with a main battery of ten 10.5 cm SK L / 40 guns and a pair of torpedo tubes . The ships of the Bremen class served in a variety of roles , from overseas cruiser to fleet scout to training ship . Bremen and Leipzig were deployed to the American and Asian stations , respectively , while the other five ships remained in German waters with the High Seas Fleet . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Leipzig was in the Pacific Ocean in the East Asia Squadron ; she saw action at the Battle of Coronel in November and was sunk a month later at the Battle of the Falkland Islands . Bremen was sunk by a Russian mine in December 1915 , but the other five ships of the class survived the war . Three of the surviving ships , L\u00fcbeck , M\u00fcnchen , and Danzig , were seized by Britain as war prizes after the end of the war and sold for scrapping . The other two ships , Hamburg and Berlin , were used as training cruisers through the 1920s . They were converted into barracks ships in the mid-1930s , a role they filled for a decade ; in 1944 , Hamburg was sunk by British bombers and later broken up for scrap , while Berlin was scuttled in deep water after the end of World War II to dispose of a load of chemical weapons . = = Design = = The 1898 Naval Law authorized the construction of 30 new light cruisers by 1904 ; the Gazelle-class cruiser filled the requirements for the first ten vessels.The design for the Bremen class was an improved version of the preceding Gazelle class , the improvements chiefly being in size and speed . To accommodate the more powerful propulsion system , a third funnel was added . The armored deck was also thickened significantly . The fourth ship of the class , L\u00fcbeck , was fitted with steam turbines , so the quality of turbine engines could be compared with otherwise identical vessels . The Bremen class was followed by the K\u00f6nigsberg class , which was very similar to the Bremens , including the same armament . And like the Bremens , one ship of the class , Stettin , was equipped with turbine engines while the rest had traditional triple-expansion engine . = = = General characteristics = = = The Bremen-class ships were 110.6 meters ( 362 ft 10 in ) long at the waterline and 111.1 m ( 364 ft 6 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 13.3 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 5.28 to 5.68 m ( 17.3 to 18.6 ft ) forward . They displaced 3,278 metric tons ( 3,226 long tons ) as designed and between 3,652 to 3,816 t ( 3,594 to 3,756 long tons ; 4,026 to 4,206 short tons ) at full combat load . The ships ' hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames , and incorporated twelve watertight compartments . The hulls also had a double bottom that ran for 56 percent of the length of the hull . All seven ships were good sea boats , but they were crank and rolled up to twenty degrees . They were also very wet at high speeds and suffered from a slight weather helm . Nevertheless , the ships turned tightly and were very maneuverable . In a hard turn , their speed fell up to 35 percent . They had a transverse metacentric height of .58 to .61 m ( 1 ft 11 in to 2 ft 0 in ) . The ships had a standard crew of fourteen officers and between 274 and 287 enlisted men , though later in their careers , these figures increased to 19 and 330 , respectively . The Bremen-class ships carried a number of smaller boats , including one picket boat , one pinnace , two cutters , two yawls , and one dinghy . = = = Machinery = = = With the exception of L\u00fcbeck , the ships ' propulsion system consisted of two triple-expansion engines , designed to give 9,863 indicated horsepower ( 7,355 kW ) for a top speed of 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . L\u00fcbeck was instead fitted with a pair of Parsons steam turbines , rated at 11,343 shaft horsepower ( 8,458 kW ) and a top speed of 22.5 knots ( 41.7 km / h ; 25.9 mph ) , though all seven ships exceeded these speeds on trials . All seven ships had ten coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers , which were trunked into three funnels amidships . The ships carried up to 860 tonnes ( 850 long tons ) of coal , which gave the first three ships a range of 4,270 nautical miles ( 7,910 km ; 4,910 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) ; L\u00fcbeck 's less efficient turbine engines cut her cruising radius to 3,800 nmi ( 7,000 km ; 4,400 mi ) , while the last three ships of the class had a longer range , at 4,690 nmi ( 8,690 km ; 5,400 mi ) . Bremen and Hamburg had three generators that produced a total output of 111 kilowatts at 110 volts ; the rest of the ships had two generators rated at 90 kilowatts at the same voltage . = = = Armament and armor = = = The ships of the class were armed with ten 10.5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were placed side by side aft . The guns could engage targets out to 12,200 m ( 40,000 ft ) . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . Later in their careers , Bremen and L\u00fcbeck had two 15 cm SK L / 45 guns installed in place of the two forward and two rear 10.5 cm guns . They retained the six broadside 10.5 cm guns . All seven ships were also equipped with two 45 cm ( 17.7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes . These tubes were submerged in the hull on the broadside . L\u00fcbeck later had a pair of 50 cm ( 20 in ) torpedo tubes installed in deck mounts , with four torpedoes . Armor protection for the members of the class consisted of two layers of steel with one layer of Krupp armor . The ships were protected by an armored deck that was up to 80 millimeters ( 3.1 in ) thick . Sloped armor 50 mm ( 2.0 in ) thick gave some measure of vertical protection , coupled with the coal bunkers . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3.9 in ) thick sides and a 20 mm ( 0.79 in ) thick roof . The ships ' guns were protected by 50 mm thick shields . = = Construction = = The seven ships of the Bremen class were built between 1902 and 1907 , at various German dockyards , including private firms and government shipyards . = = Service history = = The ships of the Bremen class served in a variety of roles throughout their careers . Bremen and Leipzig served abroad from 1905 to 1914 ; the former returned to Germany shortly before the outbreak of World War I , and the latter remained with the East Asia Squadron . Hamburg , Berlin , L\u00fcbeck , and Danzig served in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet after they entered service . M\u00fcnchen meanwhile was used as a torpedo test ship during her pre-war service . All seven of the ships saw action during the First World War , though only Bremen and Leipzig was lost during the conflict . Danzig was present during the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 , but did not directly engage the British ships . She did , however , rescue survivors from the sinking cruiser Ariadne . Hamburg was present for the raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914 , where she briefly encountered \u2014 but did not engage \u2014 British light forces . Only one ship , M\u00fcnchen , saw action at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916 , where she was hit by five medium-caliber shells and moderately damaged . Three of the ships , Bremen , L\u00fcbeck , and Danzig , saw action against Imperial Russian forces in the Baltic Sea during the war , including during the assault on Libau and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915 and during Operation Albion in 1917 . Bremen struck Russian mines in December 1915 and sank with the majority of her crew going down with her . Leipzig , still overseas at the start of the war , saw action at the Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands in late 1914 . At the former , she engaged the British cruiser HMS Glasgow , and at the latter , was sunk by Glasgow and HMS Cornwall . Berlin was withdrawn from service in 1916 and disarmed . M\u00fcnchen was badly damaged by a British mine in October 1916 , and thereafter decommissioned for use as a barracks ship . Hamburg was also used as barracks ship later in the war , and Leipzig became a training ship in 1917 . Danzig was the last ship to leave active service , in late 1917 . Of the five surviving ships , Berlin and Hamburg were retained by the newly reorganized Reichsmarine as training ships . The remaining three , L\u00fcbeck , M\u00fcnchen , and Danzig , were surrendered as war prizes to the United Kingdom , which sold them for scrapping in the early 1920s . Hamburg and Berlin soldiered on as training cruisers into the late 1920s and early 1930s ; by the mid-1930s , they had again been converted into floating barracks . Hamburg was sunk by British bombers in 1944 , and later raised and broken up for scrap in 1949 . Berlin survived World War II and was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak after the war to dispose of the munitions .",

                    "text": "SM UB-7 = SM UB-7 was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. She disappeared in the Black Sea in September 1916 . UB-7 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November . UB-7 was a little over 28 metres ( 92 ft ) in length and displaced between 127 and 141 tonnes ( 125 and 139 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun . UB-7 was originally one of a pair of UB I boats sent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy to replace an Austrian pair to be sent to the Dardanelles , and was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Pola in March 1915 for reassembly . She was launched in April and commissioned as SM UB-7 in the German Imperial Navy in May when the Austrians opted out of the agreement . Although briefly a part of the Pola Flotilla at commissioning , UB-7 spent the majority of her career patrolling the Black Sea as part of the Constantinople Flotilla . The U-boat sank one ship of 6,011 GRT in September 1915 . In October , she helped repel a Russian bombardment of Bulgaria . She was considered for transfer to the Bulgarian Navy , but disappeared in late September 1916 before a transfer could take place . Her fate is officially unknown , but sources report that may have struck a mine or been sunk by a Russian airplane . = = Design and construction = = After the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I , the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . Project 34 , a design effort begun in mid-August 1914 , produced the Type UB I design : a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled . Constrained by railroad size limitations , the UB I design called for a boat about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displacing about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two torpedo tubes . UB-7 was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines \u2014 numbered UB-1 to UB-8 \u2014 ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel , just shy of two months after planning for the class began . UB-7 was laid down by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 30 November . As built , UB-7 was 28.10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) long , 3.15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam , and had a draft of 3.03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . She had a single 59-brake-horsepower ( 44 kW ) Daimler 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel , and a single 119-shaft-horsepower ( 89 kW ) Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel , both attached to a single propeller shaft . Her top speeds were 6.47 knots ( 11.98 km / h ; 7.45 mph ) , surfaced , and 5.51 knots ( 10.20 km / h ; 6.34 mph ) , submerged . At more moderate speeds , she could sail up to 1,650 nautical miles ( 3,060 km ; 1,900 mi ) on the surface before refueling , and up to 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) submerged before recharging her batteries . Like all boats of the class , UB-7 was rated to a diving depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds . UB-7 was armed with two 45-centimeter ( 17.7 in ) torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes . She was also outfitted for a single 8-millimeter ( 0.31 in ) machine gun on deck . UB-7 's standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men . While UB-7 's construction neared completion in early March 1915 , Enver Pasha and other Turkish leaders were pleading with their German and Austro-Hungarian allies to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help attack the British and French fleet pounding Turkish positions . The Germans induced the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und K\u00f6nigliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) to send two boats \u2014 its own Germaniawerft-built boats U-3 and U-4 \u2014 with the promise of UB-7 and UB-8 as replacements . When work on UB-7 and UB-8 was complete at the Germaniwerft yard , they were both readied for rail shipment . The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars . The boats were ready for shipment to the main Austrian naval base at Pola on 15 March , despite the fact that the Austrian pair was still not ready . German engineers and technicians that accompanied the German boats to Pola worked under the supervision of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Hans Adam , head of the newly created U-boat special command ( German : Sonderkommando ) . Typically , the UB I assembly process took about two to three weeks , and , accordingly , UB-7 was launched at Pola sometime in April . = = Career = = During her trials , UB-7 developed a leak which took some time to repair . In the meantime , she was assigned the Austrian number of U-7 and an Austrian commander . Her German crew at Pola \u2014 since it was still the intent for UB-7 to be transferred to the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine \u2014 wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms . As time dragged on , the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready , and eventually Admiral Anton Haus , the head of the Austrian Navy , reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy . With the change of heart from the Austrians , Germany resolved to retain UB-7 and send her to the aid of the Turks . So , upon completion of her leak repairs , the boat was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-7 on 6 May under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wilhelm Werner , a 26-year-old native of Apola . At commissioning , the boat temporarily joined the Pola Flotilla ( German : Deutsche U-Halbflotille Pola ) . Because of her limited range , UB-7 would not have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey , so on the night on 15 / 16 May , she was towed by the Austrian destroyer SMS Triglav through the Straits of Otranto and into the Ionian Sea . By June , UB-7 had reached Smyrna \u2014 not having any success on her journey there \u2014 and joined U-21 and UB-8 in the Constantinople Flotilla ( German : U-boote der Mittelmeer division in Konstantinopel ) . Once there , UB-7 was ineffective because she was hampered by her limited torpedo supply and her weak engines , which made negotiating the strong Dardanelles currents nearly impossible . Because of this , UB-7 was sent to patrol in the Black Sea in July , cruising without success from the 5th to the 22nd . In September 1915 , UB-7 and UB-8 were sent to Varna , Bulgaria , and from there , to patrol off the Russian Black Sea coast . On 18 September , UB-7 torpedoed and sank the British steamer Patagonia about 10.5 nautical miles ( 19.4 km ; 12.1 mi ) from Odessa . The cargo ship , of 6,011 gross register tons ( GRT ) , was the only ship credited to UB-7 , and the only one sunk by any of the Constantinople Flotilla in the month . Because Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers , battleships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet , and aircraft from the seaplane carriers Almaz and Imperator Nikolai I began attacks on Varna and the Bulgarian coast on 25 October . UB-7 and UB-8 , both based out of Varna by this time , sortied to disrupt the bombardment . Off Varna on the 27th , UB-7 got in position to fire a torpedo at the Russian battleship Panteleimon ( most well-known under her former name of Potemkin ) . Although UB-7 's crew heard what they thought was the torpedo explode , it did not hit Panteleimon . Despite the lack of success , the attempt did cause the Russians to break off their attacks and withdraw . In early 1916 , UB-7 and UB-8 were still cruising in the Black Sea out of Varna . The Germans did not have good luck in the Black Sea , which was not a priority for them . The Bulgarians , who saw the value of the submarines in repelling Russian attacks , began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8 . Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there . The transfer of UB-8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916 , but for reasons unreported in sources , UB-7 remained under the German flag . In July 1916 , the Germans sent SMS Breslau to mine off Novorossisk . To attempt to neutralize any Russian response , UB-7 \u2014 under the command of Hans L\u00fctjohann , who had taken over for Werner when he returned to Germany to command the new U-55 \u2014 was stationed off Sevastopol to attack any ships that sailed in response to the mission . Unfortunately , Russian seaplanes spotted UB-7 and bombed the U-boat , preventing her from accomplishing her goal . With the submarine out of the way , Rear Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak sortied with dreadnought Imperatritsa Mariya , cruiser Kagul , and five destroyers . The Russian fleet engaged Breslau , which was forced to abort her mission and retire . Sources are quiet on damage , if any , suffered by UB-7 . = = Summary of raiding history = = = = Fate = = On 27 September 1916 , UB-7 departed Varna for operations off Sevastopol and was never heard from again . According to some sources , UB-7 was mined somewhere in the Black Sea . In June 1917 , a Russian pilot captured by the Germans reported that a Russian airplane bombed and sank UB-7 on 1 October at position 44 \u00b0 30 \u2032 N 33 \u00b0 15 \u2032 E , near the Chersones Lighthouse . Authors Dwight Messimer and Robert Grant are each dubious of this claim , and the fate of UB-7 is still officially unknown . Among the fifteen men lost on UB-7 were the Constantinople Flotilla 's senior radio officer , and the first Bulgarian submariner lost during the war , a trainee from Vidin .",

The U-boat had a total length of 76.50 m ( 251 ft ) , a pressure hull length of 58.75 m ( 192 ft 9 in ) , a beam of 6.51 m ( 21 ft 4 in ) , a height of 9.40 m ( 30 ft 10 in ) , and a draught of 4.70 m ( 15 ft 5 in ) . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40 / 46 supercharged four-stroke , nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of 4,400 metric horsepower ( 3,240 kW ; 4,340 shp ) for use while surfaced , two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345 / 34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 1,000 metric horsepower ( 740 kW ; 990 shp ) for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two 1.92 m ( 6 ft ) propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres ( 750 ft ) .

There , on 16 November , she attacked the 4,915 ton British merchant ship Arlington Court , a straggler from Convoy SL-7A , en route from Rosario , Argentina to Hull with a cargo of 7,340 tons of maize . The ship was hit by a single torpedo 320 nautical miles ( 590 km ; 370 mi ) west-south-west of Start Point in Devon . The crew abandoned ship , the U-boat fired another torpedo , which sank the ship within 30 minutes . Seven of the crew were lost , the survivors were picked up by Dutch and Norwegian freighters . After the attack , U-43 was hunted by convoy escorts for 20 hours , sustaining some damage from depth charges . Continuing with her patrol , U-43 attacked Convoy 14-BS in the Bay of Biscay , and sank the 4,374 ton French merchant ship Arijon on 22 November . Convoy escorts counter-attacked with 23 depth charges , but U-43 escaped without damage . Late on 25 November 1939 , about 120 nautical miles ( 220 km ; 140 mi ) west-north-west of Cape Finisterre ( northwest Spain ) , U-43 attacked the unescorted 2,483 ton British collier Uskmouth . Both G7a torpedoes malfunctioned ( a common problem in the early years of the war ) , so the U-boat opened fire with her deck gun . After a while she fired another torpedo , but missed , so recommenced shelling . After firing 149 rounds , U-43 left the ship on fire and slowly sinking . Two crewmen were killed , while 23 survivors were picked up by an Italian merchant ship . On the morning of 8 December U-43 was attacked by an unidentified aircraft and severely damaged . She returned to Wilhelmshaven six days later , on the 14th . = = = 2nd patrol = = = After the 6th U-boat Flotilla was disbanded in December 1939 , U-43 was assigned to the 2nd U-boat Flotilla based in Wilhelmshaven . U-43 departed from there on 13 March 1940 and sailed along the coast of Norway , north of Scotland , and into the waters west of Ireland , but had no success . The First Watch Officer ( second-in-command of the U-boat ) Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Wilhelm Behrens fell overboard and was lost on 31 March .

She returned to Wilhelmshaven the next day . = = = 4th patrol = = = U-43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 13 May 1940 and out into the Atlantic . Her first attack took place on 28 May , south-west of Land 's End , when she fired a torpedo at the British merchant ship Alca . She missed , and then opened fire with her deck gun . The armed ship returned fire , but neither vessel made any hits ; the U-boat broke off the attack . U-43 finally found success on 21 June when she attacked Convoy 65-X south-west of Figueira da Foz , Portugal , hitting the 8,627 ton British tanker Yarraville with a single torpedo . The ship caught fire and sank . Five crew members were killed , the 45 survivors were picked up by a French trawler . Late on 30 June U-43 hit the 13,376 ton British merchant ship SS Avelona Star with a single torpedo 220 nautical miles ( 410 km ; 250 mi ) northwest of Cape Finisterre . The ship , part of Convoy SL-36 , was en route from Buenos Aires to London with a cargo of 5,630 tons of frozen meat and 1,000 tons of oranges . The crew abandoned the ship , which foundered the next day . One crewman was killed in the attack , the 84 survivors were picked up by the British merchant ship Beignon , which was subsequently torpedoed and sunk by U-30 on 1 July . Three survivors from Avelona Star were killed . On the evening of 9 July U-43 sank the unescorted 3,944 ton British merchant ship Aylesbury about 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) southeast of Ireland . Hit by two torpedoes , the ship sank in 15 minutes . All 35 crew survived . U-43 's fourth and final success on her fourth patrol took place on the morning of 17 July when she sank the 3,509-ton British merchant ship Fellside , a straggler from convoy OA-184 , about 135 nautical miles ( 250 km ; 155 mi ) north-west of Bloody Foreland ( Cnoc Fola ) , Donegal . The U-boat 's first torpedo passed under the vessel , but the second struck the ship and caused her to sink within five minutes . Twelve of the crew were killed , 21 survivors were rescued . U-43 arrived back at Wilhelmshaven on 22 July after 71 days at sea . = = = 5th patrol = = = U-43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 9 September 1940 , stopping at Bergen , Norway for three days before sailing on the 15th for another Atlantic patrol . She sank only one ship , the 5,802 ton British merchantman Sulairia , separated from Convoy OB-217 , on 25 September . The U-boat hit the ship with a single torpedo causing her to sink 356 nautical miles ( 659 km ; 410 mi ) west of Achill Head , County Mayo . One man was lost , the remaining 56 crewmen were picked up by HMCS Ottawa . U-43 then made for her new home port at Lorient in France , where the 2nd U-boat Flotilla had relocated in June after the fall of that country , arriving there on 18 October . Her commander , Wilhelm Ambrosius , was promoted to Korvettenkapit\u00e4n on 1 November , and left U-43 , going on to take command of the 22nd U-boat Flotilla in January 1941 . Command of the U-boat passed to Oberleutnant zur See Wolfgang L\u00fcth , who would go on to become the second most successful German submarine commander of the war . = = = 6th patrol = = = Under her new captain , U-43 left Lorient on 10 November 1940 and returned to the waters west of Ireland , where she sank three more merchant ships and damaged a fourth . On the morning of 2 December she attacked Convoy OB-251 west-south-west of Rockall and sank two ships . Her first victim was the 7,113 ton British merchant ship Pacific President , which was hit by two torpedoes and quickly sank with the loss of her crew of 50 men . Forty-five minutes later U-43 hit the 12,247 ton British oil tanker Victor Ross with two torpedoes . A third torpedo was fired five minutes later , but missed , the U-boat evaded a ramming attempt by crash-diving shortly afterwards . However , she persisted and hit the ship with a fourth torpedo 20 minutes later , sinking her . There were no survivors from her 44 crew . In the evening of 6 December , U-43 spotted a ship and pursued her for three and a half hours before firing a single torpedo , which missed . The U-boat fired another torpedo 20 minutes later , hitting the unknown ship and sinking her in 63 seconds . The vessel is believed to be the 1,902 ton Norwegian merchant ship Skrim , which had lost contact with Convoy OB-252 two days before in heavy weather and was never seen again . Finally , on 13 December , U-43 fired two torpedoes at the unescorted 10,350 ton British merchant ship Orari about 450 nautical miles ( 830 km ; 520 mi ) southwest of Ireland . One torpedo hit the ship in the stern . However , U-43 had no torpedoes left , and the sea was too rough for her to use her deck gun . The crew of the ship managed to plug the hole with tarpaulins , and the ship made it under her own power to the Clyde . U-43 returned to Lorient on 17 December 1940 after a patrol of 38 days . On 4 February 1941 , while at Lorient docks , U-43 was sunk after a valve was accidentally left open , putting the U-boat out of action for the next three months . = = = 7th patrol = = = After this enforced absence U-43 began her next patrol on 11 May 1941 , still under the command of Wolfgang L\u00fcth , who had been promoted to Kapit\u00e4nleutnant on 1 January . Once again she sailed out into the mid-Atlantic , where she sank three ships . Early on the morning of 15 May U-43 opened fire with her deck gun and anti-aircraft guns on the 488 ton French three-masted sailing ship Notre Dame du Ch\u00e2telet , en route from St. Malo to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to fish . After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank . L\u00fcth suspected that the vessel was reporting the positions of U-boats to Allied forces , while the 10 survivors thought they had been attacked by a British submarine . They , from her crew of 38 , abandoned ship in two lifeboats . Two were picked up by the Italian submarine Otaria on 23 May . On the evening of 6 June U-43 put two torpedoes into the 4,802 ton Dutch merchant ship Yselhaven about 600 nautical miles ( 1,100 km ; 690 mi ) east of Newfoundland . The ship , separated from Convoy OB-328 , sank within two minutes . Only 10 of her crew of 34 survived to be rescued by the Finnish merchantman Hammarland on 15 June . In the early hours of 17 June , U-43 torpedoed and sank the 2,727 ton British merchant ship Cathrine , part of Convoy SL-76 , which was loaded with 3,700 tons of manganese ore , about 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ; 290 mi ) south-west of Cape Clear ( southern Ireland ) . Only three men survived from her crew of 27 ; they spent 33 days in a lifeboat before being found by a British trawler .

U-43 went to sea again on 10 November 1941 , this time she was more successful , sinking three ships near the Azores . Early on the morning of 29 November , U-43 fired two torpedoes at the 5,569 ton British merchant ship Thornliebank , part of Convoy OS-12 , and loaded with general cargo and munitions , about 240 nautical miles ( 440 km ; 280 mi ) north-north-west of the Azores . Both torpedoes struck the ship , which exploded violently . There were no survivors from the crew of 75 men . Despite being about 1,200 metres ( 0.75 mi ) distant , debris from the explosion struck the surfaced U-boat , slightly injuring a crewman ; the next day an unfuzed 10 cm ( 3.9 in ) shell was found lodged in the conning tower . On the evening of 30 November , the 4,868-ton British merchant ship Ashby , a straggler from Convoy OS-12 , was hit by one of two torpedoes fired by U-43 , 170 nautical miles ( 310 km ; 200 mi ) south-south-east of Flores in the Azores . The ship sank within four minutes with the loss of 17 of her crew of 50 . The survivors were picked up by the Portuguese destroyer Lima . After the attack the U-boat was depth charged for several hours by convoy escorts , but managed to escape unharmed . At about 17 : 00 on 1 December 1941 , U-43 and U-575 spotted the 7,542 ton unescorted and unarmed tanker Astral . Both U-boats gave chase , but after four hours U-575 , commanded by Kapit\u00e4nleutnant G\u00fcnther Heydemann , observed the large American flag painted on her side and abandoned the pursuit . U-43 continued to follow the neutral ship , firing a torpedo at her around midnight , which missed . The ship immediately began to sail a zigzag evasive course at full speed , but the U-boat had no problem following her in the light of the full moon . The next morning U-43 hit the Astral with two torpedoes . The ship , loaded with 78,200 barrels ( 12,430 m3 ) of gasoline and kerosene , exploded and sank within minutes . There were no survivors from her crew of 37 . The Astral was the third of four American merchant ships sunk by U-boats prior to America 's entry into the war . U-43 returned to Lorient on 16 December . = = = 10th patrol = = = L\u00fcth 's last patrol with the boat began on 30 December 1941 , when U-43 sailed from Lorient into the mid-Atlantic , where she sank three more ships . The first was the 5,246 ton Swedish cargo ship Yngaren , straggling from convoy HX-168 due to bad weather , about 600 nautical miles ( 1,100 km ; 690 mi ) west of Ireland . On the morning of 12 January 1942 the ship was hit by two torpedoes and sank within a minute . Six British passengers and 32 crewmen were lost , the only two survivors were spotted on a raft on 10 February by a British patrol aircraft , which directed a fishing trawler to their position the next day . Early in the morning of 14 January , U-43 attacked Convoy ON-55 south of Iceland and sank the 6,641 ton British merchant ship Empire Surf . Only six of the crew of 53 survived to be picked up by HMS Alisma . About two hours later U-43 attacked the convoy again and sank the 5,707 ton Panama-registered American merchant ship Chepo . There were 21 survivors from her 38 crew . The U-boat then sailed to Kiel , arriving on 22 January .

On the morning of 18 November , U-43 fired four torpedoes at Convoy SC-109 and hit the 9,131 ton American tanker Brilliant , loaded with 90,704 barrels ( 14,420.8 m3 ) of fuel oil . A 40-foot ( 12 m ) diameter hole was made in her side , and the cargo caught fire . While some of the crew abandoned ship , those remaining aboard managed to put the fires out ; making only three knots , the ship limped the 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ; 350 mi ) to Bonavista Bay , Newfoundland , arriving on 24 November . Brilliant eventually left Newfoundland on 18 January 1943 under tow , but after two days the ship broke in half . The fore section sank immediately , while the aft section drifted for some days before it was found and the 44 crew rescued . The aft section was taken in tow , but sank the next day .

Only later did U-43 learn that it was the 5,154 ton German blockade runner Doggerbank , formerly the British Speybank that had been captured by the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis in January 1941 . The ship was carrying 7,000 tons of rubber , fats , fish oil , and other raw materials from Yokohama to France ; she was several days ahead of her scheduled arrival date . U-43 returned to Lorient on 31 March after 82 days at sea . = = = 14th patrol = = = U-43 's final patrol began when she sailed from Lorient on 13 July 1943 and headed southwest into the Atlantic . On the evening of 19 July , in company with U-403 in the Bay of Biscay , the two U-boats were attacked by a British Liberator Mk.V bomber of No. 86 Squadron RAF . U-403 crash-dived immediately , covered by the AA fire of U-43 , which then dived . The Liberator was slightly damaged and a crewman wounded , but dropped two homing torpedoes .

The ship was named after Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass who commanded German forces in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 . Several days after the start of World War II , she unsuccessfully attacked , together with another destroyer , Polish ships anchored at the naval base on the Hel Peninsula . Leberecht Maass was lightly damaged during the action . In mid-February 1940 , while proceeding into the North Sea to search for British fishing trawlers , the ship was bombed by a patrolling German bomber that damaged her steering . She either drifted into a newly laid British minefield or was again hit by bombs and broke in half with the loss of the bulk of her crew . = = Design and description = = Leberecht Maass had an overall length of 119 meters ( 390 ft 5 in ) and was 114 meters ( 374 ft 0 in ) long at the waterline . The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters ( 37 ft 1 in ) , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters ( 13 ft 11 in ) . She displaced 2,223 long tons ( 2,259 t ) at standard load and 3,156 long tons ( 3,207 t ) at deep load . The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets , each driving one propeller shaft , were designed to produce 70,000 PS ( 51,000 kW ; 69,000 shp ) using steam provided by six high-pressure Wagner boilers . The ship had a designed speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) , but her maximum speed was 38.7 knots ( 71.7 km / h ; 44.5 mph ) . Leberecht Maass carried a maximum of 752 metric tons ( 740 long tons ) of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles ( 8,100 km ; 5,100 mi ) at a speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , but the ship proved top-heavy in service and 30 % of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship . The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi ( 2,830 km ; 1,760 mi ) at 19 knots . The ship carried five 12.7 cm SK C / 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields , two each superimposed , fore and aft . The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure . Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C / 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C / 30 guns in single mounts . The ship carried eight above-water 53.3-centimeter ( 21.0 in ) torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts . A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount . Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern . Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each . Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines . A system of passive hydrophones designated as ' GHG ' ( Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t ) was fitted to detect submarines . The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men , plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship . = = Service history = = Leberecht Maass was the first destroyer to be built in Germany since World War I. The ship was ordered on 7 July 1934 and laid down at Deutsche Werke , Kiel , on 10 October 1934 as yard number K232 . She was launched on 18 August 1935 and completed on 14 January 1937 . She became the flagship of the F\u00fchrer der Torpedoboote ( Chief of Torpedo Boats ) upon commissioning . Leberecht Maass spent most of her first year training and made a port visit to Gothenburg in April 1938 . Upon her return she was taken in hand by Deutsche Werke to have her bow rebuilt to reduce the amount of water that came over the bow in head seas . The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise . In December , Leberecht Maass , together with her sisters Z2 Georg Thiele , Z3 Max Schultz , and Z4 Richard Beitzen , sailed to the area of Iceland to evaluate her seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with her new bow . On 23 \u2013 24 March 1939 , the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland to occupy Memel . She participated in the Spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean , as the flagship of Rear Admiral G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens , and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May . On 3 September 1939 , Z1 Leberecht Maass and Z9 Wolfgang Zenker took part in an attack on the Polish ships Gryf and Wicher in Gdynia harbour . The Poles replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive maneuvers and to lay a smoke screen to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners . Leberecht Maass was hit in the superstructure by a 152-millimeter ( 6.0 in ) shell from the coast defense battery at Hel that killed four crewmen and wounded another four men . L\u00fctjens ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective . The following day , she sailed to Swinem\u00fcnde to have her damage repaired , a process that took until 10 September . After its completion , Leberecht Maass helped to lay defensive minefields in the North Sea . The ship began a scheduled refit in Swinem\u00fcnde on 29 September and Lutjens transferred his flag to Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp . She was attached to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla on 22 December . On 22 February 1940 , Leberecht Maass and five other destroyers , Z3 Max Schultz , Z4 Richard Beitzen , Z6 Theodor Riedel , Z13 Erich Koellner and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt , sailed for the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing vessels in \" Operation Wikinger \" . En route , the flotilla was erroneously attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from KG 26 . Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb , lost steering , and broke in half , sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew , among them the ship 's commanding officer , Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Fritz Bassenge . Only 60 men were saved . During the rescue effort , Z3 Max Schultz hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew . Hitler ordered a Court of Inquiry to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships that been sunk by bombs from the He 111 . The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti-shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea . Postwar evidence revealed that one or both ships struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid .",

His career record of 46 merchant ships plus the French submarine Doris sunk during 15 war patrols , with a total displacement of 230,781 gross register tons ( GRT ) , was second only to that of Korvettenkapit\u00e4n ( Lieutenant Commander ) Otto Kretschmer , whose 47 sinkings totaled 274.333 GRT . L\u00fcth joined the Reichsmarine in 1933 . After a period of training on surface vessels , he transferred to the U-boat service in 1936 . In December 1939 he received command of U-9 , which he took on six war-patrols . In June 1940 he took command of U-138 for two patrols . In October 1940 he transferred again , this time to the ocean-going submarine U-43 for five war-patrols . After two patrols on U-181 , the second being his longest of the war , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds . He was the first of two U-boat commanders to be so honored during World War II , the other recipient being Albrecht Brandi .

This surface attack was carried out while U-9 's bridge was filled with onlooking crew members . Other sinkings included the surfaced French submarine Doris on 9 May 1940 and seven merchant ships with a total of 16,669 gross register tons ( GRT ) . Two of L\u00fcth 's officers on U-9 would be awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . His chief engineer Oberleutnant zur See Karl-Heinz Wiebe was decorated in 1944 when he was chief engineer of U-178 .

L\u00fcth , because of his experience \u2014 like many other top commanders \u2014 was tasked with training future U-boat commanders . These trainees often came along on single war-patrols , which would be their last exercise before they received their own command . Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Erich W\u00fcrdemann was one such trainee and sailed onboard U-43 from April to July 1941 .

To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote ( BdU \u2014 U-boat command headquarters ) directive , a hatch had been left open , allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room . Two petty officers were found to be most at fault ; but L\u00fcth , as captain , was ultimately responsible . However , no record of punishment seems to have survived and L\u00fcth 's career does not appear to have been affected . = = = U-181 = = = On 9 May 1942 L\u00fcth was given command of a long-range Type IXD-2 U-boat , U-181 . He left on his first patrol in September 1942 , departing from Kiel for the Indian Ocean and waters off South Africa . In October he reached the sea lanes outside Cape Town and spent a month patrolling the area , sinking 12 ships for 58,381 GRT before returning to Bordeaux in France , in January 1943 . On 13 November 1942 he received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves . On 31 January 1943 , L\u00fcth other Kriegsmarine officers traveled to the Wolf 's Lair , Hitler 's headquarters in Rastenburg , present-day K\u0119trzyn in Poland , for the Oak Leaves presentation . Following the presentation , Hitler met with D\u00f6nitz and Vizeadmiral Theodor Krancke in private . In this meeting , Hitler appointed D\u00f6nitz as Oberbefehlshaber der Marine ( Commander-in-Chief ) of the Kriegsmarine following Raeder 's resignation on 30 January 1943 . On the return flight to Berlin , D\u00f6nitz informed L\u00fcth and the other officers present of this change in command . In March 1943 L\u00fcth set out for a second patrol off South Africa and in the Indian Ocean , in particular the waters around Mauritius . This patrol lasted 205 days ( 23 March 1943 \u2013 14 October 1943 ) making it the second longest of the war . ( The longest combat patrol of World War II was 225 days in length , this was achieved by Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat as commander of the U-196 . ) L\u00fcth sank 10 ships totaling 45,331 GRT on this patrol , which turned out to be his last . While at sea he was promoted to Korvettenkapit\u00e4n on 1 April 1943 , and on 15 April received news that he had been awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . U-181 rendezvoused with the supply ship Charlotte Schliemann east of Mauritius to refuel on 21 June . Also present were U-177 , under the command of Robert Gysae , U-178 ( Wilhelm Dommes ) , U-196 ( Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat ) , U-197 ( Robert Bartels ) and U-198 ( Werner Hartmann ) . The commanders exchanged experiences and discussed the problem of torpedo failures . On 9 August of the same year and while still on patrol , L\u00fcth was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds . On 15 July 1943 , L\u00fcth sunk the British collier Empire Lake and noted in his logbook . \" Five men have been left floating on a piece of wreckage . Due to the high sea and 180-mile distance from land they will probably not be saved . \" L\u00fcth nominated two crew members of U-181 for the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross after this patrol . The chief engineer Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Carl-August Landfermann and 2nd Watch Officer Johannes Limbach both received the Knight 's Cross for their achievements . = = Ashore = = After five years of operational U-boat service , including 15 war-patrols and over 600 days at sea , L\u00fcth took command of 22nd U-boat Flotilla stationed at Gotenhafen in January 1944 . This was a training unit for U-boat commanders . In July 1944 he took command of the 1st Department of the Marineschule M\u00fcrwik ( M\u00fcrwik Naval Academy ) in Flensburg . He was promoted to Fregattenkapit\u00e4n ( Commander ) on 1 August 1944 and became the commander of the entire Marineschule in September .

Returning drunk in the night of 13 / 14 May 1945 , L\u00fcth failed to respond to the sentry 's challenge and was shot in the head by 18-year-old seaman Mathias Gottlob , a German guard . The password of the day was \" Tannenberg . \" The officer in charge immediately informed Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz , whose adjutant , Fregattenkapit\u00e4n Walter L\u00fcdde-Neurath , who had accepted the call , initially thought that it was a bad joke . L\u00fcdde-Neurath then informed L\u00fcth 's brother , Joachim L\u00fcth , as the two siblings were staying together . It was he who informed L\u00fcth 's wife and their four children that L\u00fcth had died . D\u00f6nitz contacted the British city commander of Flensburg , Colonel Roberts , asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral , which Roberts approved . That funeral , ( the last such of the Third Reich ) , was held for L\u00fcth on 16 May 1945 with Adolf Hitler 's successor as Head of State , Reichspr\u00e4sident and Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz , delivering the eulogy . D\u00f6nitz ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting . Four officers under the command of a Navy Judge conducted the court martial . Mathias Gottlob stated that , in accordance with his orders , he had asked for the password three times without response from the person , whom he could not visually identify in the darkness . Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip . The chain of events was confirmed by Maschinenmaat Karl Franz , who was leading the watch at the time .

After her commissioning in 1890 , she served on the Cape of Good Hope Station and later with the Mediterranean Fleet . In 1914 , she was loaned to New Zealand for service with what would later become the Royal New Zealand Navy . During the early stages of the First World War she performed convoy escort duties and then carried out operations in the Mediterranean against the Turks . She later conducted patrols in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf . By 1917 , she was worn out and dispatched back to New Zealand where she served as a depot ship in Wellington Harbour for minesweepers . In 1921 she was transferred to the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland for service as a training ship . Decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1947 , her hulk was scuttled in 1949 . = = Design and description = = HMS Philomel was laid down on 9 May 1889 at HM Naval Dockyard in Devonport , Plymouth . Her name is derived from Philomela , in Greek mythology the daughter of Pandion I , King of Athens , and was the fifth ship to be so named . The ship had an overall length of 278 feet ( 84.7 m ) , a beam of 41 feet ( 12.5 m ) and a draught of 17 feet 6 inches ( 5.3 m ) . She displaced 2,575 long tons ( 2,616 t ) . Propulsion was through 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines , driving two shafts , which produced a total of 7,500 indicated horsepower ( 5,600 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . She was also rigged for sail and when installing the foremast , workmen noticed it was stamped \" Devonport Dockyard 1757 \" . Her main armament consisted of eight QF 4.7 inch ( 120 mm ) guns with a secondary armament of eight 3-pounders . As well as four machine guns , the ship also mounted two submerged 14-inch ( 360 mm ) torpedo tubes . Philomel was launched on 28 August 1890 , and completed the following March . After completing sea trials , she was commissioned in the Royal Navy on 10 November 1891 . Commanded by Captain Charles Campbell , she was assigned to the Cape of Good Hope Station although fitting work and working up trials meant that Philomel did not arrive in South Africa until June 1892 . = = Operational history = = For six years , Philomel served on station , intercepting slave traders along the coast of Africa . In 1896 , she participated in the Anglo-Zanzibar War , during which rebels murdered the Sultan of Zanzibar and seized his palace . Along with the three gunboats and HMS St George , she bombarded the palace fortress and the only ship of the Zanzibar Navy , the HHS Glasgow . This action lasted less than an hour and resulted in the routing of the rebels . The following year , Philomel was transferred to the West Africa Station and participated in the Benin Expedition . A refit was completed in 1898 after which Philomel returned to Cape of Good Hope Station . She served throughout the Second Boer War . Some of her complement of 220 men served in the field with the Naval Brigade . Two of her 4.7 inch guns were disembarked and used in the Battle of Colenso . After the war , she returned to Devonport and was paid off on 22 March 1902 . She was laid up in the Firth of Forth for several years before a refit was carried out in 1907 at Haulbowline Dock in Ireland . During her tow to Ireland she went adrift for a night in the North Sea when the rope to the towing vessel , the HMS Hampshire , broke . Philomel was recommissioned in February 1908 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Captain John Seagrave . She provided assistance in the wake of the earthquake at Messina in Sicily . The following year she served with the East Indies Station , running patrols from Aden in the Persian Gulf for two years . = = = Transfer to New Zealand = = = In 1913 the Admiralty agreed to lend Philomel to New Zealand as a seagoing training cruiser to form the nucleus of the newly established New Zealand Naval Forces , which was a new division of the Royal Navy . This was in response to the desire of the New Zealand Minister of Defence at the time , James Allen , who wanted to establish a local naval force which would co-operate with the fledgling Royal Australian Navy . Philomel was recommissioned in October 1913 in Singapore and later sailed for New Zealand to join HMAS Psyche and HMAS Pyramus , both Pelorus-class cruisers serving on the New Zealand Station . The Philomel was commissioned for New Zealand service on 15 July 1914 , under the command of Captain Percival Hall-Thompson . Although mainly crewed by Englishmen , she was the country 's first warship . = = = First World War = = = The Philomel was on a short shakedown voyage to Picton on 30 July 1914 , prior to taking on its first complement of New Zealand cadets , when it was recalled to Wellington Harbour in anticipation of the outbreak of war . Largely crewed by personnel from the Royal Navy , volunteers were brought on board to bring the ship up to full strength and after stocking up with supplies , she departed for Auckland to await further instructions . On 15 August 1914 she formed part of the ocean escort for the New Zealand forces which was dispatched to occupy German Samoa ( now Samoa ) . The escort would have been unlikely to offer much resistance to the German cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and SMS Gneisenau that were known to be in the area . Fortunately , the convoy did not encounter the German ships . Philomel then steamed for the Kingdom of Tonga to deliver news of the hostilities with Imperial Germany before returning to New Zealand . By now the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force , formed for service overseas , were ready to embark from Wellington on a convoy for the Middle East . Philomel escorted the convoy as far as Western Australia . Then , along with Pyramus , she sailed northeastwards for Singapore in search of the German cruiser SMS Emden , which was then carrying out raids in the Indian Ocean . The two ships , which would have been outgunned by the more modern Emden , had reached Christmas Island when they received news of the Emden 's sinking by HMAS Sydney . They arrived in Singapore on 12 November from where Philomel continued onto Port Said , escorting three French troopships . From late 1914 , Philomel , needing maintenance and an update of equipment , was berthed at Malta and underwent an overhaul . This was completed by late January 1915 and she then started operations in the Mediterranean against the Turks . On 8 February she landed an armed party in Southern Turkey where a large force of Turkish soldiers were encountered , resulting in three seamen being killed and three wounded . This action marked the first deaths in the war of New Zealanders serving with a New Zealand formation . Subsequently Philomel was deployed in the Red Sea and in the Persian Gulf for much of the remainder of the year . In December 1915 she sailed to Bombay for maintenance work but was back in the Persian Gulf in January 1916 , continuing her patrolling . By the end of the year , her engines were giving trouble and her stern glands were worn out . A lengthy and costly refit was required and rather than incur this cost for a ship which was nearly at the end of her operational life , the Admiralty decided to gift her to New Zealand and dispatched her home to be paid off . She duly arrived in Wellington Harbour in March 1917 . A large portion of her Royal Navy crew were returned to England to be assigned to other berths . Armament removed , Philomel was recommissioned as a depot ship in Wellington , supporting minesweeping operations until May 1919 . = = = Postwar service = = = In March 1921 , on the creation of the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy , Philomel was recommissioned as a training base . She steamed from her berth at Wellington to the dockyard at the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland . Moored alongside the training jetty , she was operated as a training facility for new recruits to the naval service , under the command of a series of officers from the Royal Navy including , for nearly six months in 1923 , Commander Augustus Agar VC . Training armament was installed and in 1925 , her boilers and engines were removed to create more accommodation space . Further accommodation , in the form of wooden cabins , was later constructed on her deck . In October 1941 , on the creation of the Royal New Zealand Navy , Philomel was recommissioned as the training base HMNZS Philomel . = = = Fate = = = Philomel was paid off and decommissioned on 17 January 1947 and her name transferred to the Devonport Naval Shore Establishment . On the day of her decommissioning , the New Zealand Naval Board sent a signal to Philomel which stated : \" ... their regret at the passing from the service of the first of His Majesty \u2019 s New Zealand Ships , a ship that has meant so much to all who served in her . She goes as many good ships have gone before her , but when HMNZS Philomel \u2019 s colours are hauled down at sunset this evening , the tradition which she has established during her long career will live on in the depot to which she has given her name . \" The hulk of the Philomel was sold to the Strongman Shipping Company , based in Coromandel . She was towed and deliberately ran aground in Coromandel harbour , near the wharf . After her fittings and parts were removed , she was towed out to sea and sunk near Cuvier Island on 6 August 1949 . Much of the teak timber and some fittings went into a newly built coaster named Coromel , an amalgamation of Coromandel and Philomel . Her crest is mounted to the gate of the Devonport Naval Base .",

                    "text": "Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant = The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War . Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872 , serving from March 4 , 1869 , to March 4 , 1877 . Grant was a Republican , and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions . The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era , and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873 , a severe national depression , that dominated Grant 's second term . Grant bolstered the Executive Branch 's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans . Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South . Grant 's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \" union , freedom and equality . \" Grant 's Reconstruction policy , however , was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South . Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote . Grant 's notable efforts as President included civil rights , civil service reform , and Indian policy . Grant 's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations . Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party , many of them founding fathers of the GOP , who denounced Grant for violating the party 's emphasis on fighting corruption . The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful , that slavery and secessionism were dead . Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume . The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872 , depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party . Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats , but was decisively defeated by Grant . Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers , Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet ; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics . His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds . Having struggled to be a self-made man , Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family , while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency . Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation . Two of his Cabinet secretaries ( War and Navy ) , his personal secretary , and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates . Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874 , until Grant appointed a reformer . Grant often defended the culprits , rather than the integrity of government service , while he attacked their accusers . Middle-class public opinion , a key element in the Republican Party base , turned hostile to Grant . Some scholars , however , maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration , and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system . Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments , and several of Grant 's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments . After a false start with weak selections , Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish , Benjamin Bristow , Alphonso Taft , and Amos T. Akerman . Fish , as Secretary of State , negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain . Bristow , as Secretary of Treasury , ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion . Taft , a brilliant jurist as Attorney General , successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876 . Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan . Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876 ; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 ; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction . Economically , Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money , gold-based , anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold . He reduced governmental spending , decreased the federal work force , and reduced the national debt , while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department . During his second term in office , the Panic of 1873 , caused by rampant railroad speculation , shook the nation 's financial institutions ; banks failed , prices fell , and unemployment surged . Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes , personal greed , and national corruption . President Grant 's contraction of money supply worsened the panic ; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country . The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption . Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections . With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans . Grant implemented an innovative peace policy , though not always successful , with Native Americans . Hostilities took place with the Modoc War , the Red River War , and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed . In 1874 , millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers . Grant , who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle , rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison . After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873 , Grant 's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan . Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement . Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . However , Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America 's first national park , Yellowstone , and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation . The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant 's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875 . Grant 's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states . However , since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians . = = Presidency 1869 \u2013 1877 = = Grant 's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption . An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office . In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights . He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies , signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan . In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington , settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration . Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie , but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873 \u2013 1877 . Grant , wary of powerful congressional leaders , was the first President to ask for a line item veto . In the century after he left office most historians denounced the Reconstruction policies followed by Grant . More recently , Grant 's support for and enforcement of African Americans civil rights has earned him praise from scholars . While graft and corruption existed in the Southern state governments he supported with the Army , many civil rights advances were made for African Americans . He was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights ; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . The depression of 1873 , along with the increasingly unpopular Reconstruction program , weakened his reputation and his party , allowing the resurgent Democrats to gain a majority in the House of Representatives in 1875 . His Presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates . Nepotism , practiced by Grant , was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment . Grant and Sumner were often at odds with each other on matters of foreign policy and political patronage . Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant 's practice of nepotism in making political appointments . One historian , Mary L. Hinsdale , described the Grant Administration as \" a most extraordinary array of departures from the normal course \" and a \" military \" rule , in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group . In an unsuccessful effort to annex the island country of Santo Domingo , Grant bypassed the State Department by sending his military associate Orville E. Babcock to produce the treaty . Grant disregarded the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar over the McGarrahan mining claim patents . Grant 's foreign policy was heavily influenced by the able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish . Grant depended on Fish 's advice on domestic issues such as money policy and Reconstruction . His Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , was given full charge of national economic policies . In 1874 , Grant began a series of appointments that included reformers and qualified statesmen to his Administration , starting with Benjamin Bristow who prosecuted the Whiskey Ring . With the departure of Orville E. Babcock and William W. Belknap from the White House in 1876 , the Grant Administration took on a civilian rather than \" military \" style . = = Election of 1868 = = There were two main divisive issues in 1868 . The first was the continued Reconstruction of the South . The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices , and the Republicans endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote . The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks . The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $ 100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold . The greenbacks were known as \" cheap money \" and would be inflationary . The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold , a position attractive to investors and bankers . Finding a popular hero who endorsed their Reconstruction policies , the Republicans nominated Grant and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax . The Democrats , ignoring politically damaged President Andrew Johnson ( who was a political independent ) , nominated Horatio Seymour \u2013 former governor of New York \u2013 and Francis P. Blair from Missouri . Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads . The campaigning was nasty , as the Republicans waved the \" bloody shirt \" of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads . Grant himself never campaigned , except for his slogan \" Let us have peace \" and his apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering . Grant won with 52.7 % of the popular vote and won by a landslide in the Electoral College with 214 votes to Seymour 's 80 votes . Grant was helped by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Radical Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting . = = First Term 1869 \u2013 1873 = = = = = Cabinet = = = Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices , declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation . Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony . Out of personal loyalty , Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War . Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health ; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France . Grant then appointed Hamilton Fish , a conservative New York statesman , as Secretary of State . Fish would be Grant 's most successful appointment . His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men 's wives . Rawlins later died of tuberculosis and was replaced by William W. Belknap . Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet , including Adolph E. Borie and A.T. Stewart , with limited success . Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy , replaced by George M. Robeson , while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator Charles Sumner 's and Senator Roscoe Conkling 's opposition to amend the law . In place of Stewart , Grant appointed George S. Boutwell , known for his integrity , as Secretary of Treasury . Grant 's other cabinet appointments \u2014 Jacob D. Cox ( Interior ) , John Creswell ( Postmaster General ) , and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar ( Attorney General ) \u2014 were well-received and uncontroversial . Some of Grant 's cabinet members did not even know their names were offered to the Senate for confirmation . Grant 's independent , at times problematic , manner in choosing his cabinet started a rift between Republican party veterans who were denied consultation . = = = Modified Tenure of Office Act = = = In March 1869 , President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed , stating it was a \" stride toward a revolution in our free system \" . The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867 , sponsored by Radical Republicans , to curb the power of the President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments . The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868 . On March 5 , 1869 , a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act , but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed , unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments . Grant , to bolster the repeal effort , declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies , until the law was overturned , thus , agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law . Under national pressure for governmental reform , a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet , however , government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period . Grant , who did not desire a party split over the matter , signed the bill ; afterwards , he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law . The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887 . Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts , a practice known as nepotism . = = = Political defections = = = Initially , President Grant was popular among many political and newspaper elite . Political defections began as early as the spring and fall of 1869 when both Charles A. Dana and Henry Adams became critical and discouraged over Grant 's Presidency in the aftermath of the Black Friday scandal . By 1870 , Horace Greeley lost enthusiasm for the Administration with the resignations of Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Ambassador to Britain John L. Motley . Prominent journalists Samuel Bowles , Horace White , E. L. Godkin , and William C. Bryant became concerned over alleged incompetence and lack of national direction from Grant . Personal animosity remained between Charles Sumner and Grant over the Senate rejection of the Santo Domingo Treaty . The common citizen , however , revered Grant for his gallant service in the Civil War . = = = Reconstruction and civil rights = = = During Reconstruction , Freedmen ( freed slaves ) , were given the vote by Congress and became active in state politics ; fourteen were elected to Congress . In state government they were never governor but did become lieutenant governors or secretaries of state . They formed the voting base of the Republican party along with some local whites ( called \" Scalawags \" ) and new arrivals from the North ( called \" Carpetbaggers \" . ) Most Southern whites opposed the Republicans ; they called themselves \" Conservatives \" or \" Redeemers \" . Grant repeatedly took a role in state affairs ; for example on December 24 , 1869 , he established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature . Most historians in the 21st century consider Reconstruction to be a failure . However , historian Mark Summers in 2014 has argued that : if we see Reconstruction 's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled , of a Union held together forever , of a North and South able to work together , of slavery extirpated , and sectional rivalries confined , of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty , backed by armed force , then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was , a lasting and unappreciated success . = = = = Fifteenth amendment = = = = According to biographer , William S. McFeely , Grant and many in the north believed the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen . Grant used political pressure to ensure the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment , guaranteeing that \" no citizen can be denied the right to vote based upon race , color , or previous condition of servitude \" . When it passed he hailed it as \" a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day \" . Many in the south , however , were determined that the African American males ' right to vote would be unenforceable . = = = = Department of Justice = = = = On June 22 , 1872 , Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General , the Office of Solicitor General . Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America 's first Solicitor General . Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s . In the first few years of Grant 's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice . By 1871 , there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany , New York . The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South . Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \" better \" or \" stronger \" then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists . Akerman 's successor , George H. Williams , in December 1871 , continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant 's second term in office . William 's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part that the Justice Department , having been inundated by Klan outrage cases , did not have the effective man power to continue the prosecutions . = = = = Naturalization Act of 1870 = = = = On July 14 , 1870 Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States . This revised an earlier law , the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens . The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names , misrepresentations , or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship . = = = = Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 = = = = To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment , Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans ; Grant signed the bill , known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31 , 1870 . This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans . This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation , bribery , or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction . On January 13 , 1871 President Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South . On March 20 , President Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \" secure life , liberty , and property , and the enforcement of law , in all parts of the United States . \" President Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy . Congress investigated the Klan 's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan . This Act , also known as the \" Ku Klux Klan Act \" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler , was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan . Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship , Grant signed the bill into law on April 20 , 1871 after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury , George Boutwell , that federal protection was warranted , having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen . This law allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus on \" armed combinations \" and conspiracies by the Klan . The Act also empowered the president \" to arrest and break up disguised night marauders \" . The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States . The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction ; there was no organization above the local level . Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans . The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870 ; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott , who was mired in corruption charges , allowed the Klan to rise to power . Grant , who was fed up with their violent tactics , ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12 , 1871 . There was no response , and so on October 17 , 1871 , Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina . Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan ; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att . Gen. Akerman and Sol . Gen. Bristow . With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge , including the White League and the Red Shirts . = = = = Amnesty Act of 1872 = = = = Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30 , 1870 , Mississippi was readmitted February 23 , 1870 , and Virginia on January 26 , 1870 . Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15 , 1870 . All members for the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded . Technically , the United States was again a united country . To ease tensions , Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23 , 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates . This act allowed most former Confederates , who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States , to hold elected public office . Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office . = = = Indian affairs and human rights = = = = = = = \" Peace Policy \" for Indians = = = = Grant 's 1868 campaign slogan , \" Let us have peace , \" defined his policy toward reconstructing the South and opening a new era in relations with the western Indian tribes . In a major address , Grant stated : The building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not get on together , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom , and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life , and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations ... and giving them absolute protection there . The goal of his \" peace policy \" was to minimize military conflict with the Indians , looking forward to \" any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship \" . Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations . Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations ; the Army 's job was to force them back . The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society ; any Indian could leave the reservation at any time and join the larger society , and have full citizenship . The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924 . Grant 's Peace Policy was a sharp reversal of federal policy toward Native Americans . \" Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked . \" , he told Congress in his second Inaugural Address of 1873 . The president lobbied , though not always successfully , to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers . The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans , settlers , and the U.S. military . Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations . Statistical data of the number of Indian wars per year between 1850 and 1890 , revealed that battles decreased during Grant 's two terms in office from 101 in 1869 to 43 in 1877 . In 1875 there were only 15 battles , the lowest rate since 1853 at 13 battles . In 1869 , Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker , a Seneca Indian , as the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs . During Parker 's first year in office , the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58 . Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant , after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner . Red Cloud , along with chief of the Brul\u00e9 Sioux Spotted Tail , came to Washington , D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870 . Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity . When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7 , 1870 , they were given a bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869 . At their second meeting on May 8 , Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing . Out of concern for Native Americans , Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \" keep intruders off by military force if necessary \" . To prevent Native American hostilities and wars , Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870 \u2013 1871 . This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations . Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statues . Historians have debated issues of \" paternalism \" and \" colonialism \" but have glossed over the significance of contingencies , inconsistencies , and political competition involved in forging a substantive federal policy , according to scholar David Sim ( 2008 ) . He examined the peace policy , emphasizing incoherence in its formulation and implementation . . While the Grant administration focused on well-meaning but limited goals of placing \" good men \" in positions of influence and convincing native peoples of their fundamental dependency on the US government , attempts to create a new departure in federal-native relations were characterized by conflict and disagreement . According to Sim , The muddled creation of what has become known as the peace policy thus tells much about the varied and divergent attitudes Americans had toward the consolidation of their empire in the West following the Civil War . The innovation in Grant 's Native American peace policy was in appointing Quakers as US Indian agents to various posts throughout the nation . This destroyed the power of patronage , as Congress would be reluctant to go after church appointments . On April 10 , 1869 , Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners . Grant appointed volunteer members who were \" eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy \" ; a previous commission had been set up under the Andrew Johnson Administration in 1868 . The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \" civilize \" Native Americans . After the Piegan Massacre on January 23 , 1870 , when Major Edward M. Baker killed 173 tribal members , mostly women and children , Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \" up among the religious churches \" ; by 1872 , 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations . Quakers or Protestant clergy predominantly controlled most of the central and southern Plains Indian territories , while all other surrounding territories were under the control of appointed military officers . = = = = = Evaluations = = = = = Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy . Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary . The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant 's Peace Policy . The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies . The historian Robert M. Utley ( 1984 ) contended that Grant , as a pragmatist , saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers . He added that Grant 's \" Quaker Policy \" , despite having good intentions , failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \" the motivations , purposes , and ways of thinking \" between both White and Native American cultures . These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873 . In 1871 , President Grant 's Indian peace policy , enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona , required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education . The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers . In one raid , believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors , settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan , Arizona . The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant . 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville . Angered over the murders , the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians , 42 Mexicans , and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache . When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30 , they murdered 144 Apaches , mostly women and children , in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre . Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery . In May , an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise ; during the chase they killed 13 Apache . Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona . Most detrimental to Grant 's Peace Policy was rampant corruption in the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano . During Sec . Delano 's tenor , federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks , often allied with traders . In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano 's delinquency , Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter . Although Sec . Delano supported and defined Grant 's Indian peace policy and was instrumental in the creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872 , he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior . The previous Grant appointment , Secretary Jacob D. Cox , had run the department with efficiency and merit . Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation 's history . When Cox resigned in 1870 , Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses . After Sec . Delano finally resigned in 1875 , his replacement , Sec . Zachariah Chandler , reformed the Department of the Interior , banned \" Indian Attornies \" , and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs . Grant 's Secretary of War , William W. Belknap , who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War , received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership . Sec . Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft . Belknap was impeached by the House ; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted . = = = = West Point hazing reduced = = = = While President Grant advocated that African Americans enter the West Point Academy , he initially failed in 1870 and 1871 to protect the first African American West Point Academy cadet , James Albert Smith , from racist hazing by other cadets . This lack of protection was influenced by Grant 's son , then West Point cadet Frederick Dent Grant , who participated in the hazing against Smith . Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger , however , was appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871 , reformed the Academy ; having reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the \" discreditable \" practice . In 1871 , other African Americans eventually followed Smith 's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper , who was admitted to the Academy in 1873 , became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877 . In 1874 , Smith was forced out of the Academy due to having failed an unconventional private test , in defiance of traditional West Point practice , administrated by Prof. Peter S. Michie . Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997 , one hundred and twenty three years later . = = = = Utah territory polygamy = = = = In 1862 , during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories . Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah for the most part resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor . During the 1868 election , Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy . Tensions began as early as 1870 , when Mormons in Ogden , Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling . By the Fourth of July , 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City , Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops , however , leveler heads prevailed and violence was averted . President Grant , however , who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act . In October , 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals , put in a prison camp , arrested , and put on trial for polygamy . One convicted polygamist received a $ 500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor . On November 20 , 1871 Mormon leader Brigham Young , in ill health , had been charged with polygamy . Young 's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court . Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill . The Morrill Act , however , proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction . On December 4 , 1871 President Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \" a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . \" = = = = Comstock Act = = = = In March 1873 , anti-obscenity moralists , led by the YMCA 's Anthony Comstock , easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \" for any indecent or immoral use \" . Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it . Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell . Comstock prosecuted pornographers , imprisoned abortionists , banned nude art , stopped the mailing of information about contraception , and tried to ban what he considered bad books . = = = Early suffrage movement = = = During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued . The Republicans , who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election , added to their platform open discussion of women 's rights without actually endorsing women 's rights . = = = Economy and Treasury reform = = = On taking office Grant 's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit , which the Republican Congress had just passed . It ensured that all public debts , particularly war bonds , would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks . The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $ 130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862 . On May 19 , 1869 , Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government . In 1868 , a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours ; however , much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced . To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \" no reduction shall be made in the wages \" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers . Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees , started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters , and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue . These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus . By May 1869 , Boutwell reduced the national debt by $ 12 million . By September the national debt was reduced by $ 50 million , which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency . The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration 's debt policy . The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $ 292 million in 1871 \u2013 down from $ 322 million in 1869 . The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11 % in 1871 . Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1 , 1869 to 3,804 on December 1 , 1871 . He had increased tax revenues by $ 108 million from 1869 to 1872 . During his first administration the national debt fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.2 billion . In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration , Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . In 1870 , Pleasonton , a Grant appointment , approved an unauthorized $ 60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm . Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office . Refusing to resign on Boutwell 's request , Pleasonton protested openly before Congress . President Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out . = = = Yellowstone , buffalo , and conservation = = = Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook \u2013 Folsom \u2013 Peterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn \u2013 Langford \u2013 Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation \u2019 s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn-Langford-Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) . In 1872 , around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Wichita , Kansas , and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands . Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo . Native Americans protested at the \" wanton destruction \" of their food supply . By 1874 , 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States . Concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted , and a bill in Congress was passed , HR 921 , that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites . Taking advice from Secretary Delano , Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill , believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo . Ranchers favored the buffalo slaughter to open pasture land for their cattle herds . With the buffalo food supply lowered , Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations . The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game , including buffalo , from \" wanton destruction \" within the confines of the park . However , Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching ; as a result , Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment . By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred , a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park . As the Indian wars ended , Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894 , signed into law by President Grover Cleveland , that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone . Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska \u2019 s Pribilof Islands . This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land . = = = Foreign policies = = = The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful , except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo . The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant 's \" not unrealistic \" effort to relieve the plight of blacks in the South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil . The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully , and to the monetary advantage of the United States . Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled . The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish , who was a spokesman for caution and stability . A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretraries of States in United States history . Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17 , 1869 and served on Grant 's Cabinet until the end of Grant 's second term on March 4 , 1877 . Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12 , 1877 . = = = = Dominican Republic annexation treaty = = = = In 1869 , Grant proposed to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic , then known as Santo Domingo . Previously in 1868 , President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo , but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection of the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic . In July , 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman\u00e1 Bay for $ 2 million . To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power , Grant ordered naval ships , unauthorized by Congress , to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection . B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19 , 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization . Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $ 1.5 million to the Dominican national debt , the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state , the United States ' acquisition of the rights for Saman\u00e1 Bay for 50 years with an annual $ 150,000 rental , and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention . On January 10 , 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification . Despite his support of the annexation , Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm . Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of use to the Navy tactically , particularly Saman\u00e1 Bay , but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip . By providing a safe haven for the freedmen , he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights . Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit . He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would urge Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Brazil to abandon slavery . On March 15 , 1870 , the Foreign Relations Committee , headed by Sen. Charles Sumner , recommended against treaty passage . Sumner , the leading spokesman for African American civil rights , believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war , and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies , thereby blocking black political progress . On May 31 , 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty . Strongly opposed to ratification , Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate . On June 30 , 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate ; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against . Grant 's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt , and Bancroft Davis , assistant to Sec . Hamilton Fish , was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations . Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate , mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December , 1870 State of the Union Address . Grant was able to get Congress in January , 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island . Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation . Grant appointed Frederick Douglass , an African American civil rights activist , as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic . Returning to the United States after several months , the Commission in April 1871 , issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States . To celebrate the Commissions return , Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House , except Frederick Douglass . African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley . Douglas , however , who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House , remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party . Although the Commission supported Grant 's annexation attempt , there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty . Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner , Grant immediately removed Sumner 's close and respected friend Ambassador , John Lothrop Motley . With Grant 's prodding in the Senate , Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee . Grant reshaped his coalition , known as \" New Radicals \" , working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts , Roscoe Conkling of New York , and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , giving in to Fish 's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected , and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans . This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872 , when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans . A Congressional investigation in June , 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman\u00e1 that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified . U.S. Navy ships , with President Grant 's authorization , had been sent to protect B\u00e1ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel , Gregorio Luper\u00f3n , while the treaty negotiations were taking place . The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government . B\u00e1ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B\u00e1ez government . Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment . The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch 's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls . The Hatch incident , however , kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty . = = = = Cuban insurrection = = = = In 1869 , Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition . Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating . Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation . Fish , diligently and against popular pressure , was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims . The Sickle 's peace negotiations failed in Madrid , but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion . Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress , written by Fish and signed by Grant . The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt , calming national fears . = = = = Treaty of Washington = = = = Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes . Grant 's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty . Previously , Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships , CSS Florida , CSS Alabama , and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain . These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims . These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages , perhaps including turning over Canada . In April 1869 , the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war . Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress ; publicly denounced Queen Victoria ; demanded a huge reparation ; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment . The speech angered the British government , and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down . Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish . A joint high commission was created on February 9 , 1871 in Washington , consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States . The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts ; the British admitted regret , not fault , over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers . Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8 , 1871 ; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24 , 1871 . The Tribunal met in Geneva , Switzerland . The U.S. was represented by Charles Francis Adams , one of five international arbitrators , and was counseled by William M. Evarts , Caleb Cushing , and Morrison R. Waite . On August 25 , 1872 , the Tribunal awarded United States $ 15.5 million in gold ; $ 1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain . Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \" bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy \" . In addition to the $ 15.5 million arbitration award , the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights . On October 21 , 1872 William I , Emperor of Germany , settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States . = = = = Korean incident = = = = A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets , including Japan and China . Korea had excluded all foreign trade and , the U.S. sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was killed . The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force . On May 30 , 1871 Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships , part of the Asiatic Squadron , arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul . The fleet included the Colorado , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns , 47 officers , and a 571-man crew . While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate , Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes . The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort , but there was little damage . Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks , but the Royal Court kept silent . After ten days passed , on June 10 , Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts . These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa . Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed . Korea still refused to negotiate , and the American fleet sailed away . The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo . President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December , 1871 . After a change in regimes in Seoul , in 1881 , the U.S. negotiated a treaty \u2013 the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation . = = Corruption and reform ( 1869-1873 ) = = The main scandals included Black Friday in 1869 and the Whiskey Ring in 1875 . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier is not a Grant scandal ; its origins having been in 1864 during the Abraham Lincoln Administration which carried over into the Andrew Johnson Administration . The actual Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal was exposed during the Grant Administration in 1872 as the result of political infighting between Congressman Oakes Ames and Congressman Henry S. McComb . Stocks owned by Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck in the fraudulent Emma Silver Mine is considered a Grant Administration embarrassment rather than a scandal . Although Grant 's Administration had many successes during the first term as President in the economy , civil rights , and foreign policy , scandals associated with the Administration were beginning to emerge publicly . Although Grant himself was not directly responsible for and did not profit from the corruption among subordinates , he was reluctant to believe friends could commit criminal activities . As a result , he failed to take any direct action and rarely reacted strongly after their guilt was established . Grant protected close friends with Presidential power and pardoned persons who were convicted in the Whiskey Ring scandal after serving only a few months in prison . When his second term ended , Grant wrote to Congress that \" Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent \" . Nepotism was rampant ; around 40 family relatives financially prospered while Grant was President . = = = Gold Ring thwarted = = = In September 1869 , financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price . The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold , thus driving its price . President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $ 4 million in gold on ( Black ) Friday , September 23 . Gould and Fisk were thwarted , and the price of gold dropped . The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous . Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped , devastating farmers for years . = = = Civil service commission = = = Grant was the first U.S. President to recommend a professional civil service , pushed the initial legislation through Congress , and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission . The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees . Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872 ; having lasted for two years until December , 1874 . At the New York Custom House , a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue , persons who applied for an entry position had to take and pass a civil service examination . Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions . However , Congress , in no mood to reform itself , denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent . Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage , meaning appointments made without a merit system , should be labelled corruption . The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives : to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy , and to check the power of President Johnson . Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress , he refused , saying : \" Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress . If members will give up claiming patronage , that will be a step gained . But there is an immense amount of human nature in the members of Congress , and it is human nature to seek power and use it to help friends . You cannot call it corruption \u2013 it is a condition of our representative form of Government . \" Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends . He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies , even if they were guilty . Grant believed in loyalty with his friends , as one writer called it the \" Chivalry of Friendship \" . = = = Star Route Postal Ring = = = In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster-General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report . A $ 40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation . In 1876 , another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years . = = = New York Custom House Ring = = = Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy . Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees . Grant 's friend , George K. Leet , was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits . Grant 's third collector appointment , Chester A. Arthur , implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell 's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage . = = = Salary grab = = = On March 3 , 1873 , President Grant signed a law that authorized the President 's salary to be increased from $ 25,000 a year to $ 50,000 a year and Congressmen 's salaries to be increased by $ 2,500 . Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service . This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill . Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874 . Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government . Congress sustained Grant 's $ 50,000 a year salary . = = Election of 1872 = = Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the scandals evident during his first term in office . Grant had supported a patronage system that allowed Republicans to infiltrate and control state governments . In response to President Grant 's federal patronage , in 1870 , Senator Carl Schurz from Missouri , a German immigrant and Civil War hero , started a second party known as the Liberal Republicans ; they advocated civil service reform , a low tariff , and amnesty to former Confederate soldiers . The Liberal Republicans successfully ran B.G. Brown for the governorship of Missouri and won with Democrat support . Then in 1872 , the party completely split from the Republican party and nominated New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley as candidate for the Presidency . The Democrats , who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own , reluctantly adopted Greeley as their candidate with Governor B.G. Brown as his running mate . Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan . The Republicans , who were content with their Reconstruction program for the South , renominated Grant and Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson in 1872 . Wilson , a practical reformer , was intended to bulster the ticket , and potentially mend the political rift that grew between Grant and Sumner . Grant had remained a popular Civil War hero , and the Republicans continued to wave the \" bloody shirt \" as a patriotic symbol representing the North . The Republicans favored high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states . Grant also favored amnesty to former Confederate soldiers like the Liberal Republicans . Because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats , the physically ailing Greeley was no match for the \" Hero of Appomattox \" and lost dismally in the popular vote . Grant swept 286 Electoral College votes while other minor candidates received only 63 votes . Grant won 55.8 percent of the popular vote between Greeley and the other minor candidates . Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign , Greeley died a few weeks after the election and was able to receive only 3 electoral votes . Out of respect for Greeley , Grant attended his funeral . = = Second Term 1873 \u2013 1877 = = = = = Reconstruction = = = Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections . With the destruction of the Klan in 1872 , new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South . In Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan . Their goals were to oust the Republicans , return Conservative whites to power , and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them . Being loyal to his veterans , Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection . = = = = Colfax Massacre = = = = After the November 4 , 1872 election , Louisiana was a split state . In a controversial election , two candidates were claiming victory as governor . Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans . The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor , while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg . Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13 , 1873 . A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated . The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office . Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg . On March 4 , Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg 's state militia defeated McEnry 's fusionist party 's insurrection . A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish . Kellogg 's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops . Then on April 13 , White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured . A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg . On April 21 , Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order . On May 22 , Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana . On May 31 , McEnry finally told his followers to obey \" peremptory orders \" of the President . The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana , except , ironically , Grant Parish . = = = = The Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas = = = = In the fall of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor , Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks . Massive fraud characterized the election , but Baxter was declared the winner and took office . Brooks never gave up , and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in . Both sides mobilized militia units , and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets . There was anticipation who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks . Grant delayed , requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor , but Baxter refused to participate . Then , on May 15 , 1874 , President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas , and the hostilities ceased . In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter , and all the Republicans and the Redeemers came to power . A few months later in early 1875 , Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872 . Grant did not send in troops , and Brooks never regained office ; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock . Brooks died in 1877 . The episode brought further discredit to Grant . = = = = Vicksburg riots = = = = In August 1874 , the Vicksburg city government elected a White reform party consisting of Republicans and Democrats . This was done initially to lower city spending and taxes . Despite their early intentions , the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government , which had a majority of African Americans . Rather than using legal means , the White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby , the black county sheriff and tax collector . Crosby then went to Governor Adelbert Ames to seek help to regain his position as sheriff . Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position as Sheriff of Warren County . At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443 , over half of whom were African American . On December 7 , 1874 , Crosby and an African American militia approached the city . He had declared that the Whites were , \" ruffians , barbarians , and political banditti \" . A series of battles occurred that resulted in 29 African Americans and 2 Whites killed . The White militia retained control of the Court House and jail . On December 21 , Grant gave a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting . Philip Sheridan in Louisiana dispatched troops who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace . When questioned about the matter , Governor Ames denied he had told Crosby to use African American militia . On June 7 , 1875 , Crosby was shot to death by a White deputy while drinking in a bar . The origins for the shooting remained a mystery . = = = = Louisiana revolt and coups = = = = On September 14 , 1874 , the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans , and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee . Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet , with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police , made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops . Consisting of former Confederate soldiers , the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet 's army . On September 17 , Grant sent in Federal troops , and they restored the government back to Kellogg . During the following controversial election in November , passions rose high , and violence mixed with fraud were rampant ; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control . The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature . Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state . Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4 , 1875 legislature opening meeting . At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands . Initially , the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R\u00e9gis de Trobriand , and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building . However , Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans . Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building . The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army . Sheridan , who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9 : 00 P.M. , claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier . = = = = South Carolina 1876 = = = = During the election year of 1876 , South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain . Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation . The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term . Hampton supporters , donning red shirts , disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling . Tensions became violent on July 8 , 1876 when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg . The rifle clubs , wearing their Red Shirts , were better armed then the blacks . South Carolina was ruled more by \" mobocracy and bloodshed \" than by Chamberlain 's government . Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6 , 1876 in what was known as the \" King Street riot \" . The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops . Then , on September 19 , the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton . During the massacre , state representative Simon Coker was killed . On October 7 , Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \" rifle club \" members to put down their weapons . In the meantime , Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina . Out of desperation , Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention . The \" Cainhoy riot \" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \" Brick Church \" outside Cainhoy . Blacks and whites both opened fire ; six whites and one black were killed . Grant , upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots , finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17 , 1876 and ordered all persons , within 3 days , to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes . A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina , and the violence stopped ; election day was quiet . Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory , and for a while both acted as governor ; Hampton took the office in 1877 , after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state . = = = Indian affairs = = = Under Grant 's peace policy , wars between settlers , the federal army , and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875 . However , the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway , threatened to unravel Grant 's peace policy , as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold . Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877 . One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 . Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875 , to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877 . = = = = Modoc War = = = = In January 1873 , Grant 's Native American peace policy was challenged . Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term , fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border . The Modocs , led by Captain Jack , killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position . Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission . Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby , but Captain Jack killed him . Reverend Eleazar Thomas , a Methodist minister , was also killed . Alfred B. Meacham , an Indian Agent , was severely wounded . The murders shocked the nation , and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated . Grant overruled Sherman ; Captain Jack was executed , and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory . This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant 's peace policy , according to historian Robert M. Utley . = = = = Red River War = = = = In 1874 , war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker , leader of the Comanche , led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River , at Adobe Walls , Texas . The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign , and , with few casualties on either side , forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies . Grant , who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan , imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida . = = = = Bureau of Indian Affairs corruption = = = = In 1874 , massive fraud prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs under Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano . This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant 's Indian peace policy . Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow . Secretary Delano had allowed \" Indian Attorneys \" who were paid by Native American tribes $ 8.00 a day plus food and traveling expenses for sham representation in Washington . Other corruption charges were brought up against Secretary Delano and he was forced to resign . In 1875 , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \" Indian Attorneys \" access to Washington . Grant 's \" Quaker \" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government . = = = = Great Sioux War = = = = In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory . White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . In 1875 , to avoid conflict President Grant met with Red Cloud , chief of the Sioux , at Washington , D.C. , and offered $ 25,000 from the government to purchase the land . The offer was declined . On November 3 , 1875 at a White House meeting , Phil Sheridan claimed to the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers ; Grant capitulated ; ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation . Sheridan used a strategy of convergence , using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation . On June 25 , 1876 , one of these columns , led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and was slaughtered . Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 American Indians . Custer 's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation . Sheridan avenged Custer , pacified the northern Plains , and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation . On August 15 , 1876 President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $ 1,000,000 in rations , while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills , except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103 meridian . On August 28 , a seven-man committee , appointed by Grant , gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance . Halfbreeds and \" squaw men \" were banished from the Sioux reservation . To receive the government rations , the Indians had to work the land . Reluctantly , on September 20 , the Indian leaders , whose people were starving , agreed to the committee 's demands and signed the agreement . During the Great Sioux War , Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap ( see below ) . Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux . Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . Custer was killed at the subsequent Battle of the Little Big Horn , a defeat for the federal army . Two months later , Grant castigated Custer in the press , saying \" I regard Custer 's massacre as a sacrifice of troops , brought on by Custer himself , that was wholly unnecessary -- wholly unnecessary . \" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer , Grant 's Peace policy became militaristic ; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops , two more forts were constructed , the army took over the Indian agencies , while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition . = = = Visited Colorado Territory = = = Grant was the first President to visit the Colorado Territory in late April 1873 , having traveled by the Union Pacific Railroad , who had made a special presidential car . President Grant stayed at the residence of Governor Samuel H. Elbert , whom Grant had appointed earlier in April . Grant 's presidential party included his wife , daughter Nellie , and his private secretary Orville E. Babcock . At a reception held by Governor Elbert at Guard Hall , Grant was met by many white people who aggressively sought his handshake . Grant met with 30 to 40 Ute Indians , who had desired to see the \" Great Father \" , and shook their hands . Former Colorado Territory Governors John Evans and Edward M. McCook also met with Grant while he visited the Colorado Territory . President Grant was impressed by Colorado 's \" magnifigant scenery \" and expressed his desire to revisit the territory . = = = Civil rights = = = = = = = Civil Rights Act of 1875 = = = = Throughout his presidency , Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans , \" irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments , hotels , and places of entertainment . This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States . The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872 . = = = = Polygamy and Chinese prostitution = = = = In October 1875 , Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly . He told Utah territorial governor , George W. Emery , that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons . However , on December 7 , 1875 after his return to Washington , Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual state of the Union address that as \" an institution polygamy should be banished from the land \u2026 \" Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women . Grant advocated that a second law , stronger than the Morrill Act , be passed to \" punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality . \" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution , saying that it was \" no less an evil \" than polygamy . = = = Secular education = = = Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools . In a September 1875 speech , Grant advocated \" security of free thought , free speech , and free press , pure morals , unfettered religious sentiments , and of equal rights and privileges to all men , irrespective of nationality , color , or religion . \" In regard to public education , Grant endorsed that every child should receive \" the opportunity of a good common school education , unmixed with sectarian , pagan , or atheist tenets . Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private schools ... Keep the church and the state forever separate . \" = = = Support for Jews = = = Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders . The Jewish community was angry with Grant , and feared for their status in America even though President Lincoln forced Grant to rescind the order immediately . Grant publicly apologized for it in 1868 . When he became president in 1869 , he set out to make amends . Historian Jonathan Sarna argues : Eager to prove that he was above prejudice , Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and , in the name of human rights , he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania . Time and again , partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11 , Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality .... Through his appointments and policies , Grant rejected calls for a ' Christian nation ' and embraced Jews as insiders in America , part of \" we the people . \" During his administration , Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene , anti-Jewish prejudice declined , and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation . \u201d = = = Panic of 1873 = = = The Panic of 1873 was a worldwide depression that started when the stock market in Vienna , Austria crashed in June that year . Unsettling markets soon spread to Berlin and throughout Europe . The panic eventually reached New York when two banks went broke \u2013 the New York Warehouse & Security Company on September 18 and the major railroad financier Jay Cooke & Company on September 19 . The ensuing depression lasted 5 years , ruined thousands of businesses , depressed daily wages by 25 % from 1873 to 1876 , and brought the unemployment rate up to 14 % . The causes of the panic in the United States included the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry . Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction , thousands of industrial factories , and a strong stock market ; the South experienced a boom in agriculture . However , all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $ 20 million . A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell , during the height of the railroad speculations , contributed to unsettled markets . Boutwell created monetary stringency by selling more gold then he bought bonds . The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver . On September 20 , 1873 the Grant Administration finally responded . Grant 's Secretary of Treasury William Adams Richardson , Boutwell 's replacement , bought $ 2.5 million of five-twenty bonds with gold . On Monday , September 22 , Richardson bought $ 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased $ 5.5 million in legal tender certificates . From September 24 to September 25 the Treasury department bought $ 24 million in bonds and certificates with greenbacks . On September 29 the Secretary prepaid the interest on $ 12 million bonds bought from security banks . From October , 1873 to January 4 , 1874 Richardson kept liquidating bonds until $ 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in the Treasury . These actions did help curb the effects of the general panic by allowing more currency into the commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent . Historians have blamed the Grant administration for not responding to the crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce the negative effects of the general panic . The monetary policies of both Secretary Boutwell and Richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 . The government 's ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in the businesses that had been the source of distrust . The Panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all the limited efforts from the government . Grant 's \" cronyism \" , as Smith ( 2001 ) calls it , was apparent when he overruled Army experts to help a wartime friend , engineer , James B. Eads . Eads was building a major railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis that had been authorized by Congress in 1866 , and was nearing completion in 1873 . However , the Army Corps of Engineers chief of engineers , agreeing with steam boat interests , ordered Eads to build a canal around the bridge because the bridge would be \" a serious obstacle to navigation . \" After talking with Eads at the White House , Grant reversed the order and the 6,442 feet ( 1,964 m ) long steel arched bridge went on to completion in 1874 without a canal . = = = Economy = = = = = = = Vetoes inflation bill = = = = The rapidly accelerated industrial growth in post-Civil War America and throughout the world crashed with the Panic of 1873 . Many banks overextended their loans and went bankrupt as a result , causing a general panic throughout the nation . In an attempt to put capital into a stringent monetary economy , Secretary of Treasury William A. Richardson released $ 26 million in greenbacks . Many argued that Richardson 's monetary policies were not enough and some argued were illegal . In 1874 , Congress debated the inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed the Inflation Bill of 1874 that would release an additional $ 18 million in greenbacks up to the original $ 400,000,000 amount . Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold . Grant 's cabinet was bitterly divided over this issue while conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill . On April 22 , 1874 , after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill , Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation 's credit . = = = = Resumption of Specie Act = = = = On January 14 , 1875 , Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act , and he could not have been happier ; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act . The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman . This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1 , 1879 . The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation . At that time there were \" paper coin \" currency worth less than $ 1.00 , and these would be exchanged for silver coins . Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \" good as gold \" . In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation , this act stabilized the economy . Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration . = = = Foreign Policy = = = = = = = Virginus affair = = = = On October 31 , 1873 , a steamer Virginius , flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection ( in violation of American and Spanish law ) was intercepted and taken to Cuba . After a hasty trial , the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents , eight of whom were United States citizens ; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late . War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain , heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid , retired general Daniel Sickles . Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis , and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag . The Spanish Republic 's President Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration . Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe . With Grant 's approval , Spain was to surrender Virginius , pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed , and salute the American flag ; the episode ended quietly . = = = = Hawaiian free trade treaty = = = = In December 1874 , Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii , David Kalakaua , who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States . Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii , incorporating the Pacific islands ' sugar industry into the United States ' economy sphere . = = = = Liberian-Grebo war = = = = The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the USS Alaska to Liberia . James Milton Turner , the first African American ambassador from the United States , requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia , a former American colony . After Alaska arrived , Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia . = = Corruption and reform ( 1873-1877 ) = = Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during President Grant 's second term in office . The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft . The main scandal was the Whiskey Ring where the investigation went up to Grant himself . The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain , Robert C. Schenck , using his name to promote a worked out silver mine . The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal 's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , however , political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal . = = = Scandal cabinet and appointees = = = The most infamous of Grant 's cabinet or other presidential appointees who were involved in scandals or criminal activity : Daniel Butterfield , Assistant Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Black Friday- 1869 ) ( Forced to resign by Grant . ) William A. Richardson , Secretary of Treasury \u2013 ( Sanborn Contracts- 1874 ) ( Resigned and appointed Federal Judge by Grant . ) George H. Williams , Attorney General \u2013 ( Pratt & Boyd- 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Columbus Delano , Secretary of Interior \u2013 ( Bogus Agents \u2013 1875 ) ( Resigned ) Orville E. Babcock , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Black Friday \u2013 1869 ) ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Safe Burglary Conspiracy \u2013 1876 ) ( Acquitted in Saint Louis Whiskey Ring trials by jury due to Grant 's defense testimony in his favor . ) John McDonald , Internal Revenue Supervisor , St. Louis \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) ( Indicted and convicted ; served prison time ; claimed Grant was involved in the Whiskey Ring but did not supply any evidence . ) Horace Porter , Private Secretary \u2013 ( Whiskey Ring \u2013 1875 ) William W. Belknap , Secretary of War \u2013 ( Trading Post Ring- 1876 ) ( Resigned ; Convicted by House ; acquitted by Senate ; indictments against Belknap in Washington D.C. court were dropped by judge at request of Grant and Attorney General Alphonso Taft . ) George M. Robeson , Secretary of Navy \u2013 ( Naval Department Ring- 1876 ) ( Grant defended Robeson in State of the Union address . Grant believed Robeson had kept U.S. Navy as modern as possible during his lengthy tenure . ) = = = Sanborn contracts = = = In June 1874 , Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions . The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler , while Sanborn claimed these payments were \" expenses \" . Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions , but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with . = = = Pratt & Boyd = = = In April 1875 , it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $ 30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company , Pratt & Boyd , to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries . Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875 . = = = Delano affair = = = In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , discovered to have taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , resigned from office on October 15 , 1875 . Delano had also given bogus lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant 's own brother , Orvil Grant . Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were skillfully qualified to hold such surveying positions . The Department of Indian Affairs was being controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents who made enormous profits from the exploitation of Native American tribes . Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll . Delano who refused to make any reforms resigned under public pressure rather than Grant asking for a resignation . It was another missed opportunity for Grant to support ethics in government . However , on October 19 , 1875 , Grant made another reforming cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior . Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office and the Department of Indian Affairs by firing all the corrupt clerks and banned bogus agents . = = = Whiskey Ring prosecuted = = = In May 1875 , Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers . Prosecutions ensued , and many were put in prison . Grant 's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial . The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States , and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association . The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department . During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders , Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock . As a result , Babcock was acquitted , however , the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation . The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant 's political opponents . = = = Trading post ring = = = In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill . Belknap was allowed to resign by President Grant and as a result was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial . Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government . In late April 1876 , Grant lashed out at Lieut . Col. George A. Custer , after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant 's brother Orville and Sec . Belknap . There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering . Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President , however , Grant refused to see him three times . When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln , he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign ; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry . However , at Terry 's insistence , Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen . = = = Cattellism = = = In March 1876 , Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company , a grain supplier , in return for real estate , loans , and payment of debts . The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $ 15 million in naval construction appropriations . Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction , the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \" Cattellism \" . = = = Safe burglary conspiracy = = = In September 1876 , Orville E. Babcock , Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings , was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial . In April , corrupt building contractors in Washington , D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred . Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander , who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring . Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy , but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars . Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander , an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration . There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with . = = Reforming cabinet members = = Grant 's cabinet fluctuated between talented individuals or reformers and those involved with political patronage or party corruption . Some notable reforming cabinet members were persons who had outstanding abilities and made many positive contributions to the administration . These reformers resisted the GOP demands for patronage to select efficient civil servants . Grant 's most successful appointment , Hamilton Fish , after the confirmation on March 17 , 1869 , went immediately to work and collected , classified , indexed , and bound seven hundred volumes of correspondence . He established a new indexing system that simplified retrieving information by clerks . Fish also created a rule that applicants for consulate had to take an official written examination to receive an appointment ; previously , applicants were given positions on a patronage system solely on the recommendations of Congressmen and Senators . This raised the tone and efficiency of the consular service , and if a Congressman or Senator objected , Fish could show them that the applicant did not pass the written test . According to Fish 's biographer and historian Amos Elwood Corning in 1919 , Fish was known as \" a gentleman of wide experience , in whom the capacities of the organizer were happily united with a well balanced judgment and broad culture \" . Another reforming cabinet member was United States Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell who was confirmed by the Senate on March 12 , 1869 . His first actions were to dismiss S.M. Clark , the chief of U.S. Bureau and Engraving , and to set up a system of securing the plates that the paper money was printed on to prevent counterfeiting . Boutwell set up a system to monitor the manufacturing of money to ensure nothing would be stolen . Boutwell prevented collusion in the printing of money by preparing sets of plates for a single printing , with the red seal being imprinted in the Treasury Bureau . Boutwell persuaded Grant to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Alfred Pleasanton removed for misconduct over approving a $ 60,000 tax refund . In addition to these measures , Boutwell established a uniform mode of accounting at custom houses and ports . Boutwell along with Attorney General , Amos T. Akerman , were two of Grant 's strongest cabinet members who advocated racial justice for African Americans . During Amos T. Akerman 's tenure as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871 , thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 . Born in the North , Akerman moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves ; he fought for the Confederacy and became a Scalawag during Reconstruction , speaking out for blacks ' civil rights . As U.S. Attorney General , he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet . Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of blacks . To bolster Akerman 's investigation , Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan and to gather evidence for prosecution . The investigations revealed that many whites participated in Klan activities . With this evidence , Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan 's notorious white robe and hood disguises . When the Klan ignored the proclamation , Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan . Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870 \u2013 the first Solicitor General and native Kentuckian Benjamin Bristow \u2013 and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years in the turbulent Reconstruction era . As perhaps Grant 's most popular cabinet reformer , Benjamin H. Bristow was appointed Secretary of Treasury in June 1874 . Bristow had served ably as Solicitor General of the United States from 1870 to 1872 , prosecuting many Ku Klux Klan 's men who violated African American voting rights . When Bristow assumed office he immediately made an aggressive attack on corruption in the department . Bristow discovered that the Treasury was not receiving the full amount of tax revenue from whiskey distillers and manufacturers from several Western cities , primarily St. Louis , Missouri . Bristow discovered in 1874 that the Government alone was being defrauded by $ 1.2 million . On May 13 , 1875 , armed with enough information , Bristow struck hard at the ring , seized the distilleries , and made hundreds of arrests ; the Whiskey Ring ceased to exist . Although President Grant and Bristow were not on friendly terms , Bristow sincerely desired to save Grant 's reputation from scandal . At the end of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions in 1876 , there were 230 indictments , 110 convictions , and $ 3 million in tax revenues returned to the Treasury Department . In 1875 , Grant paired up Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow with U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont , a Yale graduate . The appointment was popularly accepted by the public as Bristow and Pierrepont successfully prosecuted members of the Whiskey Ring . Before becoming U.S. Attorney General , Pierrepont was part of a reforming group known as the \" Committee of Seventy \" and was successful at shutting down William M. Tweed 's corrupt contracting Ring while he was a New York U.S. Attorney in 1870 . Although Grant 's reputation was vastly improved , Pierrepont had shown indifference in 1875 to the plight of freedmen by circumventing Federal intervention when White racists terrorized Mississippi 's African American citizens over a fraudulent Democratic election . Every cabinet appointment made by Grant came with a political cost . When President Grant was in a bind to find a replacement for Secretary of War William W. Belknap , who abruptly resigned in 1876 amidst scandal , he turned to his good friend Alphonso Taft from Cincinnati . Taft , who accepted , served ably as Secretary of War until being transferred to the Attorney General position . As Secretary of War , Taft reduced military expenditures and made it so that no post-traderships would be given to any person except on the recommendation of the officers at the post . Grant then appointed Taft as U.S. Attorney General . Taft was a wise scholar and jurist educated at Yale University , and the Attorney General position suited him the best . During the controversial Presidential Election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden , Attorney General Taft and House Representative J. Proctor Knott had many meetings to decide the outcome of the controversial election . The result of the Taft-Knott negotiations , the Electoral Commission Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant on January 29 , 1877 ; it created a 15 panel bipartisan committee to elect the next President . Hayes won the Presidency by one electoral vote two days before the March 4 , 1877 Inauguration . Alphonso Taft was the father of future president William H. Taft . In 1875 , the U.S. Department of the Interior was in serious disrepair with corruption and incompetence . The result was that United States Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano , reportedly having taken bribes to secure fraudulent land grants , was forced to resign from office on October 15 , 1875 . On October 19 , 1875 , in a personal effort of reform , Grant appointed Zachariah Chandler to the position and was confirmed by the Senate in December 1875 . Chandler immediately went to work on reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office . Chandler had discovered that fictitious clerks were earning money and that other clerks were earning money without performing services . Chandler simplified the patent application procedure and as a result reduced costs . Chandler , under President Grant 's orders , fired all corrupt clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Chandler also banned the practice of Native American agents , known as \" Indian Attorneys \" who were being paid $ 8.00 a day plus expenses for supposedly representing their tribes in Washington . Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office . He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes , postal clerks and letter carriers . He introduced the penny post card and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties . A Radical , he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant 's coalition . He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent . The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government 's expense . = = Election of 1876 = = During the presidential election of 1876 , the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden . Results were split . Tilden received 51 % of the popular vote ; Hayes 48 % ; while 20 key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute . Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent . Grant was watchful ; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission ; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power . On January 29 , 1877 Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15 panel bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes . The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes ; Tilden received 184 . Hayes became the 19th President of the United States after being awarded 3 electoral votes from the state of Colorado . Grant 's personal honesty , firmness , and even handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted . = = Judicial appointments = = Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States . The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of Robert C. Grier and Congress 's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court . Grant appointed former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar . Neither man would take his seat : Stanton was confirmed , but died before he took office ; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate , which defeated his nomination 24-33 . Following a cabinet discussion , Grant submitted two more names to the Senate : William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley . Strong was a former justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia . Bradley , a New Jersey lawyer , also had a successful private practice . Both men were railroad lawyers , and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold , which had been decided the same day they were nominated . That case , which was unpopular with business interests , held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold , not greenbanks . Nonetheless , both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed . After Grant 's reelection , another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice Samuel Nelson . Grant nominated Ward Hunt , a New York state judge and friend of Senator Roscoe Conkling , to replace him . Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and , like Nelson , upheld Reconstruction legislation . He served on the court until 1882 . In May 1873 , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly . Grant waited several months before offering the seat to Conkling in November . Conkling declined , as did Senator Timothy Howe of Wisconsin . Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating Caleb Cushing , as well , before submitting the name of his attorney general , George Henry Williams . The Senate had a dim view of Williams 's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination . Grant stuck to his choice , but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874 . Fish suggested nominating Hoar again , but Grant instead chose Cushing . Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field , but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination . Grant finally turned to Morrison Waite , a respectable ( if little-known ) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the Alabama claims arbitration . Waite was unanimously approved two days later , on January 21 , 1874 . Waite was an uncontroversial nominee , but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions ( United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank ) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans . = = Administration and Cabinet = = = = = Supreme Court appointments = = = Grant appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Edwin M. Stanton \u2013 1869 ( died before taking seat ) William Strong \u2013 1870 Joseph P. Bradley \u2013 1870 Ward Hunt \u2013 1873 Morrison Remick Waite ( Chief Justice ) \u2013 1874 = = = States admitted to the Union = = = Colorado \u2013 August 1 , 1876 Colorado came into the Union just in time to give enough electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes to win the Presidential Election of 1876 . = = = Vetoes = = = Grant vetoed more bills then any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses . 45 were regular vetoes , and 48 of them were pocket vetoes . Grant had 4 vetoes overridden by Congress . = = = Government agencies instituted = = = Department of Justice ( 1870 ) Office of the Solicitor General ( 1870 ) United States Civil Service Commission ( 1871 ) ; Congressional appropriations expired in 1873 , however , the commission continued to function . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 renewed appropriations and enhanced the federal power and scope of the commission . Grant 's U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government 's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government . Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments . Office of the Surgeon General ( 1871 ) Army Weather Bureau ( currently known as the National Weather Service ) ( 1870 ) = = = Presidential succession 1875-1877 = = = When Grant 's second term Vice President and Cabinet member Henry Wilson died in office on November 22 , 1875 , by 1792 Statue , President pro tempore of the Senate , then Michigan Republican Senator Thomas W. Ferry , was next in line of succession to the president . On March 2 , 1877 Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared by Congress to be elected President having received a majority of electoral votes . President Grant believed an insurrection by the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden 's supporters over the controversial Election of 1876 could take place and wanted to make sure that any Democratic attempt to seize by force Hayes ' public inauguration ceremony would fail . Since March 4 , 1877 was a Sunday , President Grant secretly had Hayes take the oath of office in the Red Room of the White House on March 3 , becoming the first president to take the oath of office in the White House . No disturbance took place and Hayes formally took the oath of president on Monday , March 5 , 1877 . = = Presidential reputation = = Grant was the first President since Andrew Jackson to serve two full terms in office . The 40 years that separated their administrations marks the longest time span between presidents without one serving two terms . The legacy of President Grant is one of American civil rights , international diplomacy , scandals , and a boom-and-bust national economy . In terms of civil rights , Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise . Grant defeated the Klan by sending in the Justice Department , backed by the Army . Grant 's 1868 Presidential campaign slogan \" Let us have peace \" rang true when his State Department resolved crises with Britain and Spain , implementing the new concept of International Arbitration . The scandals revealed that Grant reacted too readily to protect his team , to cover up misdeeds , and to get rid of whistle blowers and reformers . It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War , rapid industrialization , and Westward expansionism . His acceptance of gifts from wealthy associates showed poor judgment . He distrusted reformers as busybodies who were interfering with party patronage . He was reluctant to prosecute cabinet members and appointees viewed as \" honest \" friends , and those who were convicted were set free with presidential pardons after serving a brief time in prison . His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while President and afterward . Despite the scandals , by the end of Grant 's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior ( 1875 ) , Treasury ( 1874 ) , and Justice ( 1875 ) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members . The State Departement under Secretary Hamilton Fish was run efficiently and virtually free from scandal for Grant 's two terms in office . The Postal Service was cleaned up by reformer Post Master Marshall Jewell ( 1875 ) , who aided Benjamin Bristow shut down the Whiskey Ring . The Department of War was cleaned up by Secretary Alphonso Taft , after the resignation of Secretary William Belknap in 1876 . Grant 's personal Secretary Orville Babcock was out of the White House by 1876 . The Department of Navy , under Secretary George Robeson , remained unreformed , however , Robeson did implement U.S. Naval resurgence after the Virginius Incident in 1873 . Grant 's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South . Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda , the Republican party at the end of Grant 's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies . His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party , which lost heavily in 1874 . His personal will often strayed from normal Presidential orthodoxy , and his administration defied the American tradition of a government run without political corruption and favoritism . Grant 's financial policies favored Wall Street , but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with . Revisionist historians during the first half of the Twentieth Century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant 's Presidency as a corrupt despot . However , the tide is beginning to turn concerning Grant 's presidential legacy . Frank Scaturro , who is credited with spearheading the movement to restore Grant 's Tomb while only a college student , has since written the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant 's presidency in a positive light . President Grant Reconsidered has altered the perception of how history and historians view Grant 's presidency . At the time of its publication the Weekly Standard said that Scaturro 's work was a \" convincing case that Grant was a strong and , in many important respects , successful president . It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history . ... Scaturro 's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire progressive-New Deal Tradition . And Presidential Studies Quarterly stated \" It would appear that historians and the press have been unkind in their evaluation of Grant 's two term presidency . Scaturro does well in his reconsideration . Now modern scholars are individually evaluating Grant 's Presidency rather than relying on traditional Presidential polls that have given Grant low rankings . Since Scaturro 's publication in 1998 , extensive biographies of President Grant have been written by such notable historians as 2002 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography Jean Edward Smith , Grant , Josiah H Bunting III , Ulysses S. Grant : The American Presidents Series : The 18th President and most recently H.W. Brands , The Man Who Saved the Union : Ulysses Grant in War and Peace . These venerable historians have indeed reconsidered Grant 's presidency and like Scaturro have reached a much more favorable opinion than early twentieth century works . = = Civil rights record = = Grant proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other President . He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan , reducing violence and intimidation in the South . He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation . Grant 's relationship with Charles Sumner , the leader in promoting civil rights , was shattered by the Senator 's opposition to Grant 's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty . Grant retaliated , firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee . Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant 's reelection . Grant 's presidency was committed to treat Native Americans as individual wards of the state under a \" peace \" policy and encouraged their citizenship . Native Americans were eventually given full U.S. citizenship in 1924 under the Indian Citizenship Act signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge . Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In his sixth message to Congress , he summed up his own views , \" While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter , as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference . \" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten . = = = By author = = = Brands , H.

                    "text": "Star Trek = Star Trek is an American science fiction entertainment franchise created by Gene Roddenberry and owned by CBS and Paramount Pictures . The television series Star Trek : The Original Series , Star Trek : The Animated Series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Star Trek : Voyager , Star Trek : Enterprise , Star Trek : Discovery as well as the Star Trek film franchise make up the franchise 's canon . The first series , now referred to as The Original Series , debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC . It followed the galactic adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise , an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century interstellar \" United Federation of Planets \" . In creating the first Star Trek , Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train , the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver 's Travels . In fact , the original series was originally described as Wagon Train to the Stars . These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek : The Animated Series and six feature films . Four spin-off television series were eventually produced : Star Trek : The Next Generation followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series ; Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : Voyager , set contemporaneously with The Next Generation ; and Star Trek : Enterprise , set before the original series , in the early days of human interstellar travel . Four additional The Next Generation feature films were produced . In 2009 , the film franchise underwent a relaunch with a prequel to the original series set in an alternate timeline titled simply Star Trek . This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original show . A sequel to that film , Star Trek Into Darkness , premiered on May 16 , 2013 . A thirteenth film feature and sequel , Star Trek Beyond , was released in July 2016 , to coincide with the franchise 's 50th anniversary . A new Star Trek TV series , titled Star Trek : Discovery , will premiere in January 2017 on the digital platform CBS All Access . Star Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades . Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or Trekkers . The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games , figurines , novels , toys , and comics . Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008 . At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world . The series has its own full-fledged constructed language , Klingon . Several parodies have been made of Star Trek . In addition , viewers have produced several fan productions . Star Trek is noted for its influence on the world outside of science fiction . It has been cited as an inspiration for several technological inventions , including the cell phone and tablet computers . The franchise is also noted for its progressive civil rights stances . The Original Series included one of television 's first multiracial casts . Star Trek references can be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the animated series South Park . = = Conception and setting = = As early as 1964 , Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science-fiction series that would become Star Trek . Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer space \u2014 a so-called \" Wagon Train to the Stars \" ( like the popular Western TV series ) \u2014 he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels , intending each episode to act on two levels : as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale . Most Star Trek stories depict the adventures of humans and aliens who serve in Starfleet , the space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets . The protagonists have altruistic values , and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas . Many of the conflicts and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities . Star Trek : The Original Series addressed issues of the 1960s , just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades . Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace , the value of personal loyalty , authoritarianism , imperialism , class warfare , economics , racism , religion , human rights , sexism , feminism , and the role of technology . Roddenberry stated : \" [ By creating ] a new world with new rules , I could make statements about sex , religion , Vietnam , politics , and intercontinental missiles . Indeed , we did make them on Star Trek : we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network . \" Roddenberry intended the show to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement , though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this . He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into , if it would learn from the lessons of the past , most specifically by ending violence . An extreme example is the alien species , the Vulcans , who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions . Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal , optimistic version of the United Nations . His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability , e.g. , they opposed Roddenberry 's insistence that the Enterprise have a racially diverse crew . Star Trek has also been accused of evincing racism and imperialism , however , by frequently depicting Starfleet and the Federation trying to impose their values and customs on other planets . = = Mythology = = The central trio of Kirk , Spock and McCoy from Star Trek : The Original Series was modeled on classical mythological storytelling . William Shatner said : \u201c There is a mythological component [ to pop culture ] , especially with science fiction . It \u2019 s people looking for answers \u2013 and science fiction offers to explain the inexplicable , the same as religion tends to do \u2026 If we accept the premise that it has a mythological element , then all the stuff about going out into space and meeting new life \u2013 trying to explain it and put a human element to it \u2013 it \u2019 s a hopeful vision . All these things offer hope and imaginative solutions for the future . \u201d Richard Lutz wrote : \u201c The enduring popularity of Star Trek is due to the underlying mythology which binds fans together by virtue of their shared love of stories involving exploration , discovery , adventure and friendship that promote an egalitarian and peace loving society where technology and diversity are valued rather than feared and citizens work together for the greater good . Thus Star Trek offers a hopeful vision of the future and a template for our lives and our society that we can aspire to . \u201d = = History and production = = = = = Beginnings = = = In early 1964 , Roddenberry presented a brief treatment for a proposed Star Trek TV series to Desilu Productions comparing it to Wagon Train , \" a Wagon Train to the stars . \" Desilu worked with Roddenberry to develop the treatment into a script , which was then pitched to NBC . NBC paid to make a pilot , \" The Cage \" , starring Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike . NBC rejected The Cage , but the executives were still impressed with the concept , and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot : \" Where No Man Has Gone Before \" . The first regular episode ( \" The Man Trap \" ) of Star Trek : The Original Series aired on Thursday , September 8 , 1966 . While the show initially enjoyed high ratings , the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd ( out of 94 programs ) . Unhappy with the show 's ratings , NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season . The show 's fan base , led by Bjo Trimble , conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign , petitioning the network to keep the show on the air . NBC renewed the show , but moved it from primetime to the \" Friday night death slot \" , and substantially reduced its budget . In protest Roddenberry resigned as producer and reduced his direct involvement in Star Trek , which led to Fred Freiberger becoming producer for the show 's third and final season . Despite another letter-writing campaign , NBC cancelled the series after three seasons and 79 episodes . = = = Rebirth = = = After the original series was cancelled , Paramount Studios , which had bought the series from Desilu , licensed the broadcast syndication rights to help recoup the production losses . Reruns began in the fall of 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets . This helped Star Trek develop a cult following greater than its popularity during its original run . One sign of the series ' growing popularity was the first Star Trek convention which occurred on January 21 \u2013 23 , 1972 in New York City . Although the original estimate of attendees was only a few hundred , several thousand fans turned up . Star Trek fans continue to attend similar conventions worldwide . The series ' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise . Filmation with Paramount Television produced the first post original series show , Star Trek : The Animated Series . It ran on NBC for 22 half-hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974 . Although short-lived , typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period , the series garnered the franchise 's only \" Best Series \" Emmy Award as opposed to the franchise 's later technical ones . Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry began developing a new series , Star Trek : Phase II , in May 1975 in response to the franchise 's newfound popularity . Work on the series ended , however , when the proposed Paramount Television Service folded . Following the success of the science fiction movies Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of Phase II into the feature film , Star Trek : The Motion Picture . The film opened in North America on December 7 , 1979 , with mixed reviews from critics . The film earned $ 139 million worldwide , below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel . The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels . The success of the critically acclaimed sequel , Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , reversed the fortunes of the franchise . While the sequel grossed less than the first movie , The Wrath of Khan 's lower production costs made it net more profit . Paramount produced six Star Trek feature films between 1979 and 1991 . In response to the popularity of Star Trek feature films , the franchise returned to television with Star Trek : The Next Generation ( TNG ) in 1987 . Paramount chose to distribute it as a first-run syndication show rather than a network show . = = = After Roddenberry = = = Following Star Trek : The Motion Picture , Roddenberry 's role was changed from producer to creative consultant with minimal input to the films while being heavily involved with the creation of Star Trek : The Next Generation . Roddenberry died on October 24 , 1991 , giving executive producer Rick Berman control of the franchise . Star Trek had become known to those within Paramount as \" the franchise \" , because of its great success and recurring role as a tent pole for the studio when other projects failed . TNG had the highest ratings of any Star Trek series and became the # 1 syndicated show during the last years of its original seven-season run . In response to TNG 's success , Paramount released a spin-off series Deep Space Nine in 1993 . While never as popular as TNG , the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons . In January 1995 , a few months after TNG ended , Paramount released a fourth TV series , Voyager . Star Trek saturation reached a peak in the mid-1990s with DS9 and Voyager airing concurrently and three of the four TNG-based feature films released in 1994 , 1996 , and 1998 . By 1998 , Star Trek was Paramount 's most important property ; the enormous profits of \" the franchise \" funded much of the rest of the studio 's operations . Voyager became the flagship show of the new United Paramount Network ( UPN ) and thus the first major network Star Trek series since the original . After Voyager ended , UPN produced Enterprise , a prequel TV series to the original show . Enterprise did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series ' third season . Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the Original Series . Paramount renewed Enterprise for a fourth season , but moved it to the Friday night death slot . Like the Original Series , Enterprise ratings dropped during this time slot , and UPN cancelled Enterprise at the end of its fourth season . Enterprise aired its final episode on May 13 , 2005 . Fan groups , \" Save Enterprise \" , attempted to save the series and tried to raise $ 30 million to privately finance a fifth season of Enterprise . Though the effort garnered considerable press , the fan drive failed to save the series . The cancellation of Enterprise ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of Star Trek programming on television . The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film Nemesis , cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise . Paramount relieved Berman , the franchise producer , of control of Star Trek . = = = Reboot = = = Paramount turned down several proposals in the mid-2000s to restart the franchise . These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer , Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski , and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner . The studio also turned down an animated web series . Instead , Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007 . Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer , J. J. Abrams , had the freedom to reinvent the feel of Trek . The team created the franchise 's eleventh film , titled simply Star Trek , releasing it in May 2009 . The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show . Star Trek was a prequel of the original series set in an alternate timeline . This gave the film and future sequels to it freedom from the need to conform to the franchise 's canonical timeline . The eleventh Star Trek film 's marketing campaign targeted non-fans , even stating in the film 's advertisements that \" this is not your father 's Star Trek \" . The film earned considerable critical and financial success , grossing in inflation-adjusted dollars more box office sales than any previous Star Trek film . The plaudits include the franchise 's first Academy Award ( for makeup ) . The film 's major cast members are contracted for two sequels . Paramount 's sequel to the 2009 film , Star Trek Into Darkness , premiered in Sydney , Australia on April 23 , 2013 , but the film did not release in the United States until May 17 , 2013 . While the film was not as successful in the North American box office as its predecessor , internationally , in terms of box office receipts , Into Darkness was the most successful of the franchise . A thirteenth film entitled Star Trek Beyond was released on July 22 , 2016 . Star Trek will return to subscription-television in January 2017 . The new series , titled Star Trek : Discovery , will be the first series produced specifically for CBS All Access . Episodes will also be availablle on Netflix within 24 hours of their U.S. premieres . = = Television series = = Six television series make up the bulk of the Star Trek mythos : The Original Series , The Animated Series , The Next Generation , Deep Space Nine , Voyager , and Enterprise . All the different versions in total amount to 726 Star Trek episodes across the 30 seasons of the TV series . = = = The Original Series ( 1966 \u2013 69 ) = = = Star Trek : The Original Series or \" TOS \" debuted in the United States on NBC on September 8 , 1966 . The show tells the tale of the crew of the starship Enterprise and its five-year mission \" to boldly go where no man has gone before . \" The original 1966 \u2013 1969 television series featured William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk , Leonard Nimoy as Spock , DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard \" Bones \" McCoy , James Doohan as Montgomery \" Scotty \" Scott , Nichelle Nichols as Uhura , George Takei as Hikaru Sulu , and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov . During the series ' original run , it earned several nominations for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and won twice : for the two-parter \" The Menagerie \" and the Harlan Ellison-written episode \" The City on the Edge of Forever \" . NBC canceled the show after three seasons ; the last original episode aired on June 3 , 1969 . The petition near the end of the second season to save the show signed by many Caltech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would , however , indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings , it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students . The series later became popular in reruns and found a cult following . = = = The Animated Series ( 1973 \u2013 74 ) = = = Star Trek : The Animated Series , produced by Filmation , ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974 . Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from The Original Series , and many of the writers who worked on The Original Series , D. C. Fontana , David Gerrold , and Paul Schneider , wrote for the series . While the animated format allowed the producers to create more exotic alien landscapes and life forms , animation errors and liberal reuse of shots and musical cues have tarnished the series ' reputation . Although it was originally sanctioned by Paramount , which owned the Star Trek franchise following its acquisition of Desilu in 1967 , Gene Roddenberry often spoke of TAS as non-canon . Star Trek writers have used elements of the animated series in later live-action series and movies , and as of June 2007 , the Animated Series has references in the library section of the official Startrek.com web site officially bringing the series into the franchise 's main canon . The Animated Series won Star Trek 's first Emmy Award on May 15 , 1975 . Star Trek TAS briefly returned to television in the mid-1980s on the children 's cable network Nickelodeon . Nickelodeon 's Evan McGuire greatly admired the show and used its various creative components as inspiration for his short series called Piggly Wiggly Hears A Sound which never aired . Nickelodeon parent Viacom would purchase Paramount in 1994 . In the early 1990s , the Sci-Fi Channel also began rerunning TAS . The complete TAS was also released on Laserdisc format during the 1980s . The complete series was first released in the USA on eleven volumes of VHS tapes in 1989 . All 22 episodes were released on DVD in 2006 . = = = The Next Generation ( 1987 \u2013 1994 ) = = = Star Trek : The Next Generation , also known as \" TNG \" , takes place about a century after The Original Series ( 2364 \u2013 2370 ) . It features a new starship , the Enterprise-D , and a new crew led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) and Commander William Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) . Some crewmembers represent new alien races , including Deanna Troi , a half-Betazoid counselor played by Marina Sirtis . Michael Dorn plays Worf , the first Klingon officer in Starfleet , alongside Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher , LeVar Burton as chief engineer Geordi La Forge , the android Data portrayed by Brent Spiner , and Dr. Crusher 's son Wesley Crusher played by Wil Wheaton . The show premiered on September 28 , 1987 , and ran for seven seasons , ending on May 23 , 1994 . It had the highest ratings of any of the Star Trek series and became the # 1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run , allowing it to act as a springboard for ideas in other series . Many relationships and races introduced in TNG became the basis of episodes in Deep Space 9 and Voyager . During its run it earned several Emmy awards and nominations \u2013 including a nomination for Best Dramatic Series during its final season \u2013 two Hugo Awards and a Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming for the episode \" The Big Goodbye \" . = = = Deep Space Nine ( 1993 \u2013 99 ) = = = Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , also known as \" DS9 \" , takes place during the last years and the immediate post-years of The Next Generation ( 2369 \u2013 2375 ) and aired for seven seasons , debuting the week of January 3 , 1993 . Like Star Trek : The Next Generation , it aired in syndication in the United States and Canada . Unlike the other Star Trek series , DS9 takes place primarily on a space station rather than aboard a starship . The show begins after the brutal Cardassian occupation of the planet Bajor . The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian built space station , Deep Space Nine , near Bajor . After the Federation takes control of the station , the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy . The show chronicles the events of the station 's crew , led by Commander ( later Captain ) Benjamin Sisko , played by Avery Brooks , and Major ( later Colonel ) Kira Nerys , played by Nana Visitor . Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor , Sisko 's spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets , and in later seasons a war with the Dominion . Deep Space Nine stands apart from earlier Trek series for its lengthy serialized storytelling , conflict within the crew , and religious themes \u2014 all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and The Next Generation . Nevertheless , he was informed before his death of DS9 , making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry . = = = Voyager ( 1995 \u2013 2001 ) = = = Star Trek : Voyager ran for seven seasons , airing from January 16 , 1995 , to May 23 , 2001 , launching a new Paramount-owned television network UPN . It features Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway , the first female commanding officer in a leading role of a Star Trek series , and Commander Chakotay , played by Robert Beltran . Voyager takes place at about the same time period as Deep Space Nine and the years following that show 's end ( 2371 \u2013 2378 ) . The premiere episode has the USS Voyager and its crew pursue a Maquis ( Federation rebels ) ship . Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70,000 light-years from Earth . Faced with a 75-year voyage to Earth , the crew must learn to work together to overcome challenges on their long and perilous journey home while also seeking ways to shorten the voyage . Like Deep Space Nine , early seasons of Voyager feature more conflict between its crewmembers than seen in later episodes . Such conflict often arises from friction between \" by-the-book \" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager . Eventually , though , they settle their differences , after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of The Original Series . The starship Voyager , isolated from its home , faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in shows based in the Alpha Quadrant . Later seasons , however , brought an influx of characters and cultures from prior shows , the Borg , Q , the Ferengi , Romulans , Klingons , Cardassians and cast members of The Next Generation . = = = Enterprise ( 2001 \u2013 05 ) = = = Star Trek : Enterprise , originally titled Enterprise , is a prequel to the original Star Trek series . It aired from September 26 , 2001 to May 13 , 2005 . Enterprise takes place in the 2150s , some 90 years after the events of Zefram Cochrane 's first warp flight and about a decade before the founding of the Federation . The show centers on the voyages of Earth 's first warp-five capable starship , the Enterprise , commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer ( played by Scott Bakula ) , and the Vulcan Sub-Commander T 'Pol ( played by Jolene Blalock ) . During the show 's first two seasons , Enterprise featured self-contained episodes , like The Original Series , The Next Generation and Voyager . The third season consisted of one arc , \" Xindi mission \" , which had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of Deep Space 9 . Season 4 consisted of several two to three episode mini-arcs . The final season showed the origins of elements seen in earlier series , and it rectified and resolved some core continuity problems between the various Star Trek series . Ratings for Enterprise started strong but declined rapidly . Although critics received the fourth season well , both fans and the cast reviled the series finale , partly because of the episode 's focus on the guest appearance of members of The Next Generation cast . The cancellation of Enterprise ended an 18-year run of back-to-back new Star Trek shows beginning with The Next Generation in 1987 . = = = Discovery ( 2017 \u2013 ) = = = On November 2 , 2015 , it was announced that a new Star Trek TV series is in development by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman . The new series will premiere on CBS All Access in January 2017 . = = Feature films = = Paramount Pictures has produced thirteen Star Trek feature films , the most recent being released in July 2016 . The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series ; the seventh film , Generations was designed as a transition from that cast to The Next Generation television series ; the next three films , 8 \u2013 10 , focused completely on the Next Generation cast . The eleventh and twelfth films take place in an alternate timeline from the rest of the franchise set with a new cast playing the original series characters , and with Leonard Nimoy as an elderly Spock providing a physical link to the original timeline . This alternate timeline has been named by CBS , for the computer came Star Trek Online , the Kelvin Timeline . Star Trek , Into Darkness , and Beyond occur in a separate timeline from the rest of the series . = = Merchandise = = Many licensed products are based on the Star Trek franchise . Merchandising is very lucrative for both studio and actors ; by 1986 Nimoy had earned more than $ 500,000 from royalties . Products include novels , comic books , video games , and other materials , which are generally considered non-canon . = = = Books = = = Since 1967 , hundreds of original novels , short stories , and television and movie adaptations have been published . The first original Star Trek novel was Mission to Horatius by Mack Reynolds , which was published in hardcover by Whitman Books in 1968 . The first publisher of Star Trek fiction aimed at adult readers was Bantam Books . In 1970 , James Blish wrote the first original Star Trek novel published by Bantam , Spock Must Die ! . Pocket Books is the publisher of Star Trek novels . Prolific Star Trek novelists include Peter David , Diane Carey , Keith R. A. DeCandido , J. M. Dillard , Diane Duane , Michael Jan Friedman , and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens . Several actors from the television series have also written or co-written books featuring their respective characters : William Shatner , John de Lancie , Andrew J. Robinson , J. G. Hertzler and Armin Shimerman . Voyager producer Jeri Taylor wrote two novels featuring back story for Voyager characters , and screen authors David Gerrold , D. C. Fontana , and Melinda Snodgrass have penned books , as well . A scholarly book published by Springer Science + Business Media in 2014 discusses the actualization of Star Trek 's holodeck in the future by making extensive use of artificial intelligence and cyborgs . = = = Comics = = = Star Trek-based comics have been almost continuously published since 1967 . They have been offered by several companies , including Marvel , DC , Malibu , Wildstorm , and Gold Key . Tokyopop is publishing an anthology of Next Generation-based stories presented in the style of Japanese manga . As of 2006 , IDW Publishing secured publishing rights to Star Trek comics and published a prequel to the 2009 film , Star Trek : Countdown . In 2012 , they published Volume I of Star Trek \u2013 The Newspaper Strip featuring the work of Thomas Warkentin . = = = Games = = = The Star Trek franchise has numerous games in many formats . Beginning in 1967 with a board game based on the original series and continuing through today with online and DVD games , Star Trek games continue to be popular among fans . Video games of the series include Star Trek : Legacy and Star Trek : Conquest . An MMORPG based on Star Trek called Star Trek Online was developed by Cryptic Studios and published by Perfect World . It is set in the TNG universe about 30 years after the events of Star Trek : Nemesis . The most recent video game , set in the new timeline debuted in J. J. Abrams 's film , was titled Star Trek . On June 8 , 2010 , Wiz Kids Games , which is owned by NECA , announced that they are developing a Star Trek collectible miniatures game using the HeroClix game system . = = = Magazines = = = Star Trek has led directly or indirectly to the creation of a number of magazines which focus either on science fiction or specifically on Star Trek . Starlog was a magazine which was founded in the 1970s . Initially , its focus was on Star Trek actors , but then it began to expand its scope . In 2013 , Star Trek Magazine was a significant publication from the U.K. which was sold at newsstands and also via subscription . Other magazines through the years included professional magazines as well as magazines produced by fans , referred to as \" fanzines \" . Star Trek : The Magazine was a magazine published in the U.S. which ceased publication in 2003 . = = Cultural impact = = The Star Trek media franchise is a multibillion-dollar industry , owned by CBS . Gene Roddenberry sold Star Trek to NBC as a classic adventure drama ; he pitched the show as \" Wagon Train to the Stars \" and as Horatio Hornblower in Space . The opening line , \" to boldly go where no man has gone before , \" was taken almost verbatim from a U.S. White House booklet on space produced after the Sputnik flight in 1957 . The central trio of Kirk , Spock , and McCoy was modeled on classical mythological storytelling . Star Trek and its spin-offs have proven highly popular in syndication and are shown on TV stations worldwide . The show 's cultural impact goes far beyond its longevity and profitability . Star Trek conventions have become popular among its fans , who call themselves \" trekkies \" or \" trekkers \" . An entire subculture has grown up around the show which was documented in the film Trekkies . Star Trek was the highest-ranked cult show by TV Guide . The franchise has also garnered many comparisons of the Star Wars franchise being rivals in the science fiction genre with many fans and scholars . The Star Trek franchise inspired some designers of technologies , the Palm PDA and the handheld mobile phone . Michael Jones , Chief technologist of Google Earth , has cited the tricorder 's mapping capability as one inspiration in the development of Keyhole / Google Earth . The Tricorder X Prize , a contest to build a medical tricorder device was announced in 2012 . Ten finalists have been selected in 2014 , and the winner will be selected in January 2016 . Star Trek also brought teleportation to popular attention with its depiction of \" matter-energy transport \" , with the famously misquoted phrase \" Beam me up , Scotty \" entering the vernacular . The Star Trek replicator is credited in the scientific literature with inspiring the field of diatom nanotechnology . In 1976 , following a letter-writing campaign , NASA named its prototype space shuttle Enterprise , after the fictional starship . Later , the introductory sequence to Star Trek : Enterprise included footage of this shuttle which , along with images of a naval sailing vessel called the Enterprise , depicted the advancement of human transportation technology . Beyond Star Trek 's fictional innovations , its contributions to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast . While more common in subsequent years , in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman , a Russian navigator , a black female communications officer , and a Vulcan-Human first officer . Captain Kirk 's and Lt. Uhura 's kiss , in the episode \" Plato 's Stepchildren \" , was also daring , and is often mis-cited as being American television 's first scripted , interracial kiss , even though several other interracial kisses predated this one . = = = Parodies = = = Early TV comedy sketch parodies of Star Trek included a famous sketch on Saturday Night Live titled \" The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise \" , with John Belushi as Kirk , Chevy Chase as Spock and Dan Aykroyd as McCoy . In the 1980s , Saturday Night Live did a sketch with William Shatner reprising his Captain Kirk role in The Restaurant Enterprise , preceded by a sketch in which he played himself at a Trek convention angrily telling fans to \" Get a Life \" , a phrase that has become part of Trek folklore . In Living Color continued the tradition in a sketch where Captain Kirk is played by a fellow Canadian Jim Carrey . A feature-length film that indirectly parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest . This film is based on the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest , modeled heavily on Star Trek , believe that what they are seeing is real . Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody . Star Trek has been blended with Gilbert and Sullivan at least twice . The North Toronto Players presented a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan titled H.M.S. Starship Pinafore : The Next Generation in 1991 and an adaptation by Jon Mullich of Gilbert & Sullivan 's H.M.S. Pinafore that sets the operetta in the world of Star Trek has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols , D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold . A similar blend of Gilbert and Sullivan and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009 . The show was titled Star Drek : The Generation After That . It presented an original story with Gilbert and Sullivan melodies . Both The Simpsons and Futurama television series and others have had many individual episodes parodying Star Trek or with Trek allusions . An entire series of films and novels from Finland titled Star Wreck also parodies Star Trek . In August 2010 , the members of the Internal Revenue Service created a Star Trek themed training video for a conference . Revealed to the public in 2013 , the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds in a congressional investigation . Star Trek has been parodied in several non-English movies , including the German Traumschiff Surprise - Periode 1 which features a gay version of The Original Series bridge crew and a Turkish film that spoofs that same series ' episode \" The Man Trap \" in one of the series of films based on the character Turist \u00d6mer . = = = Notable fan fiction = = = Although Star Trek has been off the air since 2005 , CBS and Paramount pictures have allowed fan-produced shows to be created . While not officially part of the Star Trek universe , several veteran Star Trek actors , actresses , and writers have contributed their talents to many of these productions . While none of these films have been created for profit , several fan productions have turned to crowdfunding from sites , such as Kickstarter to help with production costs . Two series set during the TOS time period are Star Trek Continues and the Hugo award nominated Star Trek : Phase II . Another series , Star Trek : Hidden Frontier , takes place on the Briar Patch , a region of space introduced in Star Trek Insurrection . It has had over 50 episodes produced , and has two spin-off series , Star Trek : Odyssey and Star Trek : The Helena Chronicles . Several standalone fan films have been created including Star Trek : Of Gods and Men . Future fan films include Star Trek : Axanar . Audio only fan productions includes Star Trek : The Continuing Mission . Several fan film parodies have also been created . = = Awards and honors = = Of the various science fiction awards for drama , only the Hugo Award dates back as far as the original series . In 1968 , all five nominees for a Hugo Award were individual episodes of Star Trek , as were three of the five nominees in 1967 . The only Star Trek series not even to get a Hugo nomination are the animated series and Voyager , though only the original series and Next Generation ever won the award . No Star Trek feature film has ever won a Hugo , though a few were nominated . In 2008 , the fan-made episode of Star Trek : New Voyages entitled \" World Enough and Time \" was nominated for the Hugo for Best Short Drama . The two Star Trek series to win multiple Saturn awards during their run were The Next Generation ( twice winning for best television series ) and Voyager ( twice winning for best actress \u2013 Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan ) . The original series retroactively won a Saturn Award for best DVD release . Several Star Trek films have won Saturns including categories best actor , actress , director , costume design , and special effects . However , Star Trek has never won a Saturn for best make-up . As for non science fiction specific awards , the Star Trek series has won 31 Emmy Awards . The eleventh Star Trek film won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Makeup , the franchise 's first Academy Award . = = Corporate ownership = = At Star Trek 's creation , Norway Productions , Roddenberry 's production company , shared ownership with Desilu Productions and , after Gulf + Western acquired Desilu in 1967 , with Paramount Pictures , the conglomerate 's film studio . Paramount did not want to own the unsuccessful show ; net profit was to be shared between Norway , Desilu / Paramount , Shatner , and NBC but Star Trek lost money , and the studio did not expect to syndicate it . In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry , but he could not afford the $ 150,000 ( $ 914,000 in 2007 ) price . In 1989 , Gulf + Western renamed itself as Paramount Communications , and in 1994 merged with Viacom . In 2005 , Viacom divided into CBS Corporation , whose CBS Television Studios subsidiary retained the Star Trek brand , and Viacom , whose Paramount Pictures subsidiary retained the Star Trek film library and rights to make additional films , along with video distribution rights to the TV series on behalf of CBS .",

                    "text": "Gwen Cooper = Gwen Cooper is a fictional character portrayed by Welsh actress Eve Myles in the BBC science-fiction television programme Torchwood , a spin-off of the long-running series Doctor Who . The lead female character , Gwen featured in every episode of the show 's 2006-2011 run , as well as two 2008 crossover episodes of Doctor Who . Gwen appears in Expanded Universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks , comic books and radio plays . Within the series narrative , Gwen is a South Wales Police officer who discovers the mysterious Torchwood Institute , into which she is recruited by Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) . Gwen initially operates as a field agent , bringing a humane and rounded approach to the team 's investigations of the extraterrestrial . Gwen 's work begins to take a toll on her personal life in series one ( 2006 ) , but her marriage to Rhys ( Kai Owen ) keeps her grounded , even as her responsibilities increase in series two ( 2008 ) . In Children of Earth ( 2009 ) and Miracle Day ( 2011 ) , after Torchwood is destroyed to conceal a government conspiracy , a much hardened Gwen operates under her own mandate as the world undergoes crises linked with unprecedented alien threats . Gwen is introduced as an audience surrogate , in the mould of the \" girl next door \" archetype , much like the perennial \" companion \" character in Doctor Who . However , as the series progressed , the production team chose to emphasise contradictory aspects to her character by having Gwen make ethically dubious decisions . As the show progresses , and even after becoming a mother , Gwen evolves into a more militant action heroine and finds herself willing to make tough decisions to protect those closest to her . Reviewers have generally responded positively to the complexity of Gwen 's character and Eve Myles ' portrayal , though critics found fault with her more prosaic characterisation earlier on . Eve Myles ' portrayal of Gwen has been cited as effective in both promoting the country of Wales and combating a perceived prejudice against the Welsh accent . Myles received a Welsh BAFTA for the first series of the show and was nominated for several other acting awards across each of Torchwood 's four series ' . = = Appearances = = = = = Television = = = Gwen is introduced in the first episode of Torchwood , in which she \u2014 a Cardiff police officer \u2014 witnesses Captain Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) and his team interrogating a dead man in an alley . After investigating the Torchwood team , she locates the Torchwood Institute 's Cardiff branch , home to a team of alien hunters . Though Jack wipes her memories , they are later triggered by reports of murders committed with exotic weaponry . Torchwood 's own Suzie Costello ( Indira Varma ) is the serial killer . Gwen is present at Suzie 's attempt to kill Jack , and Suzie 's ensuing suicide . Jack reveals that he cannot die and offers Gwen a job in Torchwood . Jack and Gwen 's relationship takes on a romantic hue , despite her long-standing relationship with boyfriend Rhys ( Kai Owen ) . Gwen falls into a short-lived destructive affair with colleague Owen ( Burn Gorman ) , after a particularly traumatic experience with cannibals , which she cannot share with Rhys . Shortly afterwards , Gwen is targeted and almost killed by a vengeful undead Suzie . In their conversations , Gwen is shocked to realise the extent to which Torchwood neglected Suzie 's emotional welfare , and Suzie is resentful towards Gwen , who has replaced her both professionally , and as Owen 's lover . Wracked with guilt , Gwen confesses her affair with Owen after it ends in \" Combat \" , but she drugs Rhys with an amnesia pill so he will not remember her confession . In the series one finale , her desire to resurrect a murdered Rhys motivates her to mutiny against Jack by opening the rift in time and space which Torchwood monitors . After Jack sacrifices himself to the released supernatural demon , Gwen maintains a vigil , certain that he will resurrect . As she loses hope , giving Jack a parting kiss , he awakens and thanks her . Shortly afterwards , Jack abandons Torchwood to reunite with the mysterious \" Doctor \" from his past . In 2008 , as series two begins , Gwen has replaced Jack as team leader . When Jack returns to lead Torchwood , Gwen displays anger towards him for abandoning the team , and surprises him with the news she has become engaged . In a later episode she is forced to tell Rhys about her job at Torchwood when he assumes she is having an affair with Jack . After Rhys takes a bullet for her Gwen defies Jack by refusing to wipe Rhys ' memories , feeling humbled by her partner 's loyalty and bravery . In \" Something Borrowed \" , despite being pregnant to an alien Nostrovite , Gwen refuses to postpone the wedding to Rhys . Her marriage makes Jack remember an earlier marriage of his own . In \" Adrift \" Rhys continues to push Gwen to unburden herself from her traumatic experiences , after her attempt to re-unite families with missing children stolen by the rift goes horribly wrong . In the series finale , Gwen 's leadership skills allow her to co-ordinate Cardiff during the chaos caused by Captain John Hart ( James Marsters ) and Jack 's younger brother Gray ( Lachlan Nieboer ) . When Gray kills Gwen 's teammates Toshiko ( Naoko Mori ) and Owen , Gwen is desolate . The character makes a crossover appearance in Doctor Who alongside Jack and Ianto ( Gareth David-Lloyd ) in its 2008 series ' two-part finale , in which Torchwood help contact series protagonist the Doctor ( David Tennant ) during an invasion of the psychopathic mutant Daleks , and later must defend their headquarters from the attacking aliens . The Doctor suggests a connection to Gwyneth , a separate character portrayed by Eve Myles in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \" The Unquiet Dead \" . In Children of Earth , a five-part serial broadcast in 2009 , Gwen is a more militant heroine shaped by the increased responsibilities and pressures of her job . In part one , aliens called the 4-5-6 communicate to the world by taking possession of its children and a middle-aged man , Clem McDonald ( Paul Copley ) . Gwen investigates by visiting Clem , who \u2014 being possessed of psychic abilities \u2014 announces to her she is pregnant , which she later confirms using technology at the Torchwood Hub . Gwen is forced to defend herself from assassins after the Hub is destroyed to conceal a government conspiracy , taking Rhys on the run with her , and re-establishing Torchwood Three in a London warehouse . By making contact with government PA Lois Habiba ( Cush Jumbo ) , Gwen discovers her fugitive status and is able to survey cabinet meetings . When Ianto is killed fighting the 4-5-6 , Gwen and Rhys return to Cardiff to protect his niece and nephew from the armed forces , ordered by the government to sacrifice a percentage of the country 's children as appeasement . She feels she now understands the Doctor 's periodic absence during various crises in Earth 's history ; believing him to sometimes \" look at this planet , and turn away in shame \" . In the d\u00e9nouement of the final part , Gwen is six months pregnant when she returns Jack 's vortex manipulator to him . She insists he stay ; he leaves her behind and abandons Earth . Fourth series Miracle Day ( 2011 ) , an American co-production , re-establishes Gwen , Rhys and their daughter Anwen living reclusively in rural Wales . CIA agent Rex Matheson ( Mekhi Phifer ) renditions Gwen to the United States , believing a worldwide phenomenon wherein no one can die to be connected to Torchwood and she becomes part of a new Torchwood team alongside Jack , Rex and former CIA analyst Esther Drummond ( Alexa Havins ) . In \" The Categories of Life \" and the \" The Middle Men \" Gwen returns to Wales to rescue her ailing father Geraint ( William Thomas ) , who survived a fatal heart attack on \" Miracle Day \" , from a facility where the critically injured are incinerated . Upon her return to America her family are kidnapped as leverage to make her surrender Jack . Gwen tells Jack , now ostensibly mortal , that she would allow him to be killed to save Anwen . After Gwen is deported by senior CIA official Allen Shapiro ( John De Lancie ) because of her dissidence she focusses on protecting her father from the authorities ; enclosing him in her mother Mary 's ( Sharon Morgan ) cellar and supplying him with palliative medicine . The concluding episode , \" The Blood Line \" opens with Gwen eulogising her father as the kindest man she has ever known , before stating that she is about to kill him . When the power and profit driven conspirators behind Miracle Day try to thwart her resolve by wounding Esther , Gwen declares she will sacrifice her entire Torchwood team to restore order . She shoots Jack through the heart , allowing his unique blood to prompt an ancient phenomenon to reset the human morphic field . As Geraint and other \" Miracle Day \" survivors pass away peacefully , Jack 's immortality is restored . Gwen is shocked to discover at Esther 's funeral that Rex is now immortal too . = = = Literature = = = Gwen appears in all Torchwood novels published by BBC Books to date . The first wave , Another Life , Border Princes , and Slow Decay , set between the series one episodes of Torchwood , were published in January 2007 . These novels expand on the difficult period in Gwen and Rhys ' relationship . In Border Princes she engages in an affair with the mysterious James Mayer , while Rhys is endangering himself for her in Slow Decay by taking an alien diet pill to impress her . Published in March 2008 , and tying in with the concurrently airing second series of Torchwood , Gwen appears in the novels Trace Memory , The Twilight Streets , and Something in the Water . Gwen 's first day with Andy Davidson as her beat partner is portrayed in a flashback in Trace Memory . In The Twilight Streets an alternate-future Torchwood is depicted ; headed by Gwen and Rhys , after the demise of Tosh , Owen , Ianto and Jack . Three more Torchwood books were released in October 2008 : Pack Animals , SkyPoint , and Almost Perfect . These novels maintain the series chronology : Pack Animals depicts Gwen attempting to plan for her wedding alongside her Torchwood mission . SkyPoint , in which Gwen and Rhys discover an alien threat whilst flathunting , is set soon after their wedding in \" Something Borrowed \" . Gwen 's continued use of her maiden name is not specifically addressed in the TV show , but SkyPoint sees her consciously reject the name \" Mrs Williams \" , after the unfamiliarity and awkwardness of hearing Jack address her this way . The novel Almost Perfect is the first to be set after the episode Exit Wounds in which Tosh and Owen are killed ; Gwen becomes concerned at Rhys ' increasing role in her investigations . The May 2009 wave of books consisted of Into the Silence , Bay of the Dead , and The House that Jack Built . Later novels published in October 2009 include Risk Assessment , The Undertaker 's Gift , and Consequences , all set between \" Exit Wounds \" and Children of Earth . Gwen appears in three Torchwood : Miracle Day prequel novels released in Summer 2011 . In First Born Gwen and Rhys encounter sinister forces in rural Wales whilst adjusting to parenthood and life in hiding . Gwen appears briefly in flashback material in Long Time Dead and The Men Who Sold the World , novels which explore the aftermath of the destruction of Torchwood 's headquarters and the technology left behind . Written by John and Carole Barrowman and published in September 2012 , the novel Exodus Code unites Gwen and Jack in a transatlantic mission following the events of Miracle Day . First published in January 2008 , the monthly Torchwood Magazine included Torchwood comic strips in which Gwen appeared . Gareth David-Lloyd 's comic , \" Shrouded \" , includes a scene set after Children in Earth , which shows Gwen cradling her young child . As Gwen is busy , Rhys is required to team up with Captain John Hart to save the timeline . During series two , the Torchwood website hosted an interactive online game written by series writer Phil Ford . Eve Myles makes a brief appearance as Gwen towards the end of the game , alongside Gareth David-Lloyd , when her character and Ianto shut down a broadcast from the fictitious Dark Talk studio . Throughout both series one and two , the interactive websites co-written by James Goss featured electronic literature content ( such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters ) which depict aspects of Gwen and the other Torchwood characters ' work and personal lives . The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell \u2014 an insider 's look into Torchwood \u2014 collects much of this ancillary online literature in hardback form , along with new material , some of which expands on Gwen 's background and life before Torchwood . Details are given of Gwen 's university attendance , a previous boyfriend named Bruce , and her time with Andy in the police force . Photographs are provided of Gwen and Rhys , which were used as set dressing in the TV series , and fictitious in-universe documents such as Gwen 's personnel form and her Torchwood case reports . In a similar vein to The Torchwood Archives , from a real-world perspective , Gary Russell 's The Torchwood Encyclopedia ( 2009 ) expands on \" every fact and figure \" for Gwen and the Torchwood world . = = = Audio drama = = = Gwen appeared in four original Torchwood audiobooks from BBC Books in 2008 which tied in with the second series of the television drama . The first of these \u2014 Hidden and Everyone Says Hello , narrated by Naoko Mori and Burn Gorman respectively \u2014 were released in February whilst two further releases \u2014 In the Shadows , narrated by Gwen 's portrayer Eve Myles , and The Sin Eaters , narrated by Gareth David-Lloyd \u2014 were released in September . Two additional original audiobooks set following the events of the second series \u2014 Ghost Train and Department X \u2014 were published in March 2011 and narrated by Kai Owen . In Ghost Train Gwen is killed : as Jack is missing Rhys has to work alone to reverse his wife 's fate . Gwen 's investigations after Miracle Day are depicted in 2012 audio books . In Army of One , released in March , written by Ian Edginton and narrated by Kai Owen , Gwen and Rhys are drawn into the investigation of an alien serial killer in Washington DC . In Fallout , released April , written by David Llewellyn and read by Tom Price , Andy has an extraterrestrial investigation of his own in the UK and requires assistance from Gwen by telephone . In May 's release , Red Skies written by Joseph Lidster and narrated by John Telfer , Jack has a premonition that Gwen has been ostensibly shot in the chest . However , in the following installment , Mr Invincible , a brief appearance from Rhys and Gwen reveal that the characters have returned to Wales safely following their time in the United States . Joseph Lidster wrote a Torchwood radio drama , \" Lost Souls \" , which aired in September 2008 as a Radio 4 Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman , Eve Myles , Gareth David-Lloyd and Freema Agyeman ( Martha ) . Set after the events of the 2008 series , Gwen and the team make their first international adventure in CERN in Geneva , as part of Radio 4 's special celebration of the switching on of the Large Hadron Collider . The special radio episode 's plot focuses both on the Large Hadron Collider 's activation and the doomsday scenario some warned it might cause , and the team 's mourning of Toshiko and Owen 's recent deaths . Between 1 and 3 July 2009 , Radio 4 aired three further audio dramas in the Afternoon Play time-slot , titled \" Asylum \" , \" Golden Age \" and \" The Dead Line \" , bridging the gap between Series 2 and 3 . \" The Dead Line \" depicts Gwen working together with Rhys to investigate a mysterious case ; she identifies him as a member of Torchwood during the mission . To tie in with the show 's fourth series , Torchwood : Miracle Day , the BBC produced three more radio plays , airing between 11 and 13 July 2011 . Titled \" The Devil and Miss Carew \" , \" Submission \" and \" House of the Dead \" , these plays fill narrative gaps between \" Exit Wounds \" and Miracle Day and feature the voices of Myles , Barrowman and David-Lloyd . In 2015 Myles will reprise the role of Gwen in a series of full cast audio dramas as part of an ongoing Torchwood series from Big Finish Productions . The third release of the series , Forgotten Lives , co-stars Kai Owen as Rhys and re-introduces the characters four years after the events of Miracle Day . = = Casting and initial characterisation = = Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies initially had the idea of an unnamed policewoman stumbling across a team of alien investigators in an alley as a premise , before Torchwood or the 2005 revival of Doctor Who were commissioned . Having been enamoured by her television performances , most notably in the 2005 episode of Doctor Who in which she guest-starred , Davies wrote the character of Gwen specifically for Eve Myles . Myles stated that having the part written for her was like her \" own personal Oscar \" . Part of the attraction of playing Gwen for Myles was that she had the opportunity to play an action hero with her own accent . Speaking on the casting of Welsh actors on Torchwood , Davies commented that it was deliberately intended , to make the Welsh accent mainstream , \" to make it as acceptable as Scottish or Irish \" . In an analysis of Welsh mythology in Torchwood , Lynette Porter observes that Gwen 's national consciousness forms part of her characterisation : her knowledge of local myths \" highlights her Welsh heritage and common knowledge from her experience and formal education . \" Discussing the international co-production behind series four , executive producer Julie Gardner commented that Myles ' continued involvement helped ensure that the \" flavour of Wales \" remained evident . In the first series of Torchwood , Gwen functioned as an audience surrogate . Russell T Davies likened her character type to that of 2005 \u2013 06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) : \" She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal . \" Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman , who at the same time embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype . Her distinct role within the team stems from the fact that \" she 's there for the people \" , who she feels \" instinctive and passionate \" about . Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more \" human empathy \" than the more mercenary members of the team , who are seen to be \" technology-and-alien-obsessed \" . In this vein , lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a \" little bit of soul \" back to Jack . Describing the ways in which Gwen 's methods differ from the rest of the team , Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job : \" she deals with the families , she deals with profiling , she deals with searching people 's backgrounds . It 's a new way of working she brings in \" . Myles stated that Gwen would have made a \" fantastic policewoman \" prior to joining Torchwood , drawing on the character 's ability to get vulnerable characters to \" open up by making them feel comfortable \" . Myles perceived Gwen to be \" the heart and emotion of Torchwood \" , and \" Torchwood 's social worker \" who can \" run and fight and stand in her own corner and win \" . Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity , Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her , just as she needs them . Gwen 's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one , as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman . Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood , and Myles feels his later appearances \" takes you right back to the beginning , it reminds you where she came from , how Jack found Gwen \" . Myles observed that Gwen 's many facets prevent her from getting bored ; she feels constantly challenged \" physically \" , \" mentally \" and \" morally \" through portraying the character . Eve Myles previously appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \" The Unquiet Dead \" as Gwyneth , a 19th-century clairvoyant . Gwyneth had a connection to the Cardiff Rift , which later became a central plot device in Torchwood . In response to questions about the similarity of the characters ' names , Russell T Davies denied they were connected , stating they are \" just two names beginning with \" G \" . \" Subsequently however , Davies ' 2008 Doctor Who episode \" Journey 's End \" alluded to a familial relationship between the characters ( with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was ) , explaining their physical resemblance as the result of \" spatial genetic multiplicity \" . Eve Myles said of the two characters , \" it was never on the cards as such , but something in the back of my head always said that they were going to be connected somehow . \" Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal , stating that \" It 's not familial as we understand it \" instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as \" an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift . \" = = Development = = = = = Morality = = = Despite being promoted as the show 's heart and moral conscience , the flaws in Gwen 's own morality are explored throughout the series ; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish . The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper . Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode \" Countrycide \" was deliberately structured in order to make the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life . For Davies , the dalliance is a \" human \" one , told in an adult manner characterised by \" lust and anger and hurt and the joy you get out of the initial stages of having an affair \" . Myles commented that Gwen 's compromised morality , as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience , and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were \" safe \" from temptation . Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen 's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character . Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate , Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a \" one-dimensional paragon of virtue \" . Instead , the writers made Gwen more \" realistic \" by giving her \" distinct human failings \" , which Walker felt made her \" arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars \" . He identified these failures as her \" tendency towards egotism \" , \" self-righteousness \" , and \" selfishness \" , evident in her \" highly questionable treatment \" of boyfriend Rhys Williams . Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example , as well as the scene in \" Combat \" where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won 't remember . Linnie Blake felt that Gwen 's had a passive role in her own affair ; as with her lesbian clinch with an alien and her forceable impregnation ; she argues that the Gothic situations in Torchwood continually parallels in the \" invasion \" of her sexuality . Valerie Estelle Frankel argued that Gwen finds \" the missing side of herself \" with her immersion into the world of Torchwood , represented by \" affairs and homosexuality and the threat of death \" rather than her ordinary domestic life with Rhys . Daniel Rawcliffe noted that Indira Varma 's character Suzie , featured in the premiere episode and in \" They Keep Killing Suzie \" , is used as a \" doppelg\u00e4nger \" for Gwen , ( a trope of Gothic fiction \u2013 compare with the terms \" Gothic double \" and literary foil ) . Suzie 's actions , and parallels with Gwen , help to illuminate some of Gwen 's own ethically ambiguous decisions in the first series . Gwen must constantly fight against Suzie , and Suzie 's example , \" if she is to be proved worthy of working alongside Captain Jack \" . According to Frankel Gwen 's confrontation with Suzie mirrored her confrontation with her \" inner self \" ; her literal journey into death gave her \" the wisdom and duality of both worlds , life and death , mundane and magical \" and allowed her to become stronger . Whilst Lynette Porter thought that Gwen became a \" fallen woman \" through her affair with Owen , she observed that this made Gwen 's role in relation to Jack in \" End of Days \" , analogous to that of Mary Magdalene to Jesus , reinforcing a prevalent biblical subtext . Gwen keeps a vigil at Jack 's \" Torchwood tomb \" and like Magdalene is rewarded for her loyalty by being the first to lay eyes upon the risen saviour . Valerie Frankel surmised that \" Gwen 's journey is one we all face [ ... ] she discovers the dominant intuition within , and then embraces it within the darkest caves of her inner self \" . David Cornelius stated that Gwen 's Torchwood adventures take her to the brink , and additionally show \" she 's strong enough to pull herself back \" . Stephen James Walker also felt that Gwen is still a redeemable character because she recognises her own moral failings , as seen in \" Combat \" where she sits alone sobbing over pizza , before picking herself up and trying to do better in the future . On this track , Torchwood actor Kai Owen justified Gwen 's treatment of Rhys in her darkest moments by arguing that Gwen 's intentions always remained pure , no matter how badly she treated Rhys . Ahead of the fourth series , Russell T Davies acknowledged that the character of Gwen can be both loved and hated by the audience . He stated that as an actress Myles isn 't preoccupied with her character being presented in a sympathetic light , being able \" to take that extraordinary deep breath and not care \" . io9 's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the TV episode \" The Categories of Life \" , written by Jane Espenson , exposed the character 's \" human vanity \" by showing that she has \" started to believe her own hype \" . In Anders ' eyes , the character is responsible for her father 's second heart attack because of her rash actions . Anders felt that later episodes in the fourth series continued to illuminate flaws in Gwen 's character , describing her as someone with an \" addictive personality \" who \" treats her Torchwood adventures like a drug that she craves \" though she knows they \" ruin her relationships with her husband and child \" . = = = Rhys and Jack = = = Much of Gwen 's characterisation centers on her developing relationship with her partner Rhys . Eve Myles describes the character as Gwen 's \" normality base \" . The relationship is tested by Gwen 's affair with colleague Owen Harper ( Gorman ) , a betrayal which Myles believes to be \" completely out of character \" for Gwen , explaining that the guilt experienced over her actions tears her to pieces . The production team had originally planned for Rhys to die in the first series but he was given a reprieve . Producer Richard Stokes explains that Rhys ' presence keeps Gwen from losing her \" heart \" and that without him \" it simply becomes a sci-fi show about sci-fi people , running around and hunting aliens \" . Julie Gardner adds that in the discussion , the writers had felt they could not have written Gwen as ever recovering from Rhys ' loss , and so chose not to kill off the character . In his analysis of Gwen , Daniel Rawcliffe opines that Rhys helps to keep her mental health intact , and argues that his presence prevents her from undergoing the same psychological deterioration as Suzie . Despite her ongoing relationship with Rhys , the series explores possibilities of a romantic connection between Gwen and her boss Jack . In a 2007 interview , Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a \" palpable love \" and stated that \" it 's the real thing and they 're going to make you wait for that . \" AfterElton 's Locksley Hall interprets Jack 's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by \" her warmth , her sense of justice , her very ordinariness and lack of glamour \" , whilst Myles states of Gwen 's interest in Jack that \" the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him \" . Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode \" Ghost Machine \" as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement . Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and \" fights every day to be with [ Rhys ] \" even though Jack remains \" a huge temptation \" . Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme ; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between \" Rhys , the sweet , kind handsome prince , and Jack , the compelling trickster \" . She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of \" steady prince \" for Gwen . John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her \" he 'd have to commit completely \" ; this is why he does not act on his feelings , because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people , he could \" never afford to do anything more \" . Stephen James Walker feels that Gwen 's decision not to wipe Rhys ' memory a second time in the episode \" Meat \" marks the end of any potential relationship between Gwen and Jack . As Davies felt it was essential that Rhys became enlightened to Gwen 's true occupation , the episode \" Meat \" focused on Rhys discovering and coming to terms with Torchwood . Richard Edwards of SFX magazine comments that this development allows their relationship to become the most convincing on the show and makes it clear why Gwen would want to marry him . Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy comments that overall , the relationship serves to create \" a nice contrast with the fantastical elements of the show \" ; whilst Jason Hughes opines that their marriage is \" handled in a painfully honest way \" and serves as \" a true definition of ' love ' written with subtlety and perfection \" . When asked about her character 's complex relationship with both Jack and Rhys , Myles explains that Gwen wouldn 't be as much of a \" strong character \" without her ordinary life with Rhys . Davies felt that the relationship furthered the shows exploration of human sexuality stating that \" open sexuality has to include everything \" including \" a husband / wife great big crime-fighting team ... happily in love \" . In 2009 Myles stated that to have Jack and Gwen act on their feelings would be \" like feeding the baby when it 's not hungry \" . Reinforcing this view , Julie Gardner feels the love between Gwen and Jack to be self-evident and that it did not need to be spoken . Lynette Porter argues that Gwen 's apotheosis of Jack causes him to flee Earth , as hero is a role he cannot play because he feels responsible for the deaths of those he loved . A press release ahead of the 2011 series stated that though Gwen retreats to a rural idyll with her family , she still retains feelings for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led alongside him . Ahead of the fourth series Myles explains that Gwen and Jack 's relationship is a \" love-hate-love relationship \" , which she believes to be reminiscent of , concurrently , a sibling relationship , a husband and wife relationship and \" the best friendship known to mankind \" . Myles feels that Gwen is not complete without Jack and that they are like \" two missing parts of a jigsaw \" and because the relationship works on so many different levels it cannot be labelled . Episode seven of Miracle Day features a scene where Gwen states that she would have Jack killed to save her daughter . Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters ' differing needs means that they inevitably \" clash like steel blades \" . = = = Action hero and mother = = = Original lead writer Chris Chibnall feels Gwen develops into a stronger character between series one and series two , becoming less \" wide-eyed \" over events happening around her . Frankel writes that \" she is a whole woman now , integrated with all the parts of herself \" . In the second series , Eve Myles states , Gwen now \" knows where her feet are \" . Costume Designer Ray Holman explains that these developments are reflected in how the production team dresses the character . In the first series Gwen is dressed in a \" faded high street look \" and keeps away from leather clothing . As she becomes more confident in her new vocation , her clothes becomes \" a lot more designer and heroic looking \" . In the second series she wears more leather from brands such as Diesel and G-star which Holman describes as \" sexy \" and \" practical \" . The overall effect is that Gwen 's leathers \" toughen her up a bit , but keep her stylish at the same time \" . For fourth series Miracle Day , costume designer Shawna Trpcic declared her intention to take Eve Myles \" out of the nunnery \" . Myles recalled vetoing a brassiere she was asked to wear because she felt it to be unnecessarily sexualised and impractical for action sequences . She added that she views Gwen as \" a real woman \" and \" not about tits and arse \" . Children of Earth director Euros Lyn remarks that by the third series Gwen has grown so that \" she now is on a par with Jack , in terms of having the knowledge and the experience to make decisions and to be a heroine \" . Daniel Martin of The Guardian opines that her characterisation in the serial \" shows just how far she 's come \" , whilst Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times feels that she is a \" soulful leather-jacketed action heroine \" . Myles states that Gwen becomes a harsher character , but she feels that , \" if she wasn 't , people would die \" . David Cornelius observes that Gwen is no longer the kind-hearted outsider she was when she first joined Torchwood . By Children of Earth she has become \" colder and much more aggressive \" . Her horrific experiences turn her into \" a biting cynic \" ; when both government and army betray the British people , Gwen claims to understand finally why the Doctor does not save humanity from world crises . She believes he \" must look at this planet and turn away in shame \" . A press release stated that Miracle Day had Gwen \" make the most terrible decisions , on behalf of all mankind \" . This is evident in \" The Blood Line \" , where her character is shown to be willing to sacrifice the entire Torchwood team , in addition to her dying father , for the good of the world . Commenting on Gwen 's characterisation in this episode , Dan Martin notes that \" Gwen sees transition into the Earth Mothering Tank Girl become complete , as she plays God and appears to love it . \" Press releases describe Gwen in light of contradictions between her heroic and conventionally feminine roles in the series ; despite becoming a \" tough , ruthless warrior , who loves the thrill of the fight \" Gwen remains a \" funny , salty , earthy woman who loves home and family \" . Children of Earth sees Gwen become pregnant by husband Rhys ; a storyline which IGN writer Asham Haque thought provided \" one of the few hope-giving threads \" in the serial . She gives birth to a baby girl , Anwen , between the third and fourth series . Both Eve Myles and creator Russell T Davies have described this plot development as emblematic of a contradiction at the heart of Gwen 's character . Myles , believing that motherhood gives Gwen a greater sense of responsibility , says it makes Gwen \" even more human , and yet even more of a wonder woman \" . Whilst talking about the show 's fourth series , Davies suggested that it would be \" irresistible \" to use the image of \" Gwen Cooper with baby in one arm and gun in the other \" as promotion . The production team have continued to emphasise this contradictory aspect to Gwen 's character , which has proved popular with critics and viewers . For example , a promotional clip for Miracle Day features Gwen firing from her gun in one hand while protectively holding her baby in the other . Zap2it 's Mikey O 'Connell praised this as one of the trailer 's best aspects , praising Gwen as \" the coolest mum ever . \" Reviewing the opening episodes of Miracle Day Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times identified \" the dark humor \" of the sequence as representative of \" the top notes of the British Torchwood \" . The Daily Telegraph 's Catherine Gee praised the dichotomy between the character 's two roles , stating that \" Eve Myles 's homely yet badass agent is incredibly charming \" . Critics have drawn comparisons with famous screen action heroines such as Ellen Ripley , portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien trilogy . Ripley is seen as a ground-breaking depiction of a heroine , whose heroism is neither derived from male support nor hampered by femininity . Rawcliffe writes that Gwen 's strength of character makes her a \" half Ripley \" , insofar as she possesses all of Ripley 's strength , and yet \" is hampered by her reliance on the male characters of Jack , Rhys and Owen \" . Gwen has been compared , at least superficially , to Buffy Summers , as portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar . Reflecting on a scene from Miracle Day , one critic comments that Gwen is \" channeling Season Two Buffy the Vampire Slayer \" when she shoots at a helicopter from her bazooka ( recalling the sequence depicted in Buffy episode \" Innocence \" ) . Gwen has attracted implicit comparisons with Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider video game and film franchise . Commenting on the first episode of Torchwood : Miracle Day Den of Geek 's Simon Brew states that \" whoever Hollywood producers cast in the planned reboot of the Tomb Raider movie franchise , I 'm fully confident that Myles could kick their ass . Twice . Before breakfast . \" While critical of the typical portrayal of British female science fiction characters , The Guardian 's Krystina Nellis singles out Gwen and Doctor Who 's River Song ( Alex Kingston ) as positive depictions of strong female characters , stating , \" It 'd be difficult to find two superwomen in less need of a man to save them . \" = = Reception = = Eve Myles has enjoyed an increased profile since being cast as Gwen Cooper in Torchwood and is now considered one of Wales ' greatest drama exports . On casting her , Russell T Davies described Myles as \" Wales best kept secret , \" and the actress has been described as a \" Welsh icon \" since appearing in Torchwood , with the Western Mail listing Myles ' turn as \" Torchwood 's feisty female lead \" as a contributing factor in making her one of Wales ' sexiest women , as well as a national institution . In an analysis of Welsh representation in television , Geraint Telfan Davies cited Myles ' role in Torchwood , coupled with the popularity of sitcom Gavin and Stacey , as combating prejudice against the Welsh accent . Backing up this claim , Samantha Bennet of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette describes Myles ' \" silvery , flowing \" accent as \" exotic \" and Myles herself as a bona fide star . Shortly after Torchwood 's premiere , Conservative MP Michael Gove described Gwen Cooper as a \" Celtic Rosselini \" and an example of Welsh sensuality , while in 2006 , Wales on Sunday named Myles as its \" Bachelorette of the Year \" . In July 2011 , The Scotsman 's Aidan Smith described Gwen Cooper as \" the sexiest woman in Wales \" . The Guardian 's \" Organ Grinder \" reviewer was full of praise for Myles ' performance in \" Everything Changes \" , expressing the opinion that , through her portrayal of Gwen Cooper , she managed to outshine Captain Jack . The character was described by The Stage as \" the solid , down to earth character needed to anchor Torchwood to the real world \" whilst functioning well as a foil to Captain Jack . Some reviews mocked the prosaic characterisation . Verity Stob , a technology columnist for online newspaper The Register , wrote a parody of Torchwood called Under Torch Wood ( in the style of Dylan Thomas ' Under Milk Wood ) . The piece mocks Gwen 's role as \" the viewer proxy \" describing her as \" plumply pop-eyed \" and her boyfriend Rhys as ' Barry Backstory ' . Jan Ravens played a parody version of Gwen in the impressionist television series Dead Ringers , in which she displays a badge labelling her with what Jon Culshaw 's Captain Jack describes as her sole characteristic : Welsh . In November 2006 Jim Shelley from The Mirror stated Gwen to be \" neither as interesting nor as sexy as she should be . \" A plot development that saw Gwen respond to the advances of an alien sex-gas in another woman 's body was descrived by Karman Kregloe of AfterEllen as characterising \" nearly every negative lesbian stereotype imaginable \" . Kregloe considers Gwen 's inability to satiate the alien as a \" play on a traditional , sexist social construct \" , and the fact that Gwen never again mentions this experience is also criticised . The more assertive Gwen in Torchwood 's third series attracted praise from reviewers : Paul Collins of Total Sci-Fi expressed the opinion that Children of Earth finally shows Gwen 's heroic characteristics in a way that had been missing in the first two series , while Daniel Martin from the Guardian stated that \" it 's great to see Gwen being so completely badass \" . David Cornelius wrote that Gwen succeeds as a strongly written female character that does not pander to stereotypes because writers avoid defining her by any aspect of her adventures . Reviewers commented on Myles ' standing as a leading lady : Comic Book Resources ' Remy Minnick describes Gwen as \" the true heart of Torchwood \" , while Scott Lewinski from Wired magazine described Myles ' portrayal as the conscience of the Torchwood team , and the show itself . Total Sci-Fi 's Jonathan Wilkins felt that the five part serial marked the emergence of Eve Myles as a star in her own right and opined that she could potentially carry the show without co-star Barrowman . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune stated her belief that the third series ' climax showed that Eve Myles has \" grown into the role \" of Gwen , describing her performance as \" outstanding \" . Ryan later gave an \" Honourable Mention \" to Gwen when discussing Sci-Fi TV 's Most Memorable Female Characters , making her the only Doctor Who franchise character to receive a mention . Critical response to the character remained positive in the fourth series . Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph felt Myles \" took the acting honours with a bravura performance \" , whilst Charlie Jane Anders stated Gwen to have the strongest moments in the finale which led to \" a new appreciation for her character \" . Eve Myles won the 2007 Bafta Cymru Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Gwen Cooper , winning over the parent series ' actress Billie Piper . She was nominated again for the award in 2008 , and again in 2010 . In 2010 Myles won the ' Best Actress \" award in the SFX Reader 's Awards poll , and was crowned best actress in the 11th annual Airlock Alpha Portal Awards .

                    "text": "Smallville = Smallville is an American television series developed by writer-producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar , based on the DC Comics character Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster . The series , initially broadcast by The WB , premiered on October 16 , 2001 . After Smallville 's fifth season , The WB and UPN merged to form The CW , the series ' later United States broadcaster . Smallville , which ended its tenth and final season on May 13 , 2011 , follows Clark Kent ( Tom Welling ) in the fictional town of Smallville , Kansas , before he becomes known as Superman . The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school . After season five Smallville ventures into adult settings , eventually focusing on his career at the Daily Planet and introducing other DC comic-book superheroes and villains . Before the series ' production Bruce Wayne , chronicling the young protagonist 's journey toward Batman , was proposed ; although that series failed to generate interest , it inspired Smallville . Series developers Gough and Millar pitched their \" no tights , no flights \" rule to the president of Warner Bros. Television , reducing Superman to the bare essentials and examining what led Clark Kent to become the Man of Steel . After seven seasons with the show , Gough and Millar departed with little explanation . Smallville was primarily filmed in and around Vancouver , British Columbia , with local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations . Most of the music for the first six seasons was composed by Mark Snow , who incorporated elements of John Williams 's musical score from the Superman film series . In season seven , Louis Febre ( who worked with Snow from the beginning ) became the series ' primary composer . Smallville was generally positively received when it began . Former Superman star Christopher Reeve expressed approval for the series , making two guest appearances before his death . The pilot episode set a ratings record for a WB debut , with 8.4 million viewers . Over ten seasons the series averaged about 4.34 million viewers per episode , with season two the highest-rated at 6.3 million . By the end of its run , Smallville passed Stargate SG-1 as the longest-running North American science-fiction series . Since its first season , the series received accolades ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards . Smallville spawned a series of young-adult novels , a DC Comics bimonthly comic book , soundtrack recordings and series-related merchandise . All ten seasons are available on DVD in regions 1 , 2 and 4 . In April 2012 , it continued in comic-book form with a storyline resuming shortly after the series finale , and ended in November 2014 . = = Series overview = = The regular cast is introduced in season one , with storylines involving a villain deriving power from kryptonite exposure . The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar . Smallville 's first season primarily dealt with Clark 's coming to terms with his alien origin and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was connected to the death of Lana Lang 's parents . After the first season the series had fewer villain-of-the-week episodes , focusing instead on individual-character story arcs and exploring Clark 's origins . Major storylines include Clark 's discovery of his Kryptonian heritage and Lex 's escalating conflict with his father , Lionel . The disembodied voice of Clark 's father , Jor-El , is introduced ; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship , setting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark 's earthly destiny . In a fourth-season arc Clark , instructed by Jor-El , searches for three Kryptonian stones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude . Clark battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod , and must capture ( or destroy ) other escaped Phantom Zone criminals . His cousin Kara arrives , and Lex Luthor discovers Clark 's secret . The eighth season introduces Davis Bloome ( Smallville 's version of Doomsday ) , and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor . Justin Hartley becomes a series regular as Oliver Queen ( Green Arrow ) after being a recurring guest in season six . In the ninth season Major Zod ( Callum Blue ) and other members of Zod 's military group are revived ( without their Kryptonian powers ) by Tess Mercer , and their efforts to regain their powers are the season 's central conflict . The final season revolves around Clark 's attempts to lose his doubts and fears and become the hero he is meant to be , while confronting his biggest challenges : the coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor . = = Cast = = Tom Welling plays Clark Kent , a young man with superhuman abilities who tries to find his place in life after discovering that he is an alien and uses his powers to help those in danger . Clark 's season-one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a normal life . After months of scouting , Welling was cast as Clark . Although David Nutter had to convince his manager that the role would not hurt the actor 's film career to persuade Welling to read the pilot script , after reading the script Welling agreed to audition . Kristin Kreuk plays Lana Lang , the girl next door . Grieving the loss of her parents , she has empathy for everyone and feels connected to Clark . Kreuk was the first to be cast , after Nutter saw an audition tape the actress had sent . Although she left the series after the seventh season , she returned for five episodes in season eight as a guest star . Michael Rosenbaum plays Lex Luthor , a billionaire 's son sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant . After Clark saves his life , they become fast friends . As the series progresses , Lex 's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies . The role was difficult to cast ; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and , feeling that he did not take his first audition seriously enough , outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny , charismatic or menacing . His second audition went so well that he was hired . Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons , reprising his role for the series finale . Allison Mack plays Chloe Sullivan , one of Clark 's best friends , who is in love with him ( although her feelings are not reciprocated ) . Editor of the school newspaper , her journalistic curiosity and desire to \" expose falsehoods \" and \" know the truth \" create tension with her friends ( especially when she investigates Clark 's past ) . After learning about Smallville from casting director Dee Dee Bradley , Mack considered auditioning for Lana Lang but auditioned twice for Chloe Sullivan . The character was created just for the series , and was intended to have an \" ethnic background \" before Mack was hired . She has since appeared in the comic book . Sam Jones III plays Pete Ross , another best friend of Clark 's and the first person to whom Clark voluntarily tells his secret . Although he is in love with Chloe , he does not admit it because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love triangle already in place . Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three , but made a guest appearance in season seven . Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast , with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot . In the comics Ross is Caucasian , but the producers chose to cast Jones ( who is African-American ) . Annette O 'Toole plays Martha Kent , Clark 's adoptive mother . She and her husband , Jonathan , give Clark wise advice about coping with his increasing abilities . In season five Martha takes a state-senate seat , and in season six she leaves the show . Although Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent , during filming everyone ( including Ettinger ) realized that she was not right for the part . O 'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot . Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent The Huntress was canceled , allowing O 'Toole to join the cast . The actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III . John Schneider plays Jonathan Kent , Clark 's adoptive father , who goes to great lengths to protect his son 's secret ; according to Schneider , Jonathan is \" perfectly willing to go to jail , or worse , to protect his son . \" Schneider was written out of the show in the series ' 100th episode , with Jonathan dying of a heart attack the night of his election victory . Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for Smallville ; they were happy to cast Schneider as Jonathan because he was known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard , which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm . Eric Johnson plays Whitney Fordman , Lana 's boyfriend in season one , who becomes jealous of Clark and Lana 's budding friendship and hazes him . He reconciles with Clark before joining the Marines and going to Afghanistan . Although Whitney was written out of the show in the first-season finale , he made cameo appearances in the season-two episode \" Visage \" ( where it is disclosed that he was killed in action ) and the season-four episode \" Fa\u00e7ade \" ( during a flashback to Clark 's freshman year of high school ) . Johnson , who auditioned for Lex and Clark before he was cast as Whitney , was pleased that the writers gave his character a hero 's exit . John Glover plays Lionel Luthor , Lex 's father . Lionel is responsible for the Kents ' adoption of Clark without legal ramifications or questions about his origins . Glover tried to make Lionel seem to try to \" toughen [ Lex ] up \" , and saw the character as a rich , powerful businessman who was disappointed in his son . Lionel was created for Smallville to parallel the Kents and as an \" experiment in extreme parenting . \" A recurring first-season guest , Glover became a series regular from seasons two to seven until Lionel was murdered by Lex near the end of the seventh season . Lionel returns in a parallel-universe version , also portrayed by Glover , during the final season in a recurring role . Jensen Ackles plays Jason Teague , Lana 's love interest , in season four . He follows Lana to Smallville from Paris , taking a job as the school 's assistant football coach , but is fired when their relationship comes to light . By the end of the season , it is disclosed that he was working with his mother to track the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge . Before he was cast as Jason , Ackles was second in line for the role of Clark Kent . Although he received top billing for season four and was contracted for season five , he was written out of the show in the season-four finale because of his commitment to Supernatural . Erica Durance plays Lois Lane , Chloe 's cousin who comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe 's supposed death and stays with the Kents . Durance , a recurring guest in season four , became a series regular . The producers wanted to bring Lois Lane to the series , and Chloe 's supposed death in the season-three finale provided the opportunity . Durance was cast three days before filming began ; although she could initially appear in only four episodes , according to the film division of Warner Bros. , after negotiations her character was cleared for more appearances . Aaron Ashmore plays Jimmy Olsen , Chloe 's photographer boyfriend who works at the Daily Planet . Ashmore , a recurring guest in season six , became a regular cast member in season seven . He called his casting a welcome surprise : \" I auditioned for [ the role ] and I put myself on tape . I hadn 't heard anything , and a couple of weeks later , all of the sudden ( sic ) , I got the call saying , ' You 're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville . ' It 's a dream come true , really . \" After three seasons on the series ( two as a regular ) , Ashmore 's character was killed off . Although Ashmore 's Jimmy Olsen was murdered , he said his character was not the \" real \" Jimmy Olsen ; Jimmy 's younger brother , who appears briefly in the season-eight finale , is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois . Ashmore returns as the real , younger Jimmy in the series finale . Laura Vandervoort plays Kara , Clark 's Kryptonian cousin . Sent to look after Kal-El ( Clark ) , she was in suspended animation for eighteen years . When the dam confining Kara 's ship broke in the season-six finale , \" Phantom \" , she was set free . She has Clark 's abilities , including flight . At the end of the seventh season , Kara was trapped in the Phantom Zone . Although Vandervoort did not return regularly for the eighth season , she had guest appearances to wrap up her storyline in season eight 's \" Bloodline \" and season ten 's \" Supergirl \" and \" Prophecy \" . Justin Hartley plays Oliver Queen ( Green Arrow ) , the CEO of Queen Industries and leader of a small group of superheroes . Hartley , a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons , became a series regular in season eight and was the producers ' first choice to play Oliver Queen . He was designed to shake up Clark and Lois in season six and to give Clark an alternate view of how to fight crime . Samuel Witwer plays Davis Bloome in season eight . A \" charismatic \" paramedic struggling with inner darkness , Davis Bloome is Smallville 's version of Doomsday ( the only character to kill Superman ) . Davis would come to resemble his comic-book counterpart over the course of the season . Brian Peterson said that with Michael Rosenbaum 's departure , the new executive producers were looking for a villain \" as great as Lex \" and Doomsday fit the bill . Cassidy Freeman plays Tess Mercer , Lex 's handpicked successor as LuthorCorp CEO in season eight . Her name is an homage to two Superman characters , Eve Teschmacher and Mercy Graves . Freeman described her character as \" fierce \" , \" fun \" , and \" intelligent \" , with finding Lex her primary season-eight goal . Tess believes that Clark will be able to help her . In the season-ten episode \" Abandoned \" , it is disclosed that her birth name is Lutessa Lena Luthor and she is Lionel 's illegitimate daughter . Callum Blue plays Zod , an early version of the criminal from Krypton who was sent to the Phantom Zone prison . His character is first mentioned in season five , when Brainiac uses Lex 's body as a vessel for Zod 's spirit , and he appears in a Kryptonian sphere in the season-eight finale . Smallville 's executive producers called this incarnation \" Major Zod \" ( as opposed to the typical \" General Zod \" ) , and in season nine \" the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters \" . = = Production = = = = = Development = = = Tollin / Robbins Productions originally wanted to do a series about a young Bruce Wayne , but the feature-film division of Warner Bros. decided to develop an origin movie for Batman and did not want to compete with a television series . In 2000 Tollin / Robbins approached Peter Roth , president of Warner Bros. Television , about developing a series on a young Superman . That year , Alfred Gough and Miles Millar developed a pilot based on the film Eraser . After watching the pilot , Roth approached Gough and Millar about developing a pilot about a young Superman ; the two made a \" no tights , no flights \" rule that Clark would not fly or wear the Superman suit during the series . Gough and Millar wanted to strip Superman to his \" bare essence \" , exploring why Clark Kent became the Man of Steel . They felt that because they were not comic-book fans or familiar with the universe , they would have an unbiased approach to the series . Gough and Millar learned about the characters , researching the comics and choosing what they liked . They pitched their idea to The WB and Fox on the same day . A bidding war between the networks followed , with The WB committing to thirteen episodes . Although Roth , Gough and Millar knew the show would be action-oriented , they wanted to reach 7th Heaven 's \" middle America iconography \" . To create atmosphere , the team decided the meteor shower bringing Clark to Earth would be the ironic foundation of the show . The primary source of his life on Earth and the super-powered beings Clark must fight , it would take away the parents of the girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark path . Roth appreciated Clark 's conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so much pain . The creators also had to address why Lex Luthor would socialize with young people . They created a loneliness in the character which they felt would drive him to reach out to the teenagers , a loneliness echoed in Clark and Lana . Gough and Millar wanted a parallel to the Kents and created Lionel Luthor , Lex 's father , whom they saw as conducting an \" experiment in extreme parenting . \" They wanted a younger Kent couple , to be involved in Clark 's life and help him on his journey . Chloe Sullivan ( another character created for the series ) was considered the \" outsider \" the show needed to ensure that someone would notice the strange happenings in Smallville rather than a \" precursor to Lois Lane \" . Smallville has been described by Warner Bros. as a from-the-roots reinterpretation of Superman mythology . Since the November 2004 reacquisition of Superboy by the Siegel family , a copyright infringement dispute has arisen over ownership of the fictional town of Smallville and a claimed similarity between Superboy and Smallville 's Clark Kent . According to the Siegel heirs , \" Smallville is part of the Superboy copyright \" ( which they hold ) . = = = Crew changes = = = On April 3 , 2008 , after seven seasons with the series , Gough and Millar announced that they were leaving Smallville . The developers thanked the cast and crew for their work , acknowledging that they never stopped fighting for what they saw as \" their vision \" of the show . A reason for their departure was not provided . Gough and Millar were replaced as showrunners by Todd Slavkin , Darren Swimmer , Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson . All began writing for the series at the start of the second season , and were executive producers by the seventh season . On February 6 , 2009 , after one season , the L.A. Times confirmed that Swimmer and Slavkin would take over the new CW series Melrose Place and not return for Smallville 's ninth season ; Souders and Peterson would continue as showrunners . On July 24 , 2009 , it was reported Tom Welling was a co-executive producer of the series . On March 26 , 2010 , The Hollywood Reporter disclosed that Millar , Gough and co-producer Tollin / Robins Productions filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and The CW charging that Hollywood 's \" vertical integration \" cost Millar and Gough millions of dollars . The suit claimed that Warner Bros. failed to \" maximize profits \" in marketing Smallville , misrepresented production costs and sold the show to foreign markets at \" well below the value of the series \" , not specifying the amount of compensation sought by the plaintiffs . In a May 20 , 2010 press release from The CW , Tom Welling was appointed an executive producer for Smallville 's tenth season . = = = Filming = = = The series was produced at BB Studios in Burnaby , British Columbia . Although production was initially planned for Australia , Vancouver had more of a \" Middle America landscape \" . The city provided a site for the Kent farm , doubled for Metropolis , provided a cheaper shooting location and was in the Los Angeles time zone . Smallville 's Main Street is a combination of two locations in the town of Merritt and Cloverdale . Vancouver Technical School doubled as the exterior for Smallville High , since the school had the \" mid-American largess \" wanted by the filmmakers and was in keeping with Millar 's idea that Smallville should be the epitome of \" Smalltown , USA \" . Templeton Secondary School was used for Smallville High 's interior . During season one , the production team repainted most of Templeton in Smallville High 's red and yellow and distributed large Smallville High Crows logos ; so much of the school was painted that it adopted red and yellow as its school colors . The students became accustomed to the film crew ( which had to shoot when school was in session ) , and when a class was dismissed the crew stepped aside so the students could move the equipment to get to their lockers for the next class . The Kent farm is a working farm in Aldergrove . Owned by the Anderlinis , the crew painted their home yellow for the show . Exterior shots of Luthor Mansion were filmed at Hatley Castle in Victoria . The interiors were filmed at Shannon Mews in Vancouver , also the set for the Dark Angel pilot and the film Along Came a Spider . Clova Cinema , in Cloverdale was used for exteriors of the Talon , Smallville 's coffeehouse . The story is told from Clark 's point of view , so color schemes and camera selection illustrate how he interprets his environment . When he is safe at home , the colors are \" warm and gentle \" earth tones and the camera movement is \" very gentle \" . When Clark is keeping his secret and not in danger , the lighting is more neutral and the camera more mobile . When danger is present , the lighting becomes colder and the camera is handheld to allow for more \" extreme angles \" . In Metropolis \" clean , hard-lined architecture \" predominates , with blues , purples and reflective metals the dominant scheme . The same concept is used for the characters ; Lex usually has a \" glass , steel background \" , and Lionel has a white or \" clinical blue \" background . Lex typically wears black , grey and \" cool tones \" ( purples and blues ) . Clark is represented by red , yellow and blue , similar to the traditional Superman costume , and \" All-American \" red , white and blue . From season two onward , Entity FX produced all of the visual effects for Smallville , including the view of the Metropolis skyline . = = = Music = = = Composer Mark Snow worked with producer Ken Horton to create Smallville 's score . Snow composed music as he watched the picture , and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings . He then sent the music to the producers , who sent it back for recomposition if needed . Individual episodes have their own soundtrack , comprising one ( or more ) songs . Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack . Their choices were discussed by the producers , who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights . Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a \" typical action-adventure \" television show , \" the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional , orchestral approach to the score \" . The main Smallville theme was not composed by Snow , although he composed opening themes for other shows ( including The X-Files ) . The series ' opening music is \" Save Me \" by Remy Zero . Snow composed the closing-credits music , which was intended as Smallville 's theme . During the first two seasons , the closing-credits music was a potential theme for the series ( before \" Save Me \" was selected ) ; it was more \" heroic \" and \" in-your-face \" . Snow was told during season two that the closing credits needed new music , since the show had evolved and the existing music was no longer suitable , and he created a new , toned-down score with a more \" melodic \" sound . Snow has also reworked music from the previous Superman films . John Williams ' musical score for the Krypton sequence in the opening credits of Superman was used in season two 's \" Rosetta \" ( which featured a guest appearance by Christopher Reeve ) and several times in the season-two finale . To save money Snow recorded his version of Williams ' score , since using the original version would have required the team to pay Williams ' orchestra . In an interview with Randall Larson on May 23 , 2008 Snow said that he would not be returning to Smallville , citing the joint workload of Smallville and Ghost Whisperer , but would return for Ghost Whisperer . Reminiscing about his work on the show , Snow said that much of the music had not changed during the series and agreed with Larson that it was \" more [ about ] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes \" . Louis Febre , who worked closely with Snow from the beginning , became the sole composer for Smallville in season seven . Febre said that since he began composing for Smallville there was a shift to \" thematic development \" in the score , paralleling the characters ' growth : \" As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex , I found a need to comment musically on his growth , and as he drew closer to his Superman persona , it became obvious that a ' Superman ' theme would be required . \" The creative team had a number of opportunities to try different music to enhance an episode 's storyline . Pyken and Wade-Reed chose and coordinated music on the show when Snow and Febre 's scores were not used . In season three 's \" Slumber \" , producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a band to provide music for the entire episode . During a breakfast meeting with the music department of Warner Bros. R.E.M. was suggested , and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episode 's featured band with its story ( which revolved around REM sleep ) . That season , Al Gough wanted to use Johnny Cash 's cover of the Nine Inch Nails song \" Hurt \" for the final scene of \" Shattered \" ( when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a one-way mirror at Belle Reve sanitarium ) as soon as he read the episode 's script . Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to obtain the rights for the song and his heirs , believing that the song 's use in the episode would honor his memory , gave Smallville the rights . For season three 's \" Resurrection \" and \" Memoria \" , songs were chosen as symbolism for the characters . In \" Resurrection \" , The Rapture 's \" Infatuation \" was used during a scene with Lex and Lana to symbolize the question , \" Are we ever going to figure out what these two people think of each other ? \" For \" Memoria \" Gough wanted to use Evanescence 's \" My Immortal \" for the episode 's final scene , telling Wade-Reed that he saw the song as being about mothers . In that scene Clark tells Martha that his first childhood memory was of his mother , Lara . Season three 's \" Velocity \" provided the music editors with the opportunity to use hip-hop , rarely used in the series . The episode , similar to The Fast and the Furious , focused on Pete . Wade-Reed heard of British hip-hop artist Dizzee Rascal , and was the first person in the United States to secure the rights to Rascal 's album . Greg Beeman directs episodes , and sometimes scenes , with particular songs in mind . For \" Vortex \" in season two , he used Coldplay 's \" In My Place \" for the final scene . In the season-two finale \" Exodus \" , Beeman directed the scene where Lana shows up at the Kent barn before Lex 's wedding to Matthew Good 's \" Weapon \" . The lyrics speak of an angel and devil \" by my side \" , and Beeman timed specific shots to the song 's lyrics . = = Broadcasting = = Smallville premiered at 9 : 00 pm on Tuesday , October 16 , 2001 on The WB . For the next five seasons the series aired on The WB , moving from Tuesday at 9 : 00 pm to Wednesday at 8 : 00 pm and eventually to Thursday at 8 : 00 pm . In 2006 , before the start of Smallville 's sixth season , it was announced The WB and UPN would merge into The CW and the network reported that the series would continue in its lineup . During its seventh season , the series aired in Canada a day earlier than it did in the United States . On May 21 , 2009 it was announced that Smallville 's ninth season would move to Friday at 8 : 00 pm , considered the \" death slot \" for television programs . By the end of its tenth season it was the longest-running science-fiction TV show in the United States , breaking the record held by Stargate SG-1 . Syndication rights became available in 2011 , and TNT began airing episodes on October 3 , 2011 . = = = Reception = = = Smallville set a WB record as its highest-rated series debut , with 8.4 million viewers tuned in for the pilot . Its premiere set a WB record for adults aged 18 \u2013 34 and finished first among viewers aged 12 \u2013 34 , with Warner Bros. president Jordan Levin crediting the series with invigorating the network 's Tuesday-night lineup . Smallville appeared on the cover of Entertainment Weekly as one of five new shows to watch . After its first season , the series was sixth on the Parents Television Council 's 10-best list of broadcast programs . Levin , acknowledging early concerns that Smallville had become a villain of the week series , said that season two would introduce \" smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes \" and become less of a \" serialized show \" . According to Gough , although each succeeding season relied more on season-long story arcs , an occasional villain-of-the-week story was necessary . The villain-of-the-week stories were more harshly criticized by fans of the Superman mythology , but Gough wanted to please them and The WB 's general audience ( teenagers who preferred villain-of-the-week stories over episodes focusing on the Superman mythology ) . Christopher Reeve , star of the Superman films , expressed his approval of the show : I was a little bit skeptical when I heard about [ Smallville ] at first , but I must say the writing , the acting , and the special effects are quite remarkable . In 1977 , a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film \u2014 it 's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show . It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series . I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology , and Tom is doing a good job following the tradition . According to MTV 's Karl Heitmueller , Smallville 's Clark Kent was a better representation of the original material and remained \" true to the heart of the story \" by showing Clark 's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations . However , Heitmueller wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville ( including Lex Luthor ) recognized Clark when he put on the suit . TV Guide 's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television , but Christopher Hooton of Metro wrote that Smallville was a story which did not need to be told : \" No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne 's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman , so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay ? \" = = = Nielsen rankings = = = A table of season rankings , based on average total estimated viewers per episode , of Smallville on The WB and The CW follows . \" Rank \" is the series ' ratings compared to other prime time TV series . = = = Accolades = = = During its ten seasons , Smallville won awards ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards .

He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father , and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother .

The sparks make Chloe the desire of every man , but when they wear off an admirer kidnaps her and she is rescued by Clark . = = = = Comic books = = = = Smallville 's first venture into comics was \" Elemental \" , a one-off story by Gough and Millar which appeared in TV Guide during the series ' first season and set in that period . Before the start of season two , DC Comics published a one-off comic based on the series . Entitled Smallville : The Comic , it has two stories . The first , \" Raptor \" by Mark Verheiden and Roy Martinez , is about an abused boy who mutates into a raptor ( thanks to kryptonite ) and tries to get revenge on the Luthor family . Michael Green and John Paul Leon wrote \" Exile and The Kingdom \" , with insight into why Lex remains in Smallville after his father offers him a position in Metropolis at the end of season one . DC Comics then began publishing a bimonthly comic with stories about Smallville characters . Writer and script coordinator Clint Carpenter called the comic-book line a companion to the series rather than a non-canonical version . According to Carpenter , the comic-book line expands on events in the series ( such as season-ending cliffhangers ) and gives \" additional depth \" to characters with limited screen time on the series or whose storylines needed additional explanation . Carpenter was not the first person asked to oversee the comic ; Mark Verheiden , who co-wrote the one-off comic , was originally intended to be in charge of the bimonthly series . Verheiden 's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books , so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on . Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series , there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series . In one instance , the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs . The comic-book series tied into the TV series , the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages , with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes ' production . The comic-book series ended in January 2005 , with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut . Note : The full title of all volumes listed here start with \" Smallville : \" . = = = = Smallville Season Eleven = = = = On February 8 , 2012 , it was reported that a Smallville Season Eleven comic book would be published by DC Comics . The series would be released digitally first , and collected into a three-issue print edition once a month . The first digital issue was released on April 13 , 2012 , and the first print issue was published on May 2 , 2012 . In the comic book ( written by Smallville executive story editor Bryan Q. Miller ) , set six months after Darkseid 's attack , Clark no longer fights crime as \" The Blur \" but as \" Superman \" . Although Clark is generally accepted by the public , some distrust him ( including Lex Luthor , despite his memory loss after his encounter with Tess Mercer ) . TV Guide reported that \" Detective \" , a new series of adventures paralleling the TV series and the comic series ' second arc , would be published digitally on the title 's off-week beginning January 4 , 2013 . A new arc , \" Effigy \" , would feature a team-up of recurring character John Jones and Batman . DC Comics cancelled the series after nineteen issues at the end of the \" Olympus \" story arc , with the rest of the season-eleven story continuing as miniseries under the Season Eleven banner . On March 11 , 2015 , DC Comics ended the Smallville Season Eleven with story arc \" Continuity \" , which serves as the finale of the television franchise . = = = = = Main series = = = = = Note : The full title of all volumes listed here start with \" Smallville Season 11 : \" . = = = = = Interlude series = = = = = Note : The full title of all volumes listed here start with \" Smallville Season 11 Specials : \" . = = = Chloe Chronicles = = = Allison Mack 's character , Chloe Sullivan , has starred in two promotional tie-in series : Smallville : Chloe Chronicles , and Vengeance Chronicles . Two volumes of Chloe Chronicles totaled eleven mini-episodes . In the first volume Chloe investigated events leading to the death of Earl Jenkins , who held Chloe and her friends hostage at the LuthorCorp plant in the first-season episode \" Jitters \" . It aired from April 29 to May 20 , 2003 to AOL subscribers . After the first volume received positive responses from viewers , the second volume was created as a continuation with Sam Jones III as Pete Ross . This volume used the Smallville comic books as a secondary tie-in to the series . Viewers could watch Smallville , Chloe 's Chronicles and finish with the Smallville comic book , which would provide an \" enhanced backstory to the online segments \" . The later series , Vengeance Chronicles , is a spinoff of the fifth-season episode \" Vengeance \" . In this series Chloe joins a costumed vigilante , whom she calls the \" Angel of Vengeance \" , to expose Lex Luthor 's Level 33.1 experiments on meteor-infected people . The idea for an online show about Chloe originated with Mark Warshaw , who ran the show 's website and was in charge of the DVDs . The series intended to wrap up \" unfinished business \" from the television show . Although Smallville : Chloe Chronicles began on AOL , it made its way to the United Kingdom 's Channel 4 website . According to Lisa Gregorian , senior vice president for television of Warner Bros. Marketing Services , \" Our goal is to create companion programming that offers new and exciting ways to engage the audience , just as music videos did for record promotion . \" Allison Mack described the show as \" very Nancy Drew and mysterious \" : \" I think it 's a bit more like The X-Files or NYPD Blue . The Chronicles are like a detective story , with Chloe following clues and interviewing people , going from spot to spot , figuring things out . \" The scripts were written by Brice Tidwell ; Mack was given script approval for the series , allowing her to review and make changes to the script . Warshaw communicated with Gough and Millar to expand Smallville stories in Chloe 's Chronicles . = = = Promotional tie-ins = = = For the season-three premiere , the Smallville producers teamed up with Verizon to enable its registered users to view plot updates ( as Daily Planet press releases ) , quizzes and games related to the show with Verizon product placement . Smallville Legends : The Oliver Queen Chronicles , a six-episode CGI series chronicling the early life of Oliver Queen , was released in a promotional tie-in with Sprint . According to Warner Bros. Television Group executive vice-president of worldwide marketing Lisa Gregorian , the promotional tie-ins got fans more connected to the show . On April 19 , 2007 a tie-in with Toyota promoting the Yaris featured an online comic strip , Smallville Legends : Justice & Doom , as an interstitial program during new Smallville episodes . The interactive comic was based on the \" Justice \" episode , which follows Oliver Queen , Bart Allen , Victor Stone and Arthur Curry ( the initial members of the \" Justice League \" in Smallville ) as they seek to destroy LuthorCorp 's secret experimental labs . The online series allowed viewers to investigate with the fictional team to win prizes . Stephan Nilson wrote all five episodes , working with a team of artists on the illustrations . Nilson received the plot for each comic episode as Smallville 's production crew was filming its current television episode . Artist Steve Scott drew comic-book panels which were sent to Motherland , a consulting group . Motherland reviewed the drawings , telling Scott which images to draw on a separate overlay ; this allowed objects to be moved in and out of a frame . In 2008 The CW joined the manufacturers of Stride gum to give viewers an opportunity to create their own Smallville digital comic , Smallville : Visions . The writers and producers developed the comic 's beginning and end , allowing viewers to provide the middle . The CW began its tie-in campaign with the March 13 , 2008 episode \" Hero \" , where Pete develops superhuman elasticity after chewing kryptonite-infused Stride gum . On The CW 's website , viewers voted on one of two options ( each adding four pages to the comic ) every Tuesday and Thursday until the campaign ended on April 7 . In season seven Smallville again worked with Sprint , bringing its customers \" mobisodes \" entitled Smallville Legends : Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton with Clark 's cousin Kara . = = = Spin-offs = = = Gough and Millar developed an Aquaman pilot for The WB , with Justin Hartley as Aquaman ( Arthur Curry ) . As work progressed on the Smallville season-five episode \" Aqua \" , although the episode was not intended as a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman spin-off the character was seen as having potential for his own series . Alan Ritchson was not considered for the role in the new series , because Gough and Millar did not consider it a Smallville spin-off . Gough said in November 2005 , \" [ The series ] is going to be a different version of the ' Aquaman ' legend \" and suggested a crossover with Smallville at some point . Although the pilot was given a good chance of being picked up , when The WB and UPN merged into The CW the new network passed on the show . During the sixth season there was talk of spinning off the Green Arrow into his own series , but Hartley refused to talk about the possibility of a spin-off because of his role on Smallville . The actor felt it his duty to respect what the show had accomplished in five seasons , and not \" steal the spotlight \" because there was \" talk \" of a spin-off after his two appearances . According to Hartley , \" talking \" was as far as the spin-off idea ever got . = = Home video = = Seasons one through ten have been released on DVD in Region 1 , 2 and 4 . Seasons five and six were also released in the now-obsolete HD DVD format on November 28 , 2006 and September 18 , 2007 , respectively . Seasons six , seven , eight , nine and ten have been released for Blu-ray . The DVD releases include deleted scenes , behind-the-scenes featurettes and commentary by cast and crew members on selected episodes . The promotional tie-ins Chloe Chronicles and Vengeance Chronicles accompanied the season two , three and five box sets . Other special features include interactive functionality ( such as a tour of Smallville ) , a comic book and DVD-ROM material . = = Merchandise = = Since Smallville began airing , a variety of merchandise connected with the series has been produced . Two soundtrack albums of songs from the show have been released . On February 25 , 2003 Smallville : The Talon Mix , with a group of artists who licensed their music for the show , was issued .

Fisher Plaza , which is the headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher 's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle , is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter 's helipad . This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle , which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza , the Seattle Monorail , and other local landmarks . However , the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle , are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills , California . Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz , Los Angeles , at the Prospect Studios , and the set occupies two stages , including the hospital pieces , but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle . Several props used are genuine medical supplies , including the MRI machine . Prior to being cast , Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives , in her Broadway performance of Spamalot , which garnered their attention . Due to their admiration , the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series , of her choice , which ultimately led in her choosing Grey 's Anatomy . Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition , the producers liked her , and had intentions to add her to the show , but did not know who to cast her as . She also said she was in awe of how the executives said , \" Pick a show , any show \" , a statement she deemed rare . Ramirez 's character was given recurring status in the second season , having been conceived as a love interest for George O 'Malley . At Torres ' initial appearance on the show , she was disliked by fans , due to her getting in the way of O 'Malley and Grey 's relationship . When asked of this , Torres said : \" You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line . Obviously , I 've heard some negative stuff . \" Discussing Izzie Stevens ' relationship with Alex Karev , Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him , assessing that : \" Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her , she forgave him and gave him another chance . And he really screwed her over . \" Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie 's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as \" karma \" , as Alex previously treated Izzie badly , yet as he begins to realize his true feelings , he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny , regarded by her as \" undeniably handsome and totally charming \" . Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny : \" I love the way Izzie lights up when she \u2019 s around him . I love their relationship because it 's so pure and honest and completely game free . \" Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie \" seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny . \" When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny 's condition to move him up the transplant list , series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions , asking : \" Is Izzie bad for doing it ? Is she tremendously irresponsible ? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable ? \" Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny 's deathbed , explaining : \" Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed , not for a prom , but for a funeral . Everyone in dark colors , everyone dressed somberly . As if they were in mourning . Only Izzie is in happy pink . Only Izzie looks like she didn 't know this was coming . \" Peter Horton , expressed that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson 's character , Miranda Bailey , was to focus on the similarities between her and the actress , noting that \" there 's not a mean bone in her body , but she 's solid and steady , like a rock . \" Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character 's personality , noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past , to a maternal outlook on her interns . She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character , describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers , rather than someone living inside her . Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character : \" She gets to be flawed , she gets to be tired , she can be cranky , she can be grumpy . \" Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months . Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson 's portrayal of her character \" sweet and wonderful \" , naming her a professional : \" She makes you be a better actor , just by being there . \" She also described her performance during her character 's labor as \" heart-breaking , tender , powerful and wonderful \" , noting how she managed to transform the strong character into \" a weak woman , struggling to fight the unusual situation \" . Fellow cast member James Pickens , Jr. described Wilson 's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as \" a breath of fresh air , literally and figuratively \" , also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater . Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc , which he stated to have been planning since the beginning of the series . He stated that the plot of the episodes had to \" fill the demands of the Super Bowl \" , which was scheduled to air in the same night : \" We really wanted something different and Shonda [ Rhimes ] came up with the idea of this bomb , that we found simply outstanding ! \" Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how \" breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together \" . He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord , an element they had been trying to avoid , for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous , and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material . He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor : \" When we filmed it , there was a moment , a fraction of a second , when we changed the body with the actor . \" = = Cast = = The second season had ten roles receiving star billing , out of whom nine were returning from the first season .

Also the fame of the show skyrocketed during the season The A.V. Club called the show a \" pokemon \" and \" one of the best TV shows around , burning through plot points at a furious clip , swooning romanticism , at embracing the kind of deeply earnest , intensely felt romance that made the show \u2019 s relationships so great . Meredith \u2019 s famous \" Pick me , choose me , love me \" speech is corny , to be sure , but it \u2019 s got tremendous rhythm and absolute conviction ... season two of Grey \u2019 s was a comet . \" Todd Gilchrist of IGN Entertainment expressed hope in the further development of the series , noting the complex backgrounds of each character as being the series ' focal point . He noted that the ensemble , composed of \" countless comely females and enough strong , competitive males \" remains outstanding in prime time , being iconic , due to the vast interpretations regarding the main cast . Whereas Gilchrist acknowledged that the show gives the impression of it being only for women , he stated that he can attest to its universal , equal-opportunity appeal , assesing that the show \" explores the medical world with both a sense of testosterone-fueled intensity and estrogen-laced sensitivity \" and deserved to have viewers from both genders , championing its merits . In response to the bomb story arc , he called the two episodes \" juicy \" , while assessing that they \" followed a story line that not only explained the series up to that point , but featured all of the characters in their more or less purest from \" . Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character , describing Grey as a \" prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon , waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd \" , while stating that Yang , \" an aggressively ambitious intern \" lacks knowledge on any topic , except medicine , comparing her to boyfriend Burke , described as her opposite . In response to George O 'Malley 's story line , he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon . He also expressed excitement in the doors opened by the previous season 's cliffhanger , seeing the arrival of Montgomery ( Walsh ) as \" certainly speaking to the show 's focus on relationships over the nuts and bolts of being a surgeon \" , while praising Rhimes for continuing to \" merge those disparate elements in the way that does , or at leas should be a source of enthusiasm for both men and women , creating an atmosphere both professional and intimately personal , often at the same time \" . Noting the realism in the writing for the series , Gilchrist stated : \" It 's as if Rhimes and Co. harnessed the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences , that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts , and it transported it on a world that is legitimately fraught with life and death decisions . \" However , he expressed disappointment in the end of the second season , which he deemed surprisingly less strong , compared to the \" powerful \" first half and the \" immaculate \" first season , describing Stevens ' \" awkward and self-destructive \" relationship with a patient as a way to \" slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama \" , while expressing the predictability of Duquette 's death . Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens ' development in the last part of the second season : \" Izzie 's descent into abject hysteria , which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything , actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too . \" He described how some episodes were not among the show 's strongest , noting that the some plot lines created poignancy , and connected in an unfamiliar way . The reviews have stood the test of time and the season still remains a huge critical favorite . Entertainment Weekly reviewing the tenth season of the show acknowledged that , \" the second season is still the show \u2019 s best season to date . \" The site added , \" I do want to talk about what season 10 could learn from what I believe is the show \u2019 s best season to date : season 2 . \" calling in all the signature elements of the show that it did the best with listing all the best moments from the season , \" the elevator \" , \" the walkway \" , \" Joe \u2019 s bar , \" Meredith \u2019 s \" Pick me \" speech \" . and the \" memorable patients \" adding , \" I want two people stuck on a pole ( Into You Like a Train ) or two Amish best friends having to say goodbye , and I want those stories to be given ample time to resonate . More than anything , I want them to affect our doctors in heartbreaking and beautiful ways . \" Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was critical of Izzie 's ethics in cutting Denny 's LVAD wire , writing that she \" should not be practising medicine \" and stating : \" That 's the reason I don 't watch Grey 's Anatomy , anymore , because the super hot blond chick can make an earth-shattering , fatal decision and she doesn 't get canned . \" Regarding the second season , Kevin Carr from 7M Pictures said \" Rhimes really just put Scrubs , E.R. , Sex and the City and even a dash of The Love Boat in a blender and poured out Grey 's Anatomy . \" Also in regard to the second season , Christopher Monfette of IGN TV said \" [ ... ] The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships , whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons - all to a montage-fetish , indie-rock soundtrack \" . = = = Awards and nominations = = = In 2006 , the series won the Golden Globe for \" Best Drama Series \" .

                    "text": "Fringe ( season 3 ) = The third season of the American science fiction television series Fringe commencing airing on the Fox network on September 23 , 2010 , and concluded on May 6 , 2011 . Twenty-two episodes long , the season was produced by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television , and its showrunners were Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman . Lead actors Anna Torv , John Noble , and Joshua Jackson reprised their roles as FBI agent Olivia Dunham and the father-son duo Walter and Peter Bishop . Previous series regulars Lance Reddick , Jasika Nicole , and Blair Brown also returned , along with recurring guest stars Kirk Acevedo , Seth Gabel , and Ryan McDonald . Building off the finale from the previous season , Fringe 's third season dealt with a war between the prime and parallel universes . During the first part of the season , odd-numbered episodes mostly took place in the parallel universe and have a red title sequence , while even-numbered episodes mostly took place in the prime universe and have the original blue title sequence . In episode eight , \" Entrada \" , the title sequence is a mixture of blue and red , and since have been either blue or red or both to signify the universal focus of the episode . In the rest of the season , however , the episodes focus on the prime universe with brief shifts to the parallel universe . Wyman and Pinkner saw Fringe as two shows , where they could provide a detailed mythology that was equally compelling in both universes . Eager to explore \" what-if \" moments , historical idiosyncrasies and other differences were inserted to help disambiguate the two worlds . Much of the season was designed around a doomsday device , as they believed its mysteriousness was \" a great story engine for us . \" The nineteenth episode , \" Lysergic Acid Diethylamide \" , contained long sequences of animation in order to facilitate guest actor 's Leonard Nimoy 's retirement from acting . While the writers had attempted to continue the idea of the \" mythalone \" for both casual and devoted fans , Fringe mythology became more visible in the last episodes of the season . Equating the final three episodes to a chapter in a novel , the writers \" linked [ them ] in one continuous story arc . \" The third season was positively received by television critics , and it earned 77 out of 100 on the aggregate review website Metacritic , indicating critical reception as \" generally favorable . \" Reviewers reacted well to the exploration of the parallel universe , and the performances of Torv and Noble , who each played differing versions of their original characters , were lauded . Fringe ended its third season with an average of 5.83 million viewers per episode , placing 99th for the network television season . The New York Times called the series \" the best major-network show that no one is watching . \" Despite its low ratings , Fox renewed the series for a fourth season on March 24 , 2011 . = = Season summary = = Following Peter 's rescue from the parallel universe , the prime universe Fringe team comes to learn of the Wave Sink Device , the machine that Walternate was attempting to use to destroy the prime universe . They are unaware that Fauxlivia has replaced Olivia , and she works to help the Fringe Division to identify the components hidden across the globe for a similar Wave Form Device in the prime universe . She also gets romantically close to Peter . Olivia is held in Walternate 's laboratories in the parallel universe , and given drugs and conditioning to make her believe she is Fauxlivia , and subsequently a willing test subject for Walternate 's tests of the powers of Cortexiphan . Olivia slowly breaks this conditioning , and on one trial , is able to cross over to the prime universe to relay a warning to Peter about Fauxilivia . Her identity exposed , Fauxilivia is extracted back to the parallel universe by Walternate 's shapeshifters , while Olivia gets help from Broyles to cross back to the prime universe . Olivia is distraught after her return , knowing about Peter 's relationship with Fauxilivia . However , after some time , the two reconcile and admit they have feelings for each other . In the prime universe , the Fringe team learn more of the Wave Sink Device from Sam Weiss , understanding it was created by a long-advanced race known as the First People , with the power to destroy or create universes , but is only powered by Peter 's biology . The two devices in both universes are quantumly entangled , allows one to alter the other universe . Walter surmises that Walternate wants to engage the device to destroy the prime universe in hopes of healing the parallel universe damaged by his crossing in 1985 . In the parallel universe , Walternate discovers Fauxilivia is pregnant with Peter 's child and discreetly accelerates the pregnancy , as to obtain a sample of the child 's blood to activate the Device . The effects on the prime universe are numerous but the parallel universe shows no sign of healing . Walter directs teams to move the prime universe Device to Liberty Island , the same location where the parallel device , as to minimize the affected areas , and then instructs Peter to use the device to counteract the parallel version . Instead , when Peter enters the device , he witnesses a future where the parallel universe was destroyed and the prime universe on verge of the same collapse , and finds that Walter would set a plan in motion to send the Device back into the far past via a wormhole ( creating the First People myth ) , and having it trigger this memory when Peter uses it . After this experience , Peter uses the device to link the two together , fusing the two rooms from the prime and parallel universe into a bridge , allowing the two sides to meet one another . However , shortly after this , Peter disappears to the apparent obliviousness of both Fringe teams ; the Observers , looking on , assert that Peter has erased himself from the timeline to let this event happen . = = Episodes = = = = Production = = = = = Crew = = = Fringe is produced by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television . Co-creator J.J. Abrams continued to work as executive producer along with fellow co-creators Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci , who returned as consulting producers . Bryan Burk and Joe Chappelle also returned as executive producers , while Akiva Goldsman worked as consulting producer . Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman continued in their role as showrunners for the third season , which involved overseeing every episode and sometimes directly contributing episode scripts . As with every season , they laid out the third season 's storyline a year in advance . = = = Writing and filming = = = The season finale of the second season introduced the parallel universe to viewers . Fringe 's producers debated over how much of this universe to depict in the third season , but ultimately decided that showing the doppelgangers would \" fit more into our own character \u2019 s lives and show different aspects of their personalities \" . As a result , Fringe began its third season by alternating between episodes , with each depicting one universe . The Fox network was initially resistant to this design , as executives were \" really concerned that if the episodes didn 't have [ ' over here ' ] Walter or Peter in them , it wouldn \u2019 t feel like our show anymore . \" Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman explained that the series had to constantly evolve , \" otherwise we \u2019 ll get bored , the cast will get bored , the audience will get bored \" ; after the first several episodes of the season , Fox agreed it was a positive change . The producers saw the season as \" two shows \" ; Wyman noted , \" It 's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here , so we will enjoy both of them . We have our characters going back and forth , there or here , but there 's a whole set of nice characters that you 'll become very interested in very quickly . It 's interesting because it gives you that gearshift . \" Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device \" really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelg\u00e4ngers , to illuminate characters we already know . It \u2019 s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show . \" Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe , such as a still-living John F. Kennedy , the non-existence of the FBI , and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox . The writers loved creating an entire new world , and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms , such as within daily routines . Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many \" what-if \" moments , such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers , or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen . \" Entrada \" , the eighth episode , was the first of the season to divide its time between both universes . Many of the episodes involved the discovery and construction of a doomsday device , which Pinkner believed to be \" a good thing to design a season around \" because its mysteriousness was \" a great story engine for us . \" While the writers tried to maintain the concept of the \" mythalone , \" a storyline that was attractive to both casual and devoted Fringe fans , the series became more invested in its mythology towards the end of the third season . \" Lysergic Acid Diethylamide \" , the season 's nineteenth episode , was the first of the series to contain sequences of animation . While previous guest actor Leonard Nimoy had retired , the writers still had storylines involving his character , William Bell . They were able to record his voice , and consequently worked with Zoic Studios to develop the episode . This unorthodox storytelling device was consistent with the nineteenth episodes of other seasons , including \" Brown Betty \" and \" Letters of Transit \" . The final three episodes of the season were \" linked in one continuous story arc , \" and meant to seem like \" you 're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel . And usually in a good novel , the last pages [ of a chapter ] compels you forward with a new understanding of what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you can \u2019 t wait to turn that page . \" The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed , but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved . Pinkner explained that \" we wrote the episode , perhaps foolishly , assuming that we would be on for Season 4 . We never for one second entertained that it would be the end of the series . So therefore , we didn 't have to change a word ! \" The finale was designed to establish the groundwork by \" open [ ing ] a new chapter \" for the new season , which included Peter having never existed . Its futuristic storyline was meant to \" inform the present of the show with some thematic elements , \" establishing to viewers that \" our world is going to break down . \" Different title sequences were inputted to help disambiguate the two universes , as well as establish other versions of their world . Blue and red represented the prime and parallel universes , respectively while \" Entrada \" featured a mixture of blue and red in its title sequence . An episode set in 1985 began with a retro title sequence , and the finale 's version of the title sequence was silver-gray and black . Each opening credit sequence contained specific words that were meant to serve as \" signposts \" for both current and future episodes , such as the finale sequences ' use of \" thought extraction \" and \" dual maternity \" . Like the previous season , the third season was filmed in Vancouver . Because of its heritage buildings and antique storefronts , many of the scenes set in the alternate universe were shot in New Westminster , an area outside Vancouver . Filming of the live action parts of \" Lysergic Acid Diethylamide \" were shot along west Hastings Street . Executive producer Joe Chappelle returned to direct five episodes , while producer Brad Anderson was responsible for directing four . Other new and returning directors included Thomas Yatsko , Jeffrey Hunt , Kenneth Fink , David Straiton , Frederick E. O. Toye , Chuck Russell , and Charles Beeson ; they each directed one episode .

Despite its middling ratings , Fringe received a full third season renewal on March 6 , 2010 . At the beginning of the 2010 \u2013 11 United States network television schedule , Fringe remained in its Thursday timeslot for the first nine episodes of the third season , where it faced tough competition from the high-rated Grey 's Anatomy and CSI : Crime Scene Investigation . The season premiere aired on September 23 , 2010 to 5.83 million viewers in the United States , earning a 2.1 rating for viewers 18 \u2013 49 . This was thirty percent down from the previous season 's premiere , \" A New Day in the Old Town \" . On its initial broadcast on November 4 , the fifth episode hit a then-season low of 1.8 / 5 in the adult demographic . Fox moved Fringe to a new Friday night timeslot on January 21 , 2011 , where it typically broadcast opposite Supernatural , Dateline NBC , and CSI : NY . Because of the night 's \" death slot \" status , this move made television critics and fans nervous that Fringe was near cancellation . For the first few episodes in its new timeslot , its ratings remained consistent with previous Thursday episodes , but soon began to drop . There were some positive aspects of the third season 's ratings however . Among adults aged 18 to 49 , Fringe placed first in its Friday timeslot . Total viewers , as well as the ratings share for adults and teenagers , surpassed Fox 's average for that same timeslot . Furthermore , the average household income of Fringe 's adult viewers was higher than the total U.S. adult population average , and its adult viewers also had a higher index of having four or more years of college . Despite its low ratings , Fringe was officially renewed for a fourth season on March 24 , 2011 to the surprise of observers \u2013 six days before the renewal , Fringe had reached a new series ratings low . The renewal came in the wake of campaigns conducted by Fringe actors , fans of the series , and television critics . Kevin Reilly , Fox 's entertainment president , commented that \" the series ' ingenious producers , amazingly talented cast and crew , as well as some of the most passionate and loyal fans on the planet , made this fourth-season pickup possible . \" Fringe ended its third season with an average of 5.83 million viewers per episode , finishing in 99th place for the American network television season . Time shifted viewing played a significant part in Fringe 's third season ratings . According to a report released by Nielsen Company , Fringe was the only network television series among the top ten of most time-shifted shows of 2011 . The report continued that time shifting increased the series ' overall audience by eighty percent . = = = Reviews = = = Film aggregate review site Metacritic gave the third season 77 out of 100 based on six critical reviews , indicating the critical reception was \" generally favorable \" . Critic Josh Wigler , writing for Comic Book Resources , lauded the season 's first two episodes , explaining \" For the third season of the critically acclaimed Fox series , executive producers and co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman have responded to their audience 's demands by creating a new kind of episode : the mythalone , designed to propel the story and characters forward while still keeping the show accessible to new viewers on a weekly basis ... it 's nothing short of amazing that the new mythalone approach to Fringe works wonders , if only in the first two episodes of the new season . \" After watching the first three episodes , Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also praised the new season , writing \" The plots have generally been the \" fringe \" of Fringe ; the meat has been in the characters ' developing feelings for one another . Now the two are not only on equal footing , but they 're both firing on full cylinders ... Afraid , perhaps , to toy with viewers the way that Lost did , Fringe keeps the action moving , rapidly unspooling its mysteries , and that decision proves to be a wise one . Rather than waiting for a future payoff , Fringe is cashing in with every episode , showing us the escalating war between worlds \u2014 and with likeable characters and compelling cases to boot . Ironically , it 's by branching out in two different directions that the show has become , more than ever , the centerpiece of a hypercompetitive Thursday night lineup . \" In December 2010 , the New York Times wrote Fringe \" has kept its plates spinning entertainingly well into its third season \" and called it \" the best major-network show that no one is watching \" . Because of its \" ultra-daring \" and \" bold \" storylines , IGN gave Fringe their award for \" Best Sci-Fi Series \" in 2010 . They noted , \" With stellar performances , sci-fi intrigue and a newly introduced Doomsday machine in play that almost guarantees the two worlds will face off Thunderdome-style , this series just keeps getting better and better . \" For 2011 , Fringe 's third season helped the show place sixth on Digital Spy 's top 25 television shows of the year , which described the season as \" exemplary \" . Similarly , The A.V. Club named Fringe the sixteenth best television series of 2011 , in particular highlighting \" Lysergic Acid Diethylamide \" and \" The Firefly \" . As the third season involved doppelgangers of known characters , specific actors were selected for praise from critics . Lead actress Anna Torv was lauded from multiple quarters for portraying two Olivias , one from each universe . Critics were more divided about her performance as William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) , with some praising it and others remaining undecided or critical . John Noble 's performances as Walter Bishop and his doppelganger \" Walternate \" received positive recognition from critics , with one noting he was \" astonishing me with every performance . \" Specific episodes that were isolated for praise among critics included \" Entrada \" , \" Subject 13 \" , and \" The Day We Died \" . \" Lysergic Acid Diethylamide \" was lauded for its risky premise . In her 2011 book Into the Looking Glass : Exploring the Worlds of Fringe , author Sarah Clarke Stuart noted that the third season 's \" apocalyptic nature was fitting for an audience in the midst of such seemingly world-ending economic turmoil in 2010 \u2013 2011 . \" To Clarke Stuart , Walter 's remark in the episode \" 6B \" that the world is tearing apart reflected \" the sentiments of American viewers who were facing job loss and displacement at an unprecedented level . \" = = = Awards and nominations = = = For the 1st Critics ' Choice Television Awards , it was nominated for Best Drama Series and Anna Torv was nominated for Best Actress in Drama Series .

Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX-01 . The second season saw the series continue a concentration on stand-alone episodes as seen in the debut season , but the decision was made to start an ongoing story-arc to run into the third season with the second season finale episode \" The Expanse \" .

Berman and Brannon Braga sought to bring Patrick Stewart in to direct an episode of Enterprise , and it was also suggested that either he or Whoopi Goldberg could appear on-screen as their Star Trek : The Next Generation characters . Berman also said he was open to an appearance by William Shatner . According to the Nielsen Ratings received for the episodes , the season stayed steady above four percent with the exception of two dips below that level . One of these dips included the episode \" Horizon \" , which with its 2.2 percent rating , was the lowest viewed episode of the series at that point . The critical reception to the second season was mixed , with one reviewer stating that the series did not learn from the mistakes of the first season and another calling it childish for the lack of consequences being seen in the episodes . However , the introduction of the ongoing story-line in the season finale was met with praise . The series was nominated for five Emmy Awards , four Saturn Awards and two Hugo Awards but did not win in any categories . = = Plot overview = = The second season continues the Human exploration of interstellar space by the crew of Enterprise , and further mention is made of the Temporal Cold War . The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races , such as the Vulcans , Andorians , Klingons , Romulans , Tholians , Borg , and Tellarites , are also explored further . The season ends with a cliffhanger that sets up the Xindi story arc , set in the Delphic Expanse , of the third season . = = Cast = = = = = Main cast = = = = = = Recurring cast = = = = = Episodes = = In the following table , episodes are listed by the order in which they aired . = = Production = = Production on the second season of Enterprise began on June 24 , 2002 , on a location shoot for the second episode of the season , \" Carbon Creek \" . Once production on that episode was complete , the crew moved onto the second part of \" Shockwave \" , which would be broadcast first . It was produced in that order as \" Carbon Creek \" only required Scott Bakula , Connor Trinneer and Jolene Blalock from the main cast to appear . The remaining cast returned on July 10 , for the first day of production for the second half of \" Shockwave \" . Executive producer Rick Berman was looking forward to resuming writing with Brannon Braga on episodes of Enterprise as he had been previously busy with work on the film Star Trek : Nemesis . He was also in talks to bring Patrick Stewart in to direct an episode of the series , saying that the pair had discussed this and Stewart was interested but was busy at the time filming X2 in Canada . He added that once Stewart had a few weeks spare in his schedule , that they would see if he could be brought in to direct an episode . Two other Star Trek alumni returned to Enterprise to direct . These were Roxann Dawson and LeVar Burton . Dawson had previously played B 'Elanna Torres on Star Trek : Voyager , and had directed the episodes \" The Andorian Incident \" and \" Vox Sola \" during the first season of Enterprise as well as two episodes of Voyager . She said that after a season of working together , the cast of Enterprise were finding their characters \" beautifully \" . Prior to the second season cast members Linda Park and Connor Trinneer undertook the same directing course that Dawson previously took during her time on Voyager . Burton had played Geordi La Forge in Star Trek : The Next Generation , before moving into directing with the 100th episode of Voyager , \" Timeless \" . He had directed two episodes of Enterprise during the first season , and filmed a further two during the second season including \" First Flight \" . This episode was the 50th episode of the series and featured guest appearances from three members of the crew of the United States Navy aircraft carrier USS Enterprise ( CVN-65 ) . There were several links in promotion between Star Trek : Nemesis and Enterprise , as season two saw Enterprise form half of a two-hour block called \" Out of This World Wednesdays on UPN \" , with a new series of The Twilight Zone forming the second half . This promotion had a Nemesis competition tied into it , offering the chance for five winners to take a trip to Los Angeles to attend the premiere of the film . Another competition linked Nemesis back to Enterprise , with participating Loews Cinemas offering the chance to win a walk-on role on the series . = = Themes = = Brannon Braga said that the production team sought to increase the tempo of season two compared to the first season . He said at a press junket held by the Television Critics Association in July 2002 that \" We 're just starting . We want to capitalise more on the fact that [ Enterprise ] is a sequel . We want to have a season that maybe has more action in it than it had last season . \" He predicted that possible storylines would include Jonathan Archer fulfilling more of his potential as Captain of the Enterprise , as well as further instalments in the Temporal Cold War story-arc and further interactions between the crew and both the Andorians and the Vulcans . Braga said that they wanted to avoid overloading the Temporal Cold War but instead they wanted to create an ongoing element to the series during season two . He expected that it would feature in the first episode of the season , \" Shockwave \" ( part two ) , but then there would be a break before it was featured again . He also revealed that the recurring character of Daniels wasn 't entirely human , and that this would be revealed during the second season while at a panel discussion at the Official Star Trek Convention in Las Vegas in August 2002 . Berman , said that the revelation of who was controlling the Suliban would not be shown during the second season , but he promised a \" really good \" season and was open to William Shatner appearing in the show . Scott Bakula also referred to a previous discussion with Berman where the producer suggested that Patrick Stewart or Whoopi Goldberg could appear on-screen in the second season through the means of time travel from their time on Star Trek : The Next Generation . Perhaps the biggest announcement made prior to the start of the season was the return of the Romulans to Star Trek . They had not previously been seen on Enterprise , and Braga was well aware that they would have to carefully consider the continuity as the crew of James T. Kirk 's Enterprise were the first to see a Romulan in the episode \" Balance of Terror \" . He said \" The continuity is airtight . Believe me . We know . We know ... \" . The species were due to make their first appearance in the Star Trek timeline in the episode \" Minefield \" , which was written by former The X-Files writer John Shiban . At the same time that the Romulans were due to appear in Enterprise , work was underway on the Romulan-centric film , Star Trek : Nemesis . The second season also saw an appearance by the Borg in the episode \" Regeneration \" , which was intended to follow up on the events in Star Trek : First Contact . = = Reception = = = = = Ratings = = = The season opened with Nielsen ratings of 4.9 / 8 percent for \" Shockwave \" ( part two ) . This means that it was seen by 4.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds , and 8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . The ratings received for the season rose over the next few episodes to 5.4 / 8 percent for \" Dead Stop \" - the most watched episode of the season . \" Vanishing Point \" was the first episode of the season to drop below a 4 percent rating , but not the last as \" Judgment \" , \" The Breach \" and \" Horizon \" also received ratings below the season average . The ratings received by \" Horizon \" of 2.2 percent were a series low at that point . But the ratings increased following that trio of episodes , and the season ended with \" The Expanse \" receiving ratings of 4.4 / 7 percent . = = = Critical response = = = At the time of the broadcast of the final episode of the season , Scott D. Pierce for the Deseret News described Enterprise as not \" an awful show , it 's just , well , boring . \" He called the new story arc introduced in \" The Expanse \" a \" promising idea \" . But also added , \" it 's pretty hard to get your hopes up too high for Enterprise . \" Randy Miller III , in his review of the Blu-ray release of the second season for DVD Talk , said that the memory of this season was worse than it actually was . He criticised the studio 's instance at stand-alone episodes but said that there was a marked improvement about halfway through the season , calling the finale \" game-changing \" . He added that at the time of the DVD release , he did not feel so positively towards the season and agreed with Holly Ordway 's opinion at the time . Ordway had said that the second season sought to be more realistic , but that it feels childish as no one gets hurt or killed - even in the episode \" Marauders \" which saw a group of colonists defend themselves from renegade Klingons . She called the finale a \" giant reset button \" on the series , adding that it seemed that the show was about to become a sequel to Voyager but squandering the premise it had been given . Michael Simpson , while writing for SciFiNow , suggested that the second season of Enterprise \" suggests a fatal failure to recognise what went wrong \" with the first season . He said that the inclusion of the Borg in the episode \" Regeneration \" lacked fresh ideas as a similar idea had previously appeared in season one with the Ferengi making first contact but not being named in \" Acquisition \" . He was frustrated with the season due to the \" unfulfilled potential \" , and praised episodes such as \" Carbon Creek \" , \" Singularity \" and \" Cogenitor \" . James Hunt at the website Den of Geek placed three second season episodes in his top ten list of Enterprise . In ninth place , \" First Flight \" was chosen as it demonstrated that Jonathan Archer was \" the most Kirk-esque Captain since the original \" . \" Regeneration \" was placed in third position , while \" Carbon Creek \" was the runner-up for the best episode because it was an early episode in which the series found its feet . = = = Awards = = = Enterprise received five nominations in three categories at the 55th Primetime Emmy Awards . Three of these were in the \" Outstanding Special Visual Effects For A Series \" category ; \" Dead Stop \" , \" The Crossing \" and \" The Expanse \" . The series had won that category at the 54th Emmy Awards , for the pilot \" Broken Bow \" . Michael Westmore 's team was nominated for \" Outstanding Makeup For A Series ( Prosthetic ) \" for their work on the episode \" Canamar \" and Dennis McCarthy musical score for \" The Expanse \" was nominated for \" Outstanding Music Composition For A Series ( Dramatic Underscore ) \" . Both \" Carbon Creek \" and \" A Night in Sickbay \" were nominated at the 2003 Hugo Awards for \" Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form \" , but lost to \" Conversations with Dead People \" - an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer . At the 29th Saturn Awards , the series was nominated for \" Best Network Television Series \" and Scott Bakula , Joelene Blalock and Connor Trinneer were nominated for \" Best Actor on Television \" , \" Best Supporting Actress on Television \" and \" Best Supporting Actor on Television \" , respectively . However , the series did not win any of the awards it was nominated for . = = Media information = = As part of the releases of Enterprise on Blu-ray announced in early 2013 , a box set featuring the episodes of the second season was released on August 19 in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States and Canada .",

                    "text": "The Bill = The Bill is a British police procedural television series , first broadcast on ITV from 16 October 1984 until 31 August 2010 . The programme originated from a one-off drama , Woodentop , broadcast in August 1983 . In its final year on air , The Bill was broadcast once a week , usually on Tuesdays or Thursdays , in a one-hour format . The programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of police officers , rather than on any particular aspect of police work . The Bill was the longest-running police procedural television series in the United Kingdom , and among the longest running of any British television series . The title originates from \" Old Bill \" , a slang term for the police . Although highly acclaimed by fans and critics , the series attracted controversy on several occasions . An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis . The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence , particularly prior to 2009 , when it occupied a pre-watershed slot . The Bill won several awards , including BAFTAs , a Writers ' Guild of Great Britain award and Best Drama at the Inside Soap Awards in 2009 , this being the series ' fourth consecutive win . Throughout its twenty-seven-year run , the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network . In later years , episodes of the show were repeated on ITV3 on their week of broadcast . The series has also been repeated on other digital stations , including Gold , Alibi , Watch , Dave and Drama . In March 2010 , executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission The Bill , and that filming on the series would cease on 14 June 2010 . The last episode aired on 31 August 2010 . = = History = = The Bill was originally conceived by Geoff McQueen in 1983 , then a relatively new television writer , as a one-off drama . McQueen had originally titled the production \" Old Bill \" . It was picked up by Michael Chapman for ITV franchise holder Thames Television , who retitled it \" Woodentop \" as part of Thames ' \" Storyboard \" series of one-off dramas and was broadcast on ITV under the title Woodentop on 16 August 1983 . Woodentop starred Mark Wingett as Police Constable Jim Carver and Trudie Goodwin as Woman Police Constable June Ackland of London 's Metropolitan Police , both attached to the fictional Sun Hill police station . Although originally only intended as a one-off , Woodentop impressed ITV to the extent that a full series was commissioned , first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one post-watershed episode per week , featuring an hour-long , separate storyline for each episode of the first three series . The first episode of the full series was \" Funny Ol ' Business \u2013 Cops & Robbers \" . With serialisation , the name of the show changed from \" Woodentop \" to \" The Bill \" . In its first four years the series was broadcast between July onwards each year , with a 12-week summer break from May until the next July . The series then changed to two episodes , each of thirty minutes on Tuesdays and Thurdsays , per week in 1988 ( from July 1988 onwards , the series also began being broadcast all year round without a summer break ) , increasing to three a week beginning in 1993 , with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays . In 1998 , The Bill returned to hour-long episodes , which later became twice-weekly , with the Friday episode , being dropped , at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach . When Paul Marquess took over as executive producer in 2002 , as part of a drive for ratings , the series was revamped , bringing in a more soap opera type feel to many of its stories . Many veteran characters were written out , leading to the Sun Hill fire during 2002 . Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce \" plausible , powerful new characters \" . As part of the new serial format , much more of the characters ' personal lives were explored , however , as Marquess put it , the viewers still \" don 't go home with them \" . The change also allowed The Bill to become more reflective of modern policing with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities , most notably the new superintendent , Adam Okaro . It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant Craig Gilmore and PC Luke Ashton , a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival Merseybeat . In 2005 , Johnathan Young took over as executive producer . The serial format was dropped and The Bill returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers . 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles , which had been dropped in 2002 . In 2009 , The Bill moved back to the 9 pm slot it previously held and the theme tune , \" Overkill \" , was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series . = = = Cancellation = = = On 26 March 2010 , ITV announced it would be cancelling the series later that year after 26 years on air . ITV said that this decision reflected the \" changing tastes \" of viewers . The last episode of The Bill was filmed in June 2010 and broadcast on 31 August 2010 followed by a documentary titled Farewell The Bill . Fans of the show started a ' Save the Bill ' campaign on social networking website Facebook in an effort to persuade ITV to reconsider the cancellation , and some radio broadcasters , including BBC Radio One 's Chris Moyles , presented special features on the programme 's cancellation . At the time of the series ' end in August 2010 , The Bill was the United Kingdom 's longest-running police drama and was among the longest-running of any British television series . The series finale , entitled \" Respect \" , was aired in two parts and was dedicated to \" the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Service past and present \" . The finale storyline concerned gang member Jasmine Harris being involved in the murder of fellow member Liam Martin who died in the arms of Inspector Smith after being stabbed . Jasmine is then gang raped because she talked to the police and when Callum Stone found the person responsible he was held at gunpoint . Of the title for the finale , Executive Producer Johnathan Young said \" It 's called \" Respect \" and we hope it will respect the heritage of the show \" . The finale episodes featured all the cast and the final scene was specially written so all cast members would be featured . Following the final episode , ITV aired a documentary entitled Farewell The Bill which featured interviews from past and present cast and crew members . The finale was watched by 4.4 million viewers , with Farewell The Bill averaging 1.661 million viewers . = = Broadcasting and production = = = = = Filming locations = = = Throughout the series , there have been three filming locations for Sun Hill police station . From the first series , the police station consisted of a set of buildings in Artichoke Hill , Wapping , East London . However , these buildings were next to the News International plant and during the winter of 1985 \u2013 86 there was much industrial action which resulted in some altercations between the strikers and what they thought were the real police but were actually actors working on The Bill . Working conditions got so dire , that the production team realised they needed to find another base to set Sun Hill police station . The second location was an old record distribution depot in Barlby Road , North Kensington in North West London . Filming began here in March 1987 . In 1989 , the owners of the Barlby Road site ordered The Bill out , due to their redevelopment plans for the area . After an extensive search , two sites were selected , the favourite being a disused hospital in Clapham . However , this fell through and the second option was chosen \u2013 an old wine distribution warehouse in Merton , South West London . The move was made in March 1990 and was disguised on screen by the ' ongoing ' refurbishment of Sun Hill police station and then finally the explosion of a terrorist car-bomb in the station car-park , which ended up killing PC Ken Melvin . Filming for the series took place all over London , mainly in South London and particularly the London Borough of Merton , where the Sun Hill set was located . Locations used when the show was filmed on a housing estate included : Cambridge Estate , in Kingston , south-west London High Path Estate , in South Wimbledon , south-west London ( approx . 10-minute walk from the Sun Hill set ) Phipps Bridge , Mitcham Roundshaw Estate in Wallington , London Sutton Estate , which includes Durand Close in Carshalton , where a housing block regularly used by The Bill for filming was demolished in November 2009 . Scenes were often filmed in east London , most notably the London Docklands , with other scenes filmed in Tooting , Greenwich and Croydon . = = = = \" Sun Hill \" = = = = The Bill is set in and around Sun Hill police station , in the fictional \" Canley Borough Operational Command Unit \" in East London . Geoff McQueen , creator of The Bill , claimed that he named Sun Hill after a street name in his home town of Royston , Hertfordshire . The fictional Sun Hill suburb is located in the fictional London borough of Canley in the East End , north of the River Thames . The Borough of Canley is approximately contiguous to the real-life London Borough of Tower Hamlets , and in the first few years of The Bill , Sun Hill police station was actually stated as being located in Wapping in Tower Hamlets . Sun Hill has a London E1 postcode ( the ' address ' of Sun Hill police station is given as ' 2 Sun Hill Road , Sun Hill , Canley E1 4 km ' . ) , which corresponds to the real-life areas of Whitechapel and Stepney . = = = Production details = = = When filming The Bill , some scenes were re-enacted indoors with microphones surrounding the actors and the extra sounds being \" dubbed \" on later . Some of the more aggressive scenes were also filmed indoors either for dubbing or safety reasons . When filming scenes involving police cars , a camera was attached to the outside of the car which feeds back images to a digital recorder in the back of the vehicle . This technique was used to film the new opening titles of The Bill . The sirens used in the series were added later in the dubbing suite as The Bill did not have permission to use sirens while on location . However , the police uniforms used in the series were genuine , again making The Bill unique amongst police dramas . When the series ended , London 's Metropolitan Police Service , after talks with the production company , bought 400 kilograms of police related paraphernalia , including flat caps and stab vests etc. to prevent them falling into the hands of criminals or those who would seek to use them for criminal activities after the programme 's production ceased . The Bill is unique amongst police dramas in that it takes a serial format , focussing on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers , rather than on one particular area of police work . Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series , whereas comparable series started with the serial format . = = = Broadcast in the United Kingdom = = = During its initial broadcast , The Bill was always shown on ITV . In 2009 , STV , ITV 's regional franchise in Central and Northern Scotland , opted out of broadcasting the series along with a number of other dramas , a decision that later became the subject of legal proceedings between STV and the main ITV network . The legal dispute was settled on 27 April 2011 , with ITV receiving \u00a3 18 million from STV . Aside from repeats of episodes on ITV3 , which occurred on the original week of their broadcast , the show has regularly been repeated on other digital stations . Re-runs of the series began on 1 November 1992 , when new digital channel UKTV Gold began broadcasting . The channel broadcast repeats of the series for nearly sixteen years , until 6 October 2008 , when the channel was given a revamp by the owners of the network . During the sixteen-year period , re-runs of the series covered every episode broadcast between 16 October 1984 , and 8 March 2007 . On 7 October 2008 , UKTV launched a new British drama channel , Alibi , and from this point on , episodes of the series were broadcast in the 8 am slot on the channel . Alibi broadcast episodes until 23 December 2009 , when the show was taken from the channel 's schedule due to poor viewer feedback . During the fourteen months that the show broadcast on Alibi , the channel covered all of the episodes broadcast between 25 August 1998 and 27 February 2002 . On 27 January 2010 , UKTV relocated The Bill to one of its more recent entertainment channels , Watch . Watch began by airing the episode \" Sweet Revenge \" , broadcast on 21 March 2007 . Thus , they continued in broadcast order , carrying on from where their predecessor , UKTV Gold , had finished . Through the course of the year , the channel continued to broadcast episodes from the latter years of the show , concluding in November 2010 with the episode \" Conviction : Judgement Day \" , broadcast on 16 July 2009 . Following a short break from the network , the series returned in December 2010 , beginning with Episode # 001 , broadcast on 28 February 2002 . This continued on from the broadcast order of episodes repeated on Alibi , carrying on from where the network had finished . As of April 2012 , Watch had repeated every single episode from 28 February 2002 to 24 February 2005 , and was to begin airing episodes from March 2005 . In July 2013 the show started to be broadcast by UKTV channel Drama , starting with episodes from 1998 . = = = Broadcast outside the UK = = = The Bill has been broadcast in over 55 different countries . In Australia The Bill was shown on ABC1 . The final episode was shown on 16 October 2010 , with Farewell The Bill shown the following week on 23 October . On Wednesday 3 February 2016 , ABC1 commenced repeating the entire series from the pilot episode in an afternoon weekday timeslot , with early-morning repeats . On pay television services in Australia and New Zealand , older episodes are broadcast on UKTV . In Denmark the series was retitled \" Lov og Uorden \" ( Law and Disorder ) . Two episodes of the series were broadcast every afternoon on TV2 Charlie . In Ireland the series was broadcast on RT\u00c9 television , first starting in the early 1990s on RT\u00c9 Two , and in the early 2000s RT\u00c9 began broadcasting it on RT\u00c9 One at 5 : 30 pm each weekday , splitting hour long episodes into two-part half-hour episodes . RT\u00c9 discontinued this in 2009 , moving the show to Monday Nights on RT\u00c9 Two . RT\u00c9 showed episodes from 2005 . AIn 2010 RT\u00c9 moved the show from its prime time slot on RT\u00c9 Two to a midnight slot on RT\u00c9 One on Thursday nights , but the show remained on the RT\u00c9 player . In Sweden the series was retitled \" Sunhillspolisstation \" ( Sun Hill Police Station ) by broadcaster TV4 . In 2011 it was broadcast daily on Kanal 9 in the early afternoon with a repeat early the following morning . = = Themes and title sequences = = The pilot episode of the series , \" Woodentop \" , featured a short theme composed by Mike Westergaard . The theme was used specifically for the episode and was never used at any time during the main series . The title sequence for the episode consisted simply of the word ' Woodentop ' being spelt out letter by letter , as if someone was writing it on a typewriter . The first ever opening sequence of The Bill was first seen in the episode \" Funny Ol ' Business \u2013 Cops & Robbers \" . The sequence consisted of two police officers , one male and one female , walking down a street , whilst images of Sun Hill were interspersed between them . This sequence was used for the first series only . It featured the first version of the series iconic theme tune , \" Overkill \" , composed by Charlie Morgan and Andy Pask . The theme is notable for its use of septuple meter . The end titles of the series simply showed the feet of the two police constables pounding the beat . In the second series of the show , the opening sequence consisted of a police car , a Rover SD1 , racing down a street with its siren wailing and its blue flashing light on . The car would screech to a stop , and the camera would zoom in on the blue light . Various clips were then shown from the series of the characters in action , often chasing suspects . This sequence kept the first version of \" Overkill \" , and also used the same ending credits from series one . This sequence was also used in the third series . From the fourth series onwards , the opening sequence was kept generally the same ; however , clips from the series used were regularly updated to remove departed characters and keep to date with the show 's events . Minor changes to the sequence included the Rover SD1 changing into a Ford Sierra in 1993 , which was replaced by a Vauxhall Vectra in 1997 . In the 1997 sequence , the Vectra was seen overtaking a Leyland Titan bus , before screeching to a halt , and the main sequence starting . The end credits for the series remained the same , but a new version of \" Overkill \" was used , also composed by Andy Pask and Charlie Morgan . On 6 January 1998 , starting with \" Hard Cash \" , the third episode of the show 's fourteenth series , the title sequence and theme used for nearly ten years were scrapped . This time , the title sequence consisted of various police procedural images , including a suspect being shown into a police cell , another suspect being interviewed , and a third posing for mug shot photographs . Clips of any of the actors featured were removed , as was the initial sequence involving the police car racing down the street . Pask and Morgan revamped \" Overkill \" , giving it a jazz feel , with the majority of the theme played by a saxophone . The end credits of the series were also completely revamped . This time , the credits featured various images of the Metropolitan Police uniform , combined with images of a feet tapping on a kerb . A longer version of \" Overkill \" was also used in the final credits , this time composed by Mark Russell . These opening and closing sequences were used for nearly three years , although both saw minor updates in 1999 . The text sequence at the very start of the opening sequence was changed into a different font , and the images of the police uniform and feet tapping on a curb were removed from the closing sequence to make way for a preview of the next episode . The closing sequence remained this way until 2001 , but the opening titles were once again updated in 2000 to remove certain images from the sequence to make it shorter . It is also noted that during this period , a ' previously on The Bill ' segment was aired before the title sequence , to inform views what had occurred in the last episode . On 20 February 2001 , starting with \" Going Under \" , the fourteenth episode of the show 's seventeenth series , the opening and closing sequences were once again scrapped to make way for a completely new sequence and theme . This time , the opening sequence consisted of a montage image of the entire cast , backed by a darker , slower version of \" Overkill \" . The closing credits featured a montage of various police-related images , also backed by the new version of \" Overkill \" . The opening sequence was designed by the visuals company \" Blue \" , and the new arrangement of \" Overkill \" was produced by Miles Bould and Mike Westergaard . These titles remained essentially the same for two years , with two small updates . The font used on the closing credits was changed towards the end of 2001 , and the characters featured in the opening sequence were updated in 2002 , to remove characters who had departed , and include new characters . These titles were broadcast from Episode No. 017 , and are notable as several of the characters in these titles had not yet appeared in the show . DS Samantha Nixon appeared in the titles from Episode No. 017 , but did not first appear until Episode No. 038 , some four months later . On 13 February 2003 , starting with Episode No. 090 , the opening and closing sequences were once again updated . This time , the opening sequence consisted of several generic police images , such as a police car and uniform . A new arrangement of \" Overkill \" , made by Lawrence Oakley , was also used for both the opening and closing sequences . The background of the closing sequence , designed by company \" Roisin at Blue \" , was simply a police shade of blue , with all generic images being removed . Throughout its four-year use , these titles were never updated or changed , with the exception of the police shade of blue , which was changed to a dark shade of black in 2006 . On 3 January 2007 , starting with Episode No. 471 , the opening and closing sequences were once again changed . This time , the opening sequence , for the first time , features an image of the \" Sun Hill \" sign , and returns to featuring images of officers in action . This sequence also featured a further new arrangement of \" Overkill \" , once again arranged by Lawrence Oakley . This time , the closing sequence follows a police car on patrol , watching it as it drives through the streets of Sun Hill . These titles were used for nearly two and a half years . On 23 July 2009 , after the programme underwent a major overhaul , the opening sequence and theme were heavily changed . This time , the classic \" Overkill \" theme was completely removed , and a new theme created by Simba Studios was used . However , producer Jonathan Young stated that echoes of \" Overkill \" can still be heard in the theme . The opening sequence featured a patrol car driving through the streets of Sun Hill . The closing sequence follows the same patrol car , however , this time , from an overhead view . These titles remained the same until the show 's final episode , where the theme tune was replaced by a final version of \" Overkill \" , in homage to the show . = = Episodes = = When The Bill was first commissioned as a series by ITV , it started with twelve episodes per year , each an hour long with a separate storyline . In 1988 the format changed to year round broadcast with two thirty-minute episodes per week . In 1993 this expanded to three thirty-minute episodes per week . In 1998 the broadcast format changed to two , one hour episodes each week . Episodes were now recorded in 16 : 9 widescreen digibeta .

He left the series temporarily in 2003 , as the culmination of a storyline where his character was raped . He made several guest appearances before returning as a regular in 2005 . = = Ratings = = The Bill has become a popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries , most notably in Australia . The series attracted audiences of up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009 . Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode , in which six officers were killed and the 2003 live episode attracted ten million viewers- forty percent of the UK audience share . Immediately following The Bill 's revamping and time slot change , it was reported that the programme had attracted 4.5 million viewers , 19 % of the audience share , however , it lost out to the BBC 's New Tricks with the Daily Mirror later reporting that ITV 's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings . In 2001 , prior to Paul Marquess ' appointment as executive producer , The Bill 's ratings had dropped to approximately six million viewers and advertising revenues had fallen , in part due to the ageing demographic of its viewers , leading ITV to order a \" rejuvenation \" which saw the series adopt a serial format . In 2002 , The Independent reported that The Bill 's Thursday episode was viewed by approximately 7 million people , a fall of approximately 3 million viewers in the space of 6 months . After the cast clearout resulting from the Sun Hill fire in April 2002 , BBC News reported that The Bill attracted 8.6 million viewers , the highest figure for the year to that point , and by October 2003 , the program had around 8 million viewers each week . In 2005 , The Bill was averaging around 11 million viewers , in comparison to Coronation Street , which was attracting around 10 million viewers . In 2009 , The Daily Mirror reported that The Bill was to be moved to a post-watershed slot to allow it to cover grittier storylines . It was reported that it is the first time in British Television that ITV have broadcast a drama all year in the 9 pm slot . The changeover happened at the end of July 2009 . Before the move , The Bill was averaging 5 million viewers between the two episodes each week . BARB reports that the week 12 \u2013 18 October 2009 saw 3.78 million viewers watch The Bill . = = Awards = = The Bill has achieved a number of awards throughout its time on air , ranging from a BAFTA to the Royal Television Society Awards. and the Inside Soap Awards , particularly the \" best recurring drama \" category . In 2010 , The Bill was nominated for a Royal Television Society award for Best Soap / Continuing Drama , beating both Coronation Street and Emmerdale on to the nominations list . The only soap to be nominated was EastEnders and the results were announced on 16 March 2010 . In 2009 an episode of The Bill won the Knights of Illumination Award for Lighting Design- Drama . = = Impact and history = = The Bill was Britain 's longest running police drama . It has been compared to Hill Street Blues due to the similar , serial , format that both series take . However , The Bill has seen little direct competition on British television in the police procedural genre over its twenty-five-year history , though the BBC has twice launched rival series . The first was Merseybeat , which ran from 2001 but was cancelled in 2004 due to poor ratings and problems with the cast . The second , HolbyBlue , launched in 2007 , was a spin-off of successful medical drama Holby City ( itself a spin-off of the long-running Casualty ) . It was scheduled to go \" head to head \" with The Bill , prompting a brief \" ratings war \" , however HolbyBlue was also cancelled by the BBC in 2008 , again , largely due to poor ratings . When The Bill started , the majority of the Police Federation were opposed to the programme , claiming that it portrayed the police as a racist organisation , however , feelings towards the programme have now mellowed to the extent that Executive Producer Johnathan Young met with Sir Ian Blair , then Commissioner of the Met in 2006 and it was decided that the editorial relationship between the police and the programme was sufficient . However , Young stressed that The Bill is not \" editorially bound \" to the police . Despite better relations with the police , The Bill has still not been without controversy . The Bill has been repeatedly criticised for the high levels of violence portrayed in its scenes , especially prior to 2009 when it occupied a pre-watershed timeslot . Specific story lines have also come under fire in the media , such as that surrounding a gay kiss in 2002 , as well as an episode broadcast in March 2008 which featured a fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis , leading the MS Society to brand the plot \" grossly irresponsible \" . The series has also been criticised by the tabloid press for the replacing of the iconic theme tune as part of a revamping effort . = = Spin-offs and related series = = During its 27-year-run , The Bill spawned several spin-off productions and related series in German and Dutch languages , as well as a series of documentaries . The following is a list of the most notable of these . Bureau Kruislaan : Dutch interpretation of the series . Produced by Joop van den Ende for VARA Television , the programme lasted for four series running from 1992 to 1995 . In 1995 , the show was nominated for the Gouden Televizier Ring , an award for the best television programme in the Netherlands . All four series of the show have been released on DVD there . Die Wache : German interpretation of the series . As decent script-writers were hard to find at the time , the German producers were given the licence to utilise ( re-use ) scripts from the British series . The series was produced by RTL Television , running for nearly 750 episodes from 1994 to 2006 . Burnside : Spin-off from the main British series , following ex-DI Frank Burnside in his transfer and promotion to the National Crime Squad . The programme lasted for just a single series of six episodes , debuting in the UK on 6 July 2000 . The series was created and produced by Richard Handford . On 8 October 2008 , the series was released on DVD in Australia in a three-disc-set . MIT : Murder Investigation Team : Spin-off from the main British series . Lasting for two series , the drama began with a group of MIT officers investigating the drive-by shooting of Sgt. Matthew Boyden , who had been at Sun Hill for eleven years . The first series consisted of eight one-hour episodes . The second series consisted of four ninety-minute episodes . The series was created by Paul Marquess , produced by Johnathan Young and starred ex-Bill DS Eva Sharpe ( Diane Parish ) . = = Merchandise = = = = = VHS and DVD = = = = = = Books = = = = = = = Novels = = = = = = = Music = = = = = = Event merchandising = = =",

                    "text": "Doctor Who ( series 5 ) = The fifth series of British science fiction television programme Doctor Who began on 3 April 2010 with \" The Eleventh Hour \" and ended with \" The Big Bang \" on 26 June 2010 . The series was led by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat , who took over after Russell T Davies , who ended his involvement with the show after The End of Time . The series comprises 13 episodes , six of which Moffat wrote . Piers Wenger and Beth Willis served with Moffat as executive producers , while Tracie Simpson and Peter Bennett served as producers . Though it is the fifth series since the show 's revival in 2005 and the thirty-first since it began in 1963 , the largely new production team led to the series production codes being reset . This is the first series to feature Matt Smith as the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor , an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS , which appears to be a British police box on the outside . It also introduces Karen Gillan as the Doctor 's new companion Amy Pond and Arthur Darvill as her fianc\u00e9 Rory Williams , who is in seven episodes and travels with the Doctor and Amy . Alex Kingston returns as River Song , a mysterious woman from the Doctor 's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series . The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes , sometimes going unnoticed by the characters . It is discovered that they have the power to erase things from existence , and this happens to Rory , causing Amy to forget him . In the series finale it is revealed that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to the state which it was in without the cracks . The seven episodes of the series which were not written by Moffat were penned by guest writers . Mark Gatiss , Toby Whithouse , Simon Nye , Richard Curtis , Gareth Roberts each wrote one episode each , while Chris Chibnall wrote a two-episode story . The series was meant to be fantastical to stand out among other science fiction and fantasy shows and the production team pushed a fairy-tale quality because Moffat believed media aimed at children was some of the most popular among adults . The episodes were directed by directors who were all new to Doctor Who . Filming started in late July 2009 and lasted for approximately nine months and was filmed mostly in Wales with the exception of \" The Vampires of Venice \" and \" Vincent and the Doctor \" , which had scenes filmed abroad in Trogir , Croatia . There were design changes from the previous series including a new logo , title sequence , variation of the theme music , interior and exterior of the TARDIS , and version of the Doctor 's sonic screwdriver . The series premiere was watched by 10.085 million viewers , the highest watched premiere since \" Rose \" of the first series , and also broke records on BBC America in the United States and BBC 's online iPlayer . Though overnight ratings had declined compared to other series , one writer calculated that viewership had not changed significantly when time-shifted ratings were taken into account . The series received generally positive reviews , with praise going to Moffat 's story arc as well as the acting of Smith , Gillan and Darvill . However , many reviewers noted that Amy lacked character development and the series did not contain as much heart and emotion as previously in the show . The series gained many awards and nominations ; \" Vincent and the Doctor \" and the two-part finale were both nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) with the award going to the latter . Smith also became the first actor portraying the Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA award , though he did not win . The series was accompanied with a soundtrack as well as tie-in books and video games ; four of the latter were released episodically on the BBC 's website and advertised as additional episodes of the series . = = Episodes = = \" The Eleventh Hour \" , at 65 minutes , was the longest opening episode to date since the return of the series in 2005 . The two part story \" The Hungry Earth \" / \" Cold Blood \" saw the return of the Silurians for the first time since Warriors of the Deep in 1984 . = = = Supplemental episodes = = = Two additional scenes were specially filmed for \" The Complete Fifth Series \" boxset which reveal what occurred between selected regular episodes . The first installment is set between \" The Eleventh Hour \" and \" The Beast Below \" , while the second is set between \" Flesh and Stone \" and \" The Vampires of Venice \" . = = Casting = = The series introduced a new incarnation of the Doctor , the Eleventh , played by Matt Smith . This followed the departure of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor , who left the role to help ease the transition from Davies to Moffat 's showrunning . Smith 's agent had called him and suggested that he try out for the role . Moffat was looking to cast a middle-aged actor , who was \" young enough to run but old enough to look wise \" . However , Smith , who was only 26 when cast , was the third person to audition and the production team knew \" [ they ] had their man \" . The producers were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old actor could not play the Doctor adequately ; BBC Head of Drama and executive producer Piers Wenger shared the sentiment , but noted that Smith was capable enough to play the role . Moffat also stated that Smith did not appear to be youthful at all . Smith 's casting in the role was revealed during an episode of Doctor Who 's companion show Doctor Who Confidential , during which he described the role as \" a wonderful privilege and challenge that I hope I will thrive on \" . Karen Gillan was cast as Amy Pond , the Doctor 's companion . Andy Pryor , the casting director , suggested Gillan to Moffat after her performance in the fourth series episode \" The Fires of Pompeii \" , in which she played a soothsayer , but Moffat originally thought she was \" short and dumpy \" . Later , however , he stated that she was \" exactly right for the role \" though she portrayed the character differently from how he originally wrote . Gillan auditioned for the role in both her natural Scottish accent and an English one , and it was not until after she was cast that it was decided Amy would be Scottish . Gillan commented that she felt the Scottish accent better suited the character . For the first and last episodes , a young version of Amy , known as \" Amelia \" , was played by Gillan 's real-life 10-year-old cousin Caitlin Blackwood . Though the two actresses had not met until the set of the show , Gillan recommended Blackwood for the role , although Blackwood still had to undergo rigorous auditions first . Blackwood and Gillan did get to act together in \" The Big Bang \" , which Gillan initially found \" weird \" , though the two actresses became used to it quickly . Alex Kingston , who played the character River Song in the fourth series episodes \" Silence in the Library \" and \" Forest of the Dead \" , reprised her role in the two-part stories \" The Time of Angels \" / \" Flesh and Stone \" and \" The Pandorica Opens \" / \" The Big Bang \" . Kingston did not expect the return , but Moffat always intended for River to return to the series . Arthur Darvill appeared in seven episodes as Rory Williams , Amy Pond 's fianc\u00e9 , and was also a companion in six of those episodes . Darvill had previously worked with Smith on a play entitled Swimming with Sharks . For his audition , Darvill received two scenes from the first episode and one from the sixth , but beyond the fact Rory was Amy 's boyfriend he was not informed of details of the character . Moffat stated that what stood out about Darvill 's audition was \" just how funny \" he was . Darvill felt \" privileged \" to be part of the show , and was pleased with Rory 's storyline . Notable guest stars included James Corden , Annette Crosbie , Tony Curran , Iain Glen , Daisy Haggard , Terrence Hardiman , Toby Jones , Helen McCrory , Neve McIntosh , Ian McNeice , Stephen Moore , Bill Nighy , Sophie Okonedo , Bill Paterson , Meera Syal , and Nina Wadia . = = = Costumes = = = During the first episode , the Eleventh Doctor still wears his previous incarnation 's costume , but costume designer Ray Holman stated that the costume was broken down and distressed . Over the course of the first episode , he would find his own identity and pick out his defining costume . Smith tried on a wide variety of things to find a look he would feel comfortable and confident in and would identify his Doctor . Smith brought in braces and a tweed jacket ; Holman believed that the tweed jacket was \" a bit old for him \" but showed that he was a \" professor and student at the same time \" and gave him \" that quality that the Doctor 's still learning , but also has some authority \" . Smith suggested a bow tie , which Holman and others did not approve of , but once he had put it on they decided they had the costume . Smith stated he was inspired by the Second Doctor 's costume after watching The Tomb of the Cybermen . Other influences included the \" element of a professor \" and \" big , dusty boots like Indiana Jones \" . The men 's clothing store Topman reported that their bow tie sales had risen 94 % for the month of April 2010 , connected to when the series began airing . Gillan had substantial input into Amy 's costume , as well as her hair and make-up . In the first episode , Holman stated that Amy 's identity was not clear and she wore her own clothes later on . Gillan thought that Amy had inner confidence to wear clothes that showed \" a bit of skin from time to time \" . She tried on many things , but when it came to short skirts she \" just thought it was right \" and showed that Amy was \" comfortable and confident about her look \" . She believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age . Executive producer Piers Wenger also noted that Amy 's 1970s flying jacket , which she wears \" quite a lot \" , reflected Gillan was a \" born adventurer \" and Amy developed a love for travel and adventure . = = Production = = = = = Crew and series numbering = = = Doctor Who was renewed for a fifth series in September 2007 . Russell T Davies was succeeded by Steven Moffat as executive producer and head writer , and Julie Gardner was replaced as executive producer by Piers Wenger , who had previously replaced Gardner as Head of Drama for BBC Wales . Beth Willis also serves as an executive producer , and the series is produced by Tracie Simpson and Peter Bennett . However , Murray Gold stayed on as composer for the new series . When Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 , the new series was marketed as series 1 , although it had been on BBC television for 26 years from 1963 to 1989 . When this series was confirmed by the BBC in September 2007 , it was referred to as \" series 5 \" , following on from series 4 in 2008 . In August 2009 Doctor Who Magazine announced that this series was to be produced and marketed as \" Series One \" . The January 2010 edition featured an interview with Moffat , in which he called Series One \" exciting \" , Series Thirty-One \" awe-inspiring \" and Series Five \" boring and a lie \" . In the same issue , he jokingly referred to the season as \" series Fnarg \" , an ongoing joke in subsequent issues . The March edition , referring to it as Series Thirty-One , confirmed production codes in the range 1.1 to 1.13 . However , BBC Programme listings , the BBC iPlayer and DVDs refer to it as \" Series 5 \" . = = = Writing = = = With the changes to the show , Moffat wanted to reassure the audience that \" nothing has really been lost \" and it was the same show and the same character of the Doctor . The story arc of the cracks in the universe was inspired by a crack in the wall of Moffat 's son 's bedroom . Moffat wanted to make sure the show appealed to even young children ; if they could not follow the plot , there would be \" big pictures \" to entertain them . Moffat believed that Doctor Who was fundamentally for children but it was something everybody loved , comparing it to Star Wars and Toy Story . He considered the \" most popular form of entertainment \" to be a children 's story . Of the series , he said they \" pushed the fairytale side of it \" as Doctor Who \" now has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows \" to be more vibrant and \" bonkers \" than any other fantastical show . In an interview in 2013 , Moffat stated that he had worked out a rough idea for how his first series as the showrunner would work in the event that David Tennant had decided to stay in the show as the Tenth Doctor ; this would have entailed a similar premise to the beginning of \" The Eleventh Hour \" as broadcast ; Moffat wrote six episodes for the series . The rest were penned by guest writers , as Moffat believed that Doctor Who benefited from different voices . However , he stated that the concepts of the episodes were mostly supplied by him , as he had a \" pretty good idea \" of what would happen in each episode slot . Moffat knew all of the guest writers \" to some degree \" and called meeting with them \" quite joyous \" . However , Matthew Graham , co-creator of Life on Mars and writer of the second series episode \" Fear Her \" , was not able to write an episode as he was slated to because he did not believe he would have enough time . Moffat later contacted him and asked him to write a two-part episode for the next series , which became \" The Rebel Flesh \" / \" The Almost People \" . With the first episode , Moffat intended to introduce the Eleventh Doctor and have him establish his new identity while the second was intended to show the Doctor 's need for a companion and Amy 's importance to him . For the third episode , he asked Mark Gatiss to write an episode concerning \" Churchill versus the Daleks \" . Moffat wanted to incorporate the popular Daleks into the new series and was also considering redesigning them . Gatiss and Moffat as well as the production team worked together to create Daleks that were big and more colourful , similar to the Daleks found in the films of the 60s . For the fourth and fifth episode , Moffat planned a two-part sequel to his 2007 episode \" Blink \" , which featured the Weeping Angels . These two episodes , \" The Time of Angels \" and \" Flesh and Stone \" , were intended to be a more action-oriented than \" Blink \" , and also showed the Angels had a plan rather than scavenging . He also decided to flesh out the Angels as villains themselves and show more of what they can do . \" Flesh and Stone \" ends with Amy attempting to seduce the Doctor ; Moffat believed this was consistent with the character that had been built up from the first episode . Toby Whithouse originally planned to write a different episode , but Moffat and Wenger thought it was too similar to other episodes in the series and Whithouse wrote \" The Vampires of Venice \" instead , while his original episode was pushed to the next series . Whithouse was asked to write \" a big bold romantic episode \" that would be a \" good jumping off point \" for new viewers to Doctor Who . Moffat figured that in the middle of the series a viewer could \" start watching it again \" and that it should be \" something romantic and funny \" . For the next episode , Moffat asked comedy writer Simon Nye to write a story that challenged the relationship between Amy and the Doctor . The episode , titled \" Amy 's Choice \" , was intended to be Amy 's decision between excitement with the Doctor or life with Rory . The scene in which Rory dies in the false reality was intended to be when Amy realised her feelings for him . Nye wanted to stress that Amy really did love Rory and he was not \" just a cypher boyfriend or fianc\u00e9 \" . Moffat contacted Chris Chibnall to write a two-part episode involving the Silurians , villains who had not appeared in the show for over 25 years . As the Silurians were not as well known as other monsters , Moffat instructed Chibnall to reintroduce them . The Silurians featured were intended to be a different branch than those previously seen and bore a different design , which used expensive facial prosthetics and eliminated their third eye . Richard Curtis , who had previously worked with Moffat in the 1999 Comic Relief special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death , was contacted by Moffat to return the favour and write an episode , which became \" Vincent and the Doctor \" . Curtis had the idea of an episode about van Gogh for \" a long while \" and was interested in the fact that van Gogh never knew he was famous . Gillan noted that there was a different approach and style to the episode , and it was more character-driven . Neil Gaiman had written an episode , but it was pushed to the next series due to budget constraints and was replaced with \" The Lodger \" instead . \" The Lodger \" was adapted from a comic strip of the same name writer Gareth Roberts had done for Doctor Who Magazine , although he said most of it started \" from scratch \" The story was inspired by wishing to see the Doctor in normal , every-day human circumstances , as well as Roberts ' enjoyment of stories set on Earth rather than in space . Roberts was interested in doing a television version of the story , but he never mentioned it . However , Moffat was a fan of the comic story and immediately asked to adapt it into an episode when he became showrunner . Aspects of the finale came to Moffat as he was planning the story arc for the series , though he left room to improvise as the story developed . \" The Big Bang \" ends with the wedding of Amy and Rory . Moffat stated that he had always intended for them to get married \" from the off \" . The finale also left many questions that would be answered with the next series , concerning the identity of River Song and \" The Silence \" which appeared to cause the TARDIS to explode . = = = Design changes = = = The series introduced a new logo , which was announced in October 2009 . According to the BBC , it is the eleventh version of the logo to front the show . Moffat stated that the insignia of \" DW \" in the shape of the TARDIS was \" something really new \" . The logo was incorporated in a new title sequence , which was not revealed to an audience outside of the BBC until first transmission of \" The Eleventh Hour \" ; prior press screenings and previews had used a variation of the previous sequence . Moffat wanted a new version of the theme tune , and composer Murray Gold wanted it to \" sound a bit reckless \" . The new variation , composed by Gold , incorporated a new melody played by electronic trumpets and a faster tempo . The new theme angered some fans , with the BBC receiving 70 complaints as of 18 April 2010 . In response , a Doctor Who spokesman stated , \" The arranger has made alterations to the music four times since 2005 , so change is nothing new . It is important for the regeneration of the show to keep revisiting the score while always retaining the haunting and ground-breaking essence of the original . \" A new TARDIS prop was used , featuring the St John Ambulance logo that had been used in the early days of the show as well as in the Peter Cushing films of the early 60s , of which Moffat was a fan . Moffat said it was one thing he \" really wanted to do \" and it was for \" no other reason than that [ he ] thought it was prettier \" and he wanted the St. John Ambulance sticker on the front . It is also a brighter blue like Cushing 's TARDIS . A new set of the interior of the TARDIS was also designed , which Moffat estimated was three times bigger than the previous set . Moffat did not decide to create the new interior specifically for the new Doctor , but the brief to the set designer was to create a design that would suit Smith 's Doctor . Though he loved the old set , Moffat thought it was time for a new one to \" surprise people \" , and believed that the spirit of a new era was to change everything . Piers Wenger said that it took \" quite a long time to get the design right \" and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking , as \" futuristic \" meant nothing to the Doctor . The set was designed by Edward Thomas . The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of \" The Eleventh Hour \" ; the Time Rotor on console had to be rebuilt due to the explosion special effects that were used in The End of Time . In \" The Eleventh Hour \" , the sonic screwdriver is destroyed , and a new version , featuring a green light and metal claws , was created . Smith liked to keep the prop with him at all times \" twirling it around and flicking it \" which resulted in him breaking four of them . The noise made by the screwdriver was added in post-production using a synthesizer . Moffat described the changes as starting with a \" clean slate \" which made sense after the previous cast and crew had left . = = = Filming = = = All of the directors of the series were new to Doctor Who . Moffat commented that he wanted to \" shake things up \" and it was \" never too early to get rid of the safety net . \" Adam Smith directed the first episode as well as the fourth and fifth . Andrew Gunn , Ashley Way , Jonny Campbell , Toby Haynes , and Catherine Morshead each directed two episodes . Filming of the series lasted approximately nine months . Production blocks were arranged as follows : When rehearsing episodes four and five , the first episodes to be produced , director Adam Smith suggested that Smith and Gillan \" have an adventure \" where they could experience something exciting and laugh and scream . He took them to a \" real white knuckle ride \" on a boat in Cardiff Bay . Filming began on 20 July 2009 on Southerndown beach , Vale of Glamorgan in scenes for \" The Time of Angels \" and \" Flesh and Stone \" . Moffat wrote that typically with television the first day of filming \" will probably be something fairly inconsequential and involve a minor character getting shot , or a close up of a hand or something \" which differed from the \" iconic \" scene involving the Doctor , Amy , River Song and the TARDIS . Forest scenes in \" Flesh and Stone \" were filmed at Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean over nine nights in July 2009 . Episodes two and three made up the second production block . Scenes in \" The Beast Below \" were filmed in an orangery at Margam Country Park , Port Talbot during a night shoot on 22 September 2009 . Half of a scene in \" The Pandorica Opens \" featuring Liz 10 ( Sophie Okonedo ) from \" The Beast Below \" was filmed there as well . Scenes for Amy and Rory 's town of Leadworth in the first episode , \" The Eleventh Hour \" , were filmed in the village of Llandaff in Cardiff over various dates in the autumn of 2009 : 29 September , 5 \u2013 7 October , and 20 November . The fourth production block , consisting of \" The Hungry Earth \" and \" Cold Blood \" , was filmed in October and November 2009 with location filming done in Llanwynno , Wales . Scenes for \" Cold Blood \" were also filmed at the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009 as well as in Cardiff 's Temple of Peace and other locations and unusual sets for the Silurian city . \" The Vampires of Venice \" and \" Vincent and the Doctor \" were filmed mainly in the town of Trogir in Croatia , which was used as Venice and Paris respectively . However , a small crew did go to Venice to take wide shots of coastal buildings ; the episode was not filmed there because it would take too long to cover up the modern shops in present-day Venice . Scenes in \" The Vampires of Venice \" were also filmed at Atlantic College , Caerphilly Castle , Castell Coch , the Town Hall of Trogir , and Llancaich Fawr Manor . The grounds for the estate at Margam Country Park was then used for the placement of \" Foamhenge \" , a lightweight replica of Stonehenge for \" The Pandorica Opens \" . Several other scenes from \" The Pandorica Opens \" and \" The Big Bang \" were also filmed there during the first few days of February 2010 . The Pandorica chamber was filmed on set in the Upper Boat Studios , the largest set ever built there . Additional scenes in \" The Big Bang \" were filmed in Brangwyn Hall and Miskin Manor . \" Amy 's Choice \" was partially filmed in Skenfrith , Wales to represent \" Upper Leadworth \" . = = Promotion = = The first trailer for the fifth series was shown on television and released online shortly after the broadcast of the second part of The End of Time on 1 January 2010 . On 17 February , a new promotional image was released . A second teaser trailer was released on 20 February , a 3D version of which was shown in cinemas with Alice in Wonderland . Moffat officially confirmed the start date of 3 April on BBC Breakfast on 19 March . Also on 19 March , a trailer shown at the press screening of episode one was released online .

The commentaries were a departure from the previous releases , as it only had six instead of a full thirteen . = = Reception = = = = = Ratings = = = Final consolidated viewing figures showed that the premiere , \" The Eleventh Hour \" , was watched by 10.085 million viewers , the highest-watched premiere since \" Rose \" and the eighth highest figure for an episode of Doctor Who since it was revived in 2005 . In the US , the first episode set a record for BBC America , with an average of 1.2 million viewers and 0.9 million in the adults aged 25 \u2013 54 demographic . Within one week of broadcast , \" The Eleventh Hour \" received 1.27 million hits on BBC 's online iPlayer service , the record for most requests in a week . It went on to become the most requested episode of 2010 with 2.2 million views ; Doctor Who was also named the most watched programme of the year on the service . \" The Hungry Earth \" received the lowest overnight ratings since the series had returned in 2005 with 4.4 million viewers but in terms of final consolidated ratings , \" The Lodger \" received the lowest of the series . The episodes were also given an Appreciation Index , a measure of how much the audience enjoyed the programme . The BBC considers a score 85 or above \" excellent \" ; \" Victory of the Daleks \" and \" Amy 's Choice \" were the only ones to come below that , with 84 . \" The Time of Angels \" and \" The Lodger \" both scored 87 , which was subsequently beaten by \" The Pandorica Opens \" ( 88 ) . The finale , \" The Big Bang \" , scored 89 , the highest for the series and for the four main channels on the day it was broadcast . Based on overnight ratings , the series was reported as averaging six million viewers , a drop of 1.2 million from the previous series . However , managers at the BBC claimed that overall viewing numbers had not declined as more people watched it online or after recording it . Stephen Bray of Den of Geek decided to \" put things straight \" and figured that , with final ratings taken into account of the first eleven episodes of the series ( the final two ratings not having been released when the article was published ) , the series averaged 7.8 million viewers , beating the average of all the episodes of the second series ( 7.5 million ) , the third series ( 7.7 million ) and the first eleven episodes of the fourth series ( 7.7 million ) . = = = Reviews = = = Series 5 has received generally positive reviews from critics . Matt Wales of IGN gave the entire series a \" great \" rating of 8.5 out of 10 , saying that it \" mightn 't have been perfect \" but rebooted the show \" with a burst of creative energy \" and \" got bold , exciting , witty , smart , home-grown event television back on the small screen \" . He praised Smith for \" [ dazzling ] with a performance that painted the Doctor as thoroughly alien \" and the \" effortless \" character development of the Doctor , but was more critical of the character of Amy Pond . He thought that she was \" thoroughly watchable \" with Gillan 's acting abilities and chemistry with Smith , but criticised the character for being \" frequently painted in largely two-dimensional strokes that made for a brash , sometimes irritating turn \" and the series as a whole for lacking \" heart to ground the elaborate sci-fi trimmings \" . Of the story , he praised Moffat 's \" beautifully conceived \" story arc and the complexities of the narrative . Zap2it 's Sam McPherson gave the series an A and thought it was the show 's strongest series since its revival in 2005 . He praised Smith and Gillan , though he noted that Amy did not have much character development , and considered Darvill \" might just be one of the best actors on television currently \" . However , he noted that most of the episodes took place on Earth or spaceships , and wished to see the Doctor , Amy and Rory \" branch out more in the future \" . Dave Golder of SFX gave the series four out of five stars , noting that it looked \" very promising \" though \" there was a tentative , slightly awkward feel to the series \" , similar to the first series . He also labelled Smith as \" magnificent \" and Gillan as \" lovely , although so far Amy 's character has been so dictated by the requirements of the arc plot that it 's difficult to feel that we 've really got to know her yet \" . In a review of the first six episodes , Dan Martin of The Guardian thought that they were strong and it was \" generally funnier [ and ] appears to have rewritten the rule that said Doctor Who had to out-epic itself every year \" . However , he was critical of the lack of emotion that had previously inhibited the show , and did not yet empathise with Amy . When reviewing the first eleven episodes , Martin noted that the series had been put at a high expectation due to the quality of Moffat 's previous Doctor Who episodes , which may have caused disappointment to those who expected \" dark , adult versions of Who every week \" as Moffat took more of a fairy-tale approach and his dialogue was \" less soapy and more spiky \" than that of Davies . Revisiting previous issues , he noted that there was less emotion but \" when someone did die ... it ploughed heavy into the heart \" and Amy was \" a revelation \" , though she sometimes \" felt a little one-note \" . Gem Wheeler of Den of Geek gave the series five out of five stars , particularly praising Smith 's Doctor . Wheeler noted that Amy \" seemed a little underwritten at first , but the series finale helped to fill in the apparent gaps in her personality \" and also praised Darvill . Slice of SciFi reviewer Michael Hickerson praised Moffat 's \" fascinating \" story arc which made the series seem more consistent , as it gave the audience answers as it went along and also explored its impact on the characters . He called it \" the best season of the new series \" though \" there has yet to be a perfect season of the show . This one just comes closer than a lot of others \" . However , Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph , while optimistic that it would \" go from strength to strength next year \" , called the series \" something of a curate 's egg , and perhaps not quite as strong as previous years overall \" . Radio Times 's Patrick Mulkern praised Moffat for \" [ rebooting ] the series with an ambitious game-plan , a delightful fairy-tale vibe adults can enjoy too , and [ finding ] stars in Matt Smith , Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill \" . However , while he praised Moffat 's other episodes , he considered \" The Beast Below \" a \" turkey \" . The A.V. Club ranked Doctor Who the 25th best show of 2010 , saying that it \" lacked a truly weak episode \" and highlighting \" The Time of Angels \" / \" Flesh and Stone \" , \" Vincent and the Doctor \" , and \" The Lodger \" as the best episodes . Digital Spy ranked the programme the third best of 2010 , commenting that it \" gave us some terrific episodes \u2014 the beautifully tragic ' Vincent and the Doctor ' , the wonderfully-paced opener and the well-imagined finale ... but also the multi-colored monstrosity ' Victory of the Daleks ' . Overall , a decent enough start for the new team , but with such a strong pedigree , we couldn 't help but feel a little underwhelmed . \" = = = Criticism = = = After the broadcast of \" The Eleventh Hour \" , which introduced Amy as a kissogram in a skimpy policewoman outfit who watched the Doctor undress and change into his new costume , it was reported that several viewers had criticised the character and her occupation online and that it was \" not fitting for a family show \" . Wenger defended the character , saying that , \" The whole kissogram thing played into Steven 's desire for the companion to be feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number . Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with , but she isn 't promiscuous . \" Gillan also defended her character , claiming that girls Amy 's age often wore short skirts and Amy was a \" strong female \" and a \" normal girl with normal impulses \" . The BBC received 43 complaints over the scene in \" Flesh and Stone \" in which Amy attempts to seduce the Doctor . A member of pressure group Mediawatch-uk also commented that the scene seemed \" slightly out of place in a children 's programme \" . = = = Awards and nominations = = = \" Vincent and the Doctor \" and \" The Pandorica Opens \" / \" The Big Bang \" were nominated for the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) , with the award going to the latter . This was the fifth Hugo Award for Doctor Who and the fourth for Moffat , after \" The Empty Child \" / \" The Doctor Dances \" , \" The Girl in the Fireplace \" , and \" Blink \" . \" Vincent and the Doctor \" was nominated for the Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation at the 2010 Nebula Awards , but it lost to the film Inception .

On 22 April 2010 the first three , Apollo 23 by Justin Richards , Night of the Humans by David Llewellyn , and The Forgotten Army by Brian Minchin were released , featuring the Eleventh Doctor and Amy . On 8 July 2010 three more novels were released , Nuclear Time by Oli Smith , The Glamour Chase by Gary Russell , and The King 's Dragon by Una McCormack , each featuring the Doctor and Amy with Rory . Science fiction writer Michael Moorcock , who had watched Doctor Who since the beginning , also wrote a novel . Entitled The Coming of the Terraphiles , the novel was an extended 345 pages and was released 14 October 2010 . On 16 September 2010 , BBC Books released their first Doctor Who graphic novel , The Only Good Dalek , featuring the Doctor and Amy . They also released The Brilliant Book of Doctor Who 2011 , a guide to the series that featured behind-the-scenes information . The book was made available in the UK on 30 September 2010 . = = = Video games = = = In March 2010 , it was reported that Nintendo had signed a \u00a3 10 million contract for Doctor Who games for Wii and DS . The games were marketed to Nintendo as the brand was known for being family-oriented and the Wii in particular was something families played together . The BBC also was certain to monitor the games and make sure they did not contain anything too violent . Doctor Who : Evacuation Earth was released for the DS and featured the Daleks , whereas Doctor Who : Return to Earth featured the Cybermen and was released for the Wii . Both games featured the Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond , voiced by Smith and Gillan respectively . Evacuation Earth was released 12 November 2010 , while Return to Earth followed on 19 November . Additionally , Wii remotes and DS styluses modeled after the sonic screwdriver were released to accompany the games . In April 2010 , the BBC announced The Adventure Games , four interactive episodes available free-to-download on the BBC Doctor Who website featuring the Doctor and Amy voiced by Smith and Gillan . Piers Wenger referred to them as four extra episodes in the series and everything included was part of the Doctor Who universe . The game was developed by Charles Cecil and Sheffield-based game company Sumo , while the games were written by Phil Ford and James Moran and overseen by Moffat and the producers of the show . Cecil was contacted by BBC Wales Editor of Interactive Iain Tweedale , who asked him about developing a Doctor Who game . Smith and Gillan 's movements and actions were captured by rotoscoping . As the Doctor is a pacifist and did not use the guns commonly found in video games , The Adventure Games untilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay . Much of the first game was based around stealth , exploration , and puzzle-solving . The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver , but as this was often used as a skeleton key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver . The first installment , \" City of the Daleks \" , was originally scheduled to be released 5 June 2010 , but was made available two days earlier . The BBC explained the early release as a testing procedure , and final tweaks were expected to be made prior to official release . Within the first twelve days of availability , the game was downloaded over 500,000 times , and the traffic on the site had increased as a result . The second game , \" Blood of the Cybermen \" , was released on 26 June , after the airing of the series finale . This was followed by the third game , \" TARDIS \" , on 27 August and \" Shadows of the Vashta Nerada \" on 22 December . Additionally , a mobile game app was developed by Tag Games for BBC Worldwide . Titled \" Doctor Who : The Mazes of Time \" , it allowed the gamer to play as both the Doctor and Amy and involved time travel , defeating enemies , and solving problems . It featured over 100 puzzles , seven locations to travel to , music from the show , and the enemies being the Daleks , Cybermen , and Silurians . The app was released for Apple IOS devices on 16 December 2010 and for Android on 17 August 2011 .",

The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville series , all of which are completely independent of the television episodes . As of 2011 , Smallville 's Clark Kent has appeared in eighteen young adult novels . In the series , Clark Kent attempts to live the life of a normal human being , and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends . He has an on-again , off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons , the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret . In contrast to previous incarnations of the character , this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor , whom he meets after saving the latter 's life . The pair 's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another . In Smallville , Clark 's powers appear over time , as he is not aware of all of them at the start of the show ; for instance , his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six , respectively . When developing Smallville 's version of Clark Kent , the producers decided to strip him down to the \" bare essence \" of Superman ; he is also fallible , which allows the audience to see his humanity , but that he is also \" ... good to the core \" . In the series , he has been seen by critics , and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers , as a symbolic representation of Jesus Christ . Tom Welling has been nominated for multiple Teen Choice and Saturn Awards for his portrayal of Clark Kent since the show 's first season . = = Role in Smallville = = Clark Kent first appears in the pilot episode of Smallville as a teen with superhuman abilities that he uses to help others . Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent ( John Schneider and Annette O 'Toole ) as an infant , when he crash lands on Earth on the day of the Smallville meteor shower in 1989 . Twelve years later , trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father , Clark saves the life of Lex Luthor ( Michael Rosenbaum ) , the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor ( John Glover ) , and the pair become quick friends . During season one , Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him . In particular , he is afraid to open up to Lana Lang ( Kristin Kreuk ) for fear that she would not accept him if she learned of his supernatural abilities . In the season two episode \" Rosetta \" , Clark learns of his Kryptonian heritage , including his native language , his birth name ( Kal-El ) , and his birth father 's Jor-El ( Terence Stamp ) plan for him to rule the world . Fearful that he will not be able to control his own destiny , Clark runs away to Metropolis in the season two finale , leaving behind Lana , with whom he had started to develop a romantic relationship . In the season three premiere , three months later , Clark is brought home by Jonathan , who has agreed to allow Jor-El to take Clark at an undetermined time in the future . In the season three finale , a girl calling herself Kara arrives at the Kent farm and claims to be from Krypton . After Kara predicts that Clark 's friends are destined to leave or betray him , Clark decides to leave Smallville for good . When Jonathan attempts to intervene , Jor-El threatens to kill him . To save his adoptive father 's life , Clark agrees to go through with his decision to leave . In the season four premiere , Clark returns to Smallville . He has been \" reprogrammed \" by Jor-El to seek out the three stones of knowledge so he may fulfill his destiny . He meets Lois Lane ( Erica Durance ) , who is investigating the supposed death of her cousin , and Clark 's best friend , Chloe Sullivan ( Allison Mack ) . Clark , with help from his mother , regains control over his mind and consciously refuses to look for the stones . In the season four finale , a \" great evil \" is awakened in space after Clark defies Jor-El 's instructions and fails to obtain the three stones of knowledge . With a new meteor shower hitting Smallville , Clark finds the remaining stones and is transported to the Arctic , where the three stones create the Fortress of Solitude . In the season five premiere , Clark interrupts his training to return to Smallville , but when he fails to return to the Fortress before the Sun sets , he is stripped of his powers . In the episode \" Hidden \" , Clark begins an honest relationship with Lana , but is killed trying to save the town from a resident who hopes to kill all of the \" ... meteor freaks \" . Jor-El resurrects Clark , but warns him that someone he loves will eventually have to take his place . Clark worries about who will be sacrificed in return for him being saved . In the episode \" Reckoning \" , Lana is killed . Unwilling to accept this , Clark turns back time to save her . As a result , it is Clark 's adoptive father that becomes the sacrifice when he suffers a fatal heart attack . In the season five finale , Clark battles Brainiac ( James Marsters ) , a Kryptonian artificial intelligence in the form of a man . Clark fights to stop Brainiac from releasing the Kryptonian criminal Zod from the Phantom Zone . Clark fails , and becomes himself imprisoned in the Phantom Zone , while Zod escapes and sets out to conquer Earth . In the season six premiere , Clark escapes the Phantom Zone \u2014 inadvertently releasing several of the prisoners in the process \u2014 and returns to Smallville , where he fights and defeats Zod . The other Phantom Zone escapees become Clark 's primary focus in season six . He must also deal with Lana 's romantic relationship with Lex , which culminates in their engagement in the season six episode \" Promise \" . The season six finale reveals that the last of the Phantom Zone criminals is really a genetic experiment created by Kryptonian scientists . The escapee attacks Clark , cloning his DNA , and becomes Clark 's doppelg\u00e4nger . In the season seven premiere , Clark , together with John Jones ( Phil Morris ) , defeats his doppelg\u00e4nger . As the season continues , Clark discovers that a secret society known as Veritas was aware of his landing in Smallville during the first meteor shower and , moreover , possess a device that supposedly allows them to control him . In the season seven finale , Clark is confronted by Lex at the Fortress of Solitude . Lex has discovered Clark 's secret and possesses the Veritas device , which he uses , resulting in the Fortress collapsing on him and Clark . In the season eight premiere , it is revealed that the Veritas device does not allow others to control Clark , but rather strips him of his powers . Wandering the globe with Russian gangsters , Clark is eventually found and rescued by Oliver Queen ( Justin Hartley ) and John Jones , with the latter restoring Clarks powers . During season eight , Clark uses his new job at the Daily Planet to access advance information , which he uses to stop crime around the city . In subsequent episodes , Clark adopts the name \" Red-Blue Blur \" as his superhero moniker . Toward the end of the season , Clark wrestles with the idea of having to kill Davis Bloome ( Sam Witwer ) , a new friend , after discovering that Davis is actually Doomsday , a genetically engineered creature created by General Zod to kill Clark and destroy Earth . In the season eight finale , Clark finds a way to separate Davis ' personality from that of Doomsday , and buries Doomsday a mile underground . When Davis subsequently kills Jimmy Olsen ( Aaron Ashmore ) , Clark decides that his human-learned emotions have caused him the most trouble , as it was his compassion for Davis that led to Jimmy 's death . He vows that \" Clark Kent is dead \" . The start of season nine reveals that Clark has begun training with Jor-El , which is shown by his wearing his family crest on his chest when in his superhero persona . After realizing there are other Kryptonians on Earth , lacking special powers and led by Zod ( Callum Blue ) , Clark decides to help them adjust to living as humans . When Zod is shot and killed , Clark uses his own blood to bring him back to life , resulting in Zod regaining his Kryptonian powers . Zod enables the other Kryptonians to regain their powers as well , and unites them to destroy the world in order to turn it into a new Krypton . This season , Lois and Clark begin a romantic relationship , while Lois also assists \" The Blur \" in his heroic endeavors . Clark kisses Lois while he is \" the Blur \" in the season nine finale and unknowingly reveals to her the truth . Afterward , he convinces the Kryptonians to leave Earth for a new , uninhabited planet . Clark then sacrifices his own life to send Zod through a portal , far away from Earth . Season ten begins with Clark stuck in the afterlife , where Jor-El informs him that a great darkness is coming to Earth . Clark is unknowingly resurrected by Lois , who is now aware that he is \" the Blur \" . Jor-El also informs Clark that he is not ready to be Earth 's true savior , as there are inner demons that Clark must overcome first . In the episode \" Homecoming \" , Clark is visited by Brainiac 5 , who shows Clark how his past has shaped his present , and will one day shape his future ; including a vision of Clark 's future self when he has fully embraced his destiny . In the episode \" Isis \" , Clark reveals his secret to Lois only to find out that she already knew he was \" the Blur \" , which is followed in a later episode by Clark proposing to Lois . Clark realizes that in order to be the hero the world needs , he will have to step out of the shadows and into the light . As a result , Clark makes the decision to turn \" Clark Kent \" into a real disguise \u2014 opting to wear eyeglasses and alter his mannerisms to be more shy and reserved \u2014 so that the Blur does not have to hide his face to the world . By the series finale , the darkness , which is revealed to be Darkseid , arrives on Earth to enslave all of humanity . Clark realizes that his entire life has been one big trial by Jor-El ; accepting his true destiny , the Blur saves Earth from Darkseid 's coming Apokolips . The series ends by moving seven years into the future , where Clark and Lois are finally getting married , and Clark has embraced his new identity as \" Superman \" . Throughout the series , Clark gains and adjusts to new abilities , including X-ray vision in season one , heat vision in season two , and super hearing in season three . Clark unofficially flew in the season four premiere , when he was reprogrammed as \" Kal-El \" by his biological father , but upon regaining his memory he forgot how to use the ability . In season six , Clark gained his super breath . By the series finale , Clark learns to fly . Clark also discovers new vulnerabilities as the series progresses , including \" green meteor rocks \" or ( kryptonite ) , which he learns can weaken and potentially kill him . Various other forms of kryptonite appeared as the show continued , each with a different effect . Red kryptonite removed Clark 's inhibitions . Black kryptonite separated Clark 's Kryptonian personality from his human self , creating two distinct physical forms , and blue kryptonite stripped him of all supernatural abilities as long as it was in contact with him . Subsequent seasons also revealed that Clark could be vulnerable to alien weapons and magic . = = Portrayal = = In October 2000 , producers Al Gough and Miles Millar began their search for the three lead roles , and had casting directors in ten different cities looking at actors . After months of scouting , Tom Welling was cast as Clark Kent . Jensen Ackles , the runner up for the role of Clark Kent , would go on to play Jason Teague as a season four regular . Besides Welling , four other actors have portrayed Clark as young boy / teenager : Malkolm Alburquenque portrayed a three-year-old Clark in the pilot , and season two episode \" Lineage \" ; Brandon Fonseca played young Clark in the season five episode \" Vengeance \" ; and in the season eight episode \" Abyss \" , Jackson Warris would fill the role . In addition , in an alternate reality in the seventh season episode \" Apocalypse \" , a teenaged Clark Kent was portrayed by Brett Dier . The pilot director , David Nutter , was looking through pictures of actors and stumbled on Tom Welling 's image . When he asked about Welling , the casting director said Welling 's manager did not want him to do the role because it could hurt his feature film career . After a conversation with Welling 's manager , Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot , which convinced him to do the part . Welling 's initial fears were quelled after reading the script , when he realized that the show was not about Clark \" ... being a super hero ... , \" but more about the character attempting to live a normal life as a teenager . When Tom Welling auditioned for the role he was not sure how to prepare . While waiting for his turn , he realized that the character is one thing above all else : \" ... a high school kid .... \" To Welling , simply acting like he was a normal teenager , instead of like a super hero , was the perfect way to embody the character . Welling realized that by doing that , the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen . For one of his auditions , he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk ( the first actor to be cast for the show ) , and the network thought they had \" ... great chemistry \" . Welling was generally unfamiliar with the Superman mythology , so much so that when an episode of Lois & Clark : The New Adventures of Superman aired on television , which featured Clark learning about his Kryptonian heritage , Welling immediately turned the show off . According to Welling , he wanted to learn about Clark 's heritage simultaneously to Clark learning about it on Smallville . Welling believed that it was important for him to learn with the character , to help him be the Clark Kent envisioned by Al Gough and Miles Millar . The actor believed his lack of knowledge of the Superman mythology helped his performance , because Gough and Millar set up the series so that the previous mythology was not as important . Welling also enjoyed that he was in the same predicament as Clark with neither knowing the future of the character , beyond the fact that he will be Superman . When Welling landed the role of Clark Kent he was sent various Superman-related gifts , including books and toys , which Welling planned to leave unopened until the show was over . Welling was adamant from the beginning that he did not sign on to play Superman , and had no intention of wearing the costume . While filming , Welling was allowed input into how his character responded in certain situations , including moving the scene between rooms , or requesting the director film particular mannerisms to emphasize a specific emotion . = = Character development = = = = = Storyline progression = = = Early in the series , Clark was still learning how to handle his life , by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone . His main priority was to fit in with his friends at school and be an average guy . Initially , Clark 's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about . According to Welling , \" He is burdened with a lot of responsibility . He hasn 't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities . All this responsibility has just been thrust on him , and he has to deal with it . There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself , \u2018 Why me ? ' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal . That 's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play . \" Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day , but more about how using his powers \" ... alienate [ s ] him from others \" . Welling reasoned that by the end of season three , Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run . Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three : \" If you can 't fight them , you might as well join them [ ... ] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El . I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up . A lot of times in your life , you get to a point where you go , ' I just can 't fight this anymore . There 's nothing I can do about it , so I better get up out of bed and go to work ! ' And in a sense , that 's what Clark had to do . Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain \u2014 and everyone else so much pain \u2014 and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain , he could save them a lot of pain in the long run . \" A significant moment in the character 's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four , providing conflict between him and his father . Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a \" ... callback to [ Hothead ] ... \" in season one . To him , when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway , it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone . Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father 's shadow . Two more significant moments came during the following season . First , Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training ; leaving him human and vulnerable . According to Welling , \" ... [ Clark ] learned a little bit more about what it 's like to be human , physically . Emotionally , he 's pretty close to trying to understand that . It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back , and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has . \" The second moment came in the show 's 100th episode , with the death of Clark 's adoptive father . The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny , allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man , as explained by Gough . In order to do that he needed his mentor to die , so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer . Welling saw the series ' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow . John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark 's evolution . According to Schneider , Jonathan 's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny . Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark . To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman . It was Schneider 's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was , when the time came that the world needed Superman , Clark would have been unable to take on that persona , because he would not realize that the world needed him . Writer Holly Harold noted that the introduction of Green Arrow ( Justin Hartley ) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season . Clark was able to see how others achieved the same goals , but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines . This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents ' perspectives . Ultimately , in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be , summed up by writer Turi Meyer as \" ... soon-to-be Man of Steel \" . Each season , Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime . In later seasons , Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions , specifically Arthur Curry ( Alan Ritchson ) and Andrea Rojas ( Denise Qui\u00f1ones ) , though Clark did help them take the high road . Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark 's parents had on how he used his abilities . Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone , even though he chose not to join Oliver 's team of superheroes at the end of the episode \" Justice \" . For Meyer , season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny , but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman . = = = Characterization = = = The idea Gough and Millar came up with for their show 's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his \" ... bare essence ... \" , discovering the reasons why Clark became Superman . In Smallville , Clark is fallible , as Gough explains : The thing that we 've tried to portray ... is that Clark doesn 't always make the right decisions , and by not making the right decisions , he brings further consequences on himself . Whether it 's running away from Jor-El at the end of season two , or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission , those decisions get him in more trouble , and cause more people to suffer , or in Jonathan Kent 's case , to die . Welling agreed with Gough 's opinion of Clark 's fallibility , stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity . Even though Clark could make the wrong choices , season five 's \" Aqua \" helped illustrate the concept that Clark was \" ... good to the core \" . The episode showed how protective he could be over someone , even when that person annoyed him . In this case , he was trying to warn Lois that Arthur Curry may not have been the man she believed him to be . This concept was echoed by the Seattle Times ' Julia Waterhous , who noted that Clark , despite all his flaws , always put others before himself . Welling 's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character . Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad , lonely , but also endearing ; whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a special needs child . Just like his comic book counterpart , Smallville 's Clark Kent was a symbolic representation of Jesus Christ . Established early on , the pilot episode contained a moment when Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing . The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 's Rob Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene , stating , \" Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman , too , was ' sent to save us ' ? \" Echoing Owen , Judge Byun identified the same symbolism : \" Superman is , in a way , the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ , a messiah figure for our generation . The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode , in which Clark is symbolically ' crucified ' in a cornfield . That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series ; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity , and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role . \" This was extended to the end of season nine , where Clark sacrificed his own life in the finale , in order to send General Zod and the rest of the Kandorians to their own world . In doing so , Clark fell off a building \" ... in full crucifixion pose , driving home the point that he is sacrificing himself for the good of the planet \" . To this point , Cinefantastique 's Tom Powers suggested that these images and metaphorical emphasis through dialogue exchanges came across so heavy-handed that a very devout individual might have found them offensive . In addition to religious allusions , the crew used color schemes and camera movements to create their own themes for the characters . Since the show was told from Clark 's point of view , particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic . When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle , with an earth tone , while the camera movement was gentle as well . When Clark was keeping his secret , but there was no danger around , the lighting was more neutral , with greater camera movement . When there was danger , the lighting became colder with more grays and blues , and the camera shifted to a handheld , allowing more extreme angles . = = = Relationships = = = Clark 's relationships with the other characters evolved over the course of the show . Clark 's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic , as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship . In the pilot , Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident ; at the end of the episode , Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite . His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty , just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons ; the same could be said for Lex 's dishonesty with Clark . Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other , but knew they could not , which inhibited their friendship . His relationship with Lana Lang was one of Smallville 's central relationships . When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery , Clark realized that he had found someone who understood him , who he could talk to , even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked . Although Clark felt close to Lana , his fear that she would \" ... kick him out of her life ... \" if she learned his secret \u2014 that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents \u2014 was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished . The lack of honesty caused issues between them . Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life , as the he bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season . With Lana 's boyfriend gone by season two , the door opened for Clark , but Welling stated he understood why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart , even after Whitney 's departure : \" There 's the clich\u00e9 that television shows with a main lover interest fail once they get it together . \" After briefly being together at the beginning of the fifth season , Clark 's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five . Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way , but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana 's safety in jeopardy . Apart from that , Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero . His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six . This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex 's marriage proposal . For writer Kelly Souders , this presented Clark 's worst fear : the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy . Apart from Lana , Clark had a growing relationship with Lois . Season five saw the melting of the ice between the two characters , who continued to butt heads . Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two , and the fact that both would be there for the other in a time of need . Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five , because of her self-imposed walls , laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark , even if that notion was true . In season six , Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on . Instead , Durance believed that , by that point in the series , Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a \" brother and sister friendship \" label , rather than trying to discover how each truly feels . By season eight , Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life . His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guide 's list of the best TV couples of all time . = = = Costume = = = For most of the series , Clark did not wear any sort of costume when in his superhero persona . From seasons one through eight , Clark was typically dressed in either red , yellow and blue ( the traditional colors of the Superman costume ) , or in the All-American colors of red , white , and blue . This included the primary usage of either a blue t-shirt underneath a red jacket , or a red t-shirt worn under a blue jacket . In season nine , the producers decided to design an actual costume for Clark to wear while patrolling the streets of Metropolis . Abandoning the theme of red , blue , and yellow , the producers chose to keep the costume completely black , save for a silver Superman \" S \" shield painted on the front . Instead of the traditional cape , Clark 's red jacket is traded for a black trenchcoat . This drew comparison to the character of Neo from The Matrix film series . It was also compared to the black suit Superman wore after being resurrected , following his death at the hands of Doomsday in the comic books . In the season ten premiere , the audience got its first glimpse of the traditional Superman costume , which was left for Clark by Martha in the season nine finale . Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark 's eyes in the season nine finale , the suit that appeared in the season ten premiere was a different design . The producers , working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics , procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns , which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s . DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve , but Peterson explained that it \" ... just didn 't quite fit with our world . \" According to producer Kelly Souders , \" Well , the process was really a group effort . We worked with DC , and we have Alicia Louis , who does a lot of stuff for us at the studio , and who was really instrumental . It took quite a bit to get that costume . There 's a lot of sign-offs , it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen . \" Peterson stated that the costume plays a more prominent role in the final season , with the last scene of Smallville ending with Clark wearing it . Before then , Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode \" Shield \" . Here , Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket , and the \" S \" shield now embossed onto the chest of that jacket . = = Reception = = In 2002 , Welling was nominated for his first Saturn Award for Best Actor in a Television series , for his portrayal of Clark Kent in Smallville . Following that , Welling was nominated another four consecutive years , 2003 to 2006 , for the Saturn Award for Best Actor in a Television series . The same year he was nominated for his first Saturn Award , Welling won a Teen Choice Award for Choice Breakout TV Star , Male . Although he has not won a Teen Choice Award since , just like with the Saturn Awards , he has been nominated for Choice Actor in television for the four consecutive years after his win , 2003 to 2006 , Although not nominated in 2007 , he did receive a nomination in 2008 and 2009 for Choice Male in an Action / Adventure series . Welling was also nominated for the 2006 Teen Choice Awards for Most Beautiful Couple ( TV \u2014 Choice Chemistry ) , with his co-star Kristin Kreuk . In the 2009 Teen Choice Awards , Tom Welling received the award for Choice TV Actor \u2014 Action Adventure . Welling was included in TV Guide 's list of \" TV 's Sexiest Crime Fighters \" . Bryan Byun , of DVD Verdict , believes that Welling was the perfect choice for Clark Kent : \" I can 't imagine a more ideal actor to play this superpowered farm boy than Tom Welling , with his wholesome , honest face and heroic good looks \u2014 Welling not only resembles Christopher Reeve physically , but has all of the earnest charm that made Reeve the quintessential Superman . \" The Free Lance \u2013 Star 's Ron Hedelt likened Welling 's performances as Clark Kent to that of Christopher Reeve 's performances in the Superman films , stating that Welling manages to portray a \" ... sweet , unassuming teenager ... \" while showing Clark struggle with the truth about himself . Comics2Film 's Rob Worley also wrote of the physical resemblance Welling has to Christopher Reeve , noting that the actor gave the character depth with his convincing portrayal of Clark 's longing to fit in . When comparing Smallville 's Clark Kent to Bryan Singer 's Superman ( Brandon Routh ) in Superman Returns , Seattle Times ' Julia Waterhous found Smallville 's Clark Kent to be the more intriguing character . Waterhous explained that this was due to the inner turmoil of Clark \u2014 not being able to tell those he loved his secret \u2014 and the fact that no matter what his faults were he continued to put others before himself , remaining \" ... pure and good ... \" . She explained that this allowed the audience to become intimate with the character , something lacking in the film version . According to the Associated Press , Welling 's popularity as Clark Kent on Smallville had fans of the show wishing he would take the role Routh received in Superman Returns . = = Other media appearances = = = = = Young Adult novels = = = Smallville 's Clark Kent has also appeared in two series of young adult novels .

Parallel to the main story arc , other story arcs featuring other characters ( many of which were part of the future \" Justice League America \" ) were released online every fourth Friday , and collected and printed in special editions by themselves , separate from the main story . Written by Bryan Q. Miller , who wrote for the television series , the comic took up the story of the Smallville characters six months after The Blur saved Earth from the Apokolips . Clark no longer fights crime by the alias The Blur , but has been dubbed Superman by the masses . During the season Clark continued his battles with Lex Luthor , who had lost his memory .

                    "text": "Matt Groening = Matthew Abram \" Matt \" Groening ( / \u02c8\u0261re\u026an\u026a\u014b / GRAY-ning ; born February 15 , 1954 ) is an American cartoonist , writer , producer , animator , and voice actor . He is the creator of the comic strip Life in Hell ( 1977 \u2013 2012 ) and the television series The Simpsons ( 1989 \u2013 present ) and Futurama ( 1999 \u2013 2003 , 2008 \u2013 2013 ) . The Simpsons has gone on to become the longest running U.S. primetime television series in history , as well as the longest running animated series and sitcom . Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of Life in Hell to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978 . At its peak , the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers . Life in Hell caught the attention of James L. Brooks . In 1985 , Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show . Originally , Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show . Fearing the loss of ownership rights , Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family , the Simpson family , and named the members after his own parents and sisters \u2014 while Bart was an anagram of the word brat . The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons , which has since aired 596 episodes . In 1997 , Groening and former Simpsons writer David X. Cohen developed Futurama , an animated series about life in the year 3000 , which premiered in 1999 , running for four years on Fox , then picked up by Comedy Central for additional seasons . Groening has won 12 Primetime Emmy Awards , ten for The Simpsons and two for Futurama as well as a British Comedy Award for \" outstanding contribution to comedy \" in 2004 . In 2002 , he won the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award for his work on Life in Hell . He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 14 , 2012 . = = Early life = = Groening was born on February 15 , 1954 in Portland , Oregon , the middle of five children ( older brother Mark and sister Patty were born in 1950 and 1952 , while the younger sisters Lisa and Maggie in 1956 and 1958 , respectively ) . His Norwegian-American mother , Margaret Ruth ( n\u00e9e Wiggum ; March 23 , 1919 \u2013 April 22 , 2013 ) , was once a teacher , and his German American father , Homer Philip Groening ( December 30 , 1919 \u2013 March 15 , 1996 ) , was a filmmaker , advertiser , writer and cartoonist . Homer , born in Main Centre , Saskatchewan , Canada , grew up in a Mennonite , Plautdietsch-speaking family . Matt 's grandfather , Abram Groening , was a professor at Tabor College , a Mennonite Brethren liberal arts college in Hillsboro , Kansas before moving to Albany College ( now known as Lewis and Clark College ) in Oregon in 1930 . Groening grew up in Portland , and attended Ainsworth Elementary School and Lincoln High School . From 1972 to 1977 , Groening attended The Evergreen State College in Olympia , Washington , a liberal arts school that he described as \" a hippie college , with no grades or required classes , that drew every weirdo in the Northwest . \" He served as the editor of the campus newspaper , The Cooper Point Journal , for which he also wrote articles and drew cartoons . He befriended fellow cartoonist Lynda Barry after discovering that she had written a fan letter to Joseph Heller , one of Groening 's favorite authors , and had received a reply . Groening has credited Barry with being \" probably [ his ] biggest inspiration . \" He first became interested in cartoons after watching the Disney animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians , and he has also cited Peanuts and its creator Charles M. Schulz as inspirations . = = Career = = = = = Early career = = = In 1977 , at the age of 23 , Groening moved to Los Angeles to become a writer . He went through what he described as \" a series of lousy jobs , \" including being an extra in the television movie When Every Day Was the Fourth of July , busing tables , washing dishes at a nursing home , clerking at the Hollywood Licorice Pizza record store , landscaping in a sewage treatment plant , and chauffeuring and ghostwriting for a retired Western director . = = = Life in Hell = = = Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of the self-published comic book Life in Hell , which was loosely inspired by the chapter \" How to Go to Hell \" in Walter Kaufmann 's book Critique of Religion and Philosophy . Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza , a record store in which he worked . He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978 . The strip , titled \" Forbidden Words , \" appeared in the September / October issue of that year . Groening had gained employment at the Los Angeles Reader , a newly formed alternative newspaper , delivering papers , typesetting , editing and answering phones . He showed his cartoons to the editor , James Vowell , who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper . Life in Hell made its official debut as a comic strip in the Reader on April 25 , 1980 . Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column , \" Sound Mix , \" in 1982 . However , the column would rarely actually be about music , as he would often write about his \" various enthusiasms , obsessions , pet peeves and problems \" instead . In an effort to add more music to the column , he \" just made stuff up , \" concocting and reviewing fictional bands and non-existent records . In the following week 's column , he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true . Eventually , he was finally asked to give up the \" music \" column . Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer , who would later become a voice on The Simpsons . Life in Hell became popular almost immediately . In November 1984 , Deborah Caplan , Groening 's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the Reader , offered to publish \" Love is Hell \" , a series of relationship-themed Life in Hell strips , in book form . Released a month later , the book was an underground success , selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings . Work is Hell soon followed , also published by Caplan . Soon afterward , Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life in Hell Co . , which handled merchandising for Life in Hell . Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate , which syndicated Life in Hell , Lynda Barry and John Callahan , but now only syndicates Life in Hell . At the end of its run , Life in Hell was carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books , including School is Hell , Childhood is Hell , The Big Book of Hell , and The Huge Book of Hell . Although Groening has stated , \" I 'll never give up the comic strip . It 's my foundation , \" he announced that the June 16 , 2012 strip would mark Life in Hell 's conclusion . After Groening ended the strip , the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work . The poster contained tribute cartoons by 22 of Groening 's cartoonist friends who were influenced by Life in Hell . = = = The Simpsons = = = = = = = Creation = = = = Life in Hell caught the eye of Hollywood writer-producer and Gracie Films founder James L. Brooks , who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt . In 1985 , Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation on an undefined future project , which would turn out to be developing a series of short animated skits , called \" bumpers , \" for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show . Originally , Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show . Groening feared that he would have to give up his ownership rights , and that the show would fail and would take down his comic strip with it . Groening conceived of the idea for The Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks 's office and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family : Homer , the overweight father ; Marge , the slim mother ; Bart , the bratty oldest child ; Lisa , the intelligent middle child ; and Maggie , the baby . Groening famously named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family : his parents , Homer and Margaret ( Marge or Marjorie in full ) , and his younger sisters , Lisa and Margaret ( Maggie ) . Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself , he chose the name \" Bart , \" an anagram of brat . However , he stresses that aside from some of the sibling rivalry , his family is nothing like the Simpsons . Groening also has an older brother and sister , Mark and Patty , and in a 1995 interview Groening divulged that Mark \" is the actual inspiration for Bart. \" Maggie Groening has co-written a few Simpsons books featuring her cartoon namesake . = = = = The Tracey Ullman Show = = = = The family was crudely drawn , because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators , assuming they would clean them up ; instead , they just traced over his drawings . The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette . When Groening originally designed Homer , he put his own initials into the character 's hairline and ear : the hairline resembled an ' M ' , and the right ear resembled a ' G ' . Groening decided that this would be too distracting though , and redesigned the ear to look normal . He still draws the ear as a ' G ' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans . Marge 's distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s , although her hair was never blue . Bart 's original design , which appeared in the first shorts , had spikier hair , and the spikes were of different lengths . The number was later limited to nine spikes , all of the same size . At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and \" not thinking that [ Bart ] would eventually be drawn in color \" gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head . Lisa 's physical features are generally not used in other characters ; for example , in the later seasons , no character other than Maggie shares her hairline . While designing Lisa , Groening \" couldn 't be bothered to even think about girls ' hair styles \" . When designing Lisa and Maggie , he \" just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style , not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color \" . Groening storyboarded and scripted every short ( now known as The Simpsons shorts ) , which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer , both of whom would later become directors on the series . The Simpsons shorts first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 , 1987 . Another family member , Grampa Simpson , was introduced in the later shorts . Years later , during the early seasons of The Simpsons , when it came time to give Grampa a first name , Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather , Abraham Groening , leaving it to other writers to choose a name . By coincidence , they chose Abraham , unaware that it was the name of Groening 's grandfather . = = = = Half-hour = = = = Although The Tracey Ullman Show was not a big hit , the popularity of the shorts led to a half-hour spin-off in 1989 . A team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company . The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house . James L. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show 's content . Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called \" the mainstream trash \" that they were watching . The half-hour series premiered on December 17 , 1989 with \" Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire \" , a Christmas special . \" Some Enchanted Evening \" was the first full-length episode produced , but it did not broadcast until May 1990 , as the last episode of the first season , because of animation problems . The series quickly became a worldwide phenomenon , to the surprise of many . Groening said : \" Nobody thought The Simpsons was going to be a big hit . It sneaked up on everybody . \" The Simpsons was co-developed by Groening , Brooks , and Sam Simon , a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects . Groening and Simon , however , did not get along and were often in conflict over the show ; Groening once described their relationship as \" very contentious . \" Simon eventually left the show in 1993 over creative differences . Like the main family members , several characters from the show have names that were inspired by people , locations or films . The name \" Wiggum \" for police chief Chief Wiggum is Groening 's mother 's maiden name . The names of a few other characters were taken from major street names in Groening 's hometown of Portland , Oregon , including Flanders , Lovejoy , Powell , Quimby and Kearney . Despite common fan belief that Sideshow Bob Terwilliger was named after SW Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland , he was actually named after the character Dr. Terwilliker from the film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. Although Groening has pitched a number of spin-offs from The Simpsons , those attempts have been unsuccessful . In 1994 , Groening and other Simpsons producers pitched a live-action spin-off about Krusty the Clown ( with Dan Castellaneta playing the lead role ) , but were unsuccessful in getting it off the ground . Groening has also pitched \" Young Homer \" and a spin-off about the non-Simpsons citizens of Springfield . In 1995 , Groening got into a major disagreement with Brooks and other Simpsons producers over \" A Star Is Burns \" , a crossover episode with The Critic , an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former Simpsons crew members . Groening claimed that he feared viewers would \" see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise The Critic at the expense of The Simpsons , \" and was concerned about the possible implication that he had created or produced The Critic . He requested his name be taken off the episode . Groening is credited with writing or co-writing the episodes \" Some Enchanted Evening \" , \" The Telltale Head \" , \" Colonel Homer \" and \" 22 Short Films About Springfield \" , as well as The Simpsons Movie , released in 2007 . He has had several cameo appearances in the show , with a speaking role in the episode \" My Big Fat Geek Wedding \" . He currently serves at The Simpsons as an executive producer and creative consultant . = = = Futurama = = = After spending a few years researching science fiction , Groening got together with Simpsons writer / producer David X. Cohen ( still known as David S. Cohen at the time ) in 1997 and developed Futurama , an animated series about life in the year 3000 . By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998 , Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and storylines ; Groening claimed they had gone \" overboard \" in their discussions . Groening described trying to get the show on the air as \" by far the worst experience of [ his ] grown-up life . \" The show premiered on March 28 , 1999 . Groening 's writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode , \" Space Pilot 3000 \" ( co-written with Cohen ) , \" Rebirth \" ( story ) and \" In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela \" ( story ) . After four years on the air , the show was canceled by Fox . In a situation similar to Family Guy , however , strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought Futurama back to life . When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air Futurama reruns , Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes . When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes , it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films \u2014 Bender 's Big Score ( 2007 ) , The Beast with a Billion Backs ( 2008 ) , Bender 's Game ( 2008 ) and Into the Wild Green Yonder ( 2009 ) \u2014 would be produced . Since no new Futurama projects were in production , the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale . However , Groening had expressed a desire to continue the Futurama franchise in some form , including as a theatrical film . In an interview with CNN , Groening said that \" we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them , but I don 't know ... We 're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can 't tell if it 's just me . \" Comedy Central commissioned an additional 26 new episodes , and began airing them in 2010 . The show continued in to 2013 , before Comedy Central announced in April 2013 that they would not be renewing it beyond its seventh season . The final episode aired on September 4 , 2013 . = = = Other pursuits = = = In 1994 , Groening formed Bongo Comics ( named after the character Bongo from Life in Hell ) with Steve Vance , Cindy Vance and Bill Morrison , which publishes comic books based on The Simpsons and Futurama ( including Futurama Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis , a crossover between the two ) , as well as a few original titles . According to Groening , the goal with Bongo is to \" [ try ] to bring humor into the fairly grim comic book market . \" He also formed Zongo Comics in 1995 , an imprint of Bongo that published comics for more mature readers , which included three issues of Mary Fleener 's Fleener and seven issues of his close friend Gary Panter 's Jimbo comics . Groening is known for his eclectic taste in music . His favorite band is Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention and his favorite album is Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart ( which was produced by Zappa ) . He guest-edited Da Capo Press 's Best Music Writing 2003 and curated a US All Tomorrow 's Parties music festival in 2003 . He illustrated the cover of Frank Zappa 's posthumous album Frank Zappa Plays the Music of Frank Zappa : A Memorial Tribute ( 1996 ) . In May 2010 , he curated another edition of All Tomorrow 's Parties in Minehead , England . He also plays the drums in the all-author rock and roll band The Rock Bottom Remainders ( although he is listed as the cowbell player ) , whose other members include Dave Barry , Ridley Pearson , Scott Turow , Amy Tan , James McBride , Mitch Albom , Roy Blount Jr . , Stephen King , Kathi Kamen Goldmark , Sam Barry and Greg Iles . In July 2013 , Groening co-authored Hard Listening ( 2013 ) with the rest of the Rock Bottom Remainders ( published by Coliloquy , LLC ) . On January 15 , 2016 , it was announced that Groening is in talks with Netflix to develop a new animated series . Netflix is considering giving the series a two-season order , totalling 20 episodes . = = Personal life = = Groening and Deborah Caplan married in 1986 and had two sons together , Homer ( who goes by Will ) and Abe , both of whom Groening occasionally portrays as rabbits in Life in Hell . The couple divorced in 1999 after thirteen years of marriage . In 2011 , Groening married Argentinian artist Agustina Picasso after a four-year relationship , and became stepfather to her daughter Camille . In May 2013 , Picasso gave birth to Nathaniel Philip Picasso Groening , named after writer Nathanael West . She joked that \" his godfather is SpongeBob 's creator Stephen Hillenburg \" . Matt is the brother-in-law of Hey Arnold ! and Dinosaur Train creator , Craig Bartlett , who is married to Groening 's sister , Lisa . Arnold used to appear in Simpsons Illustrated . Groening identifies himself as agnostic and a liberal and has often made campaign contributions to Democratic Party candidates .

                    "text": "Underbelly ( series 1 ) = Underbelly , the first series of Australian crime television drama series Underbelly . The thirteen-part series originally aired from 13 February 2008 to 7 May 2008 on the Nine Network and is loosely based on the real events of the 1995 \u2013 2004 gangland war in Melbourne . It depicts the key players in Melbourne 's criminal underworld , including the Carlton Crew and their rival , Carl Williams . The series is based on the book Leadbelly : Inside Australia 's Underworld , by journalists John Silvester and Andrew Rule , and borrows its name from the successful Underbelly true crime anthology book series also authored by Silvester and Rule . An alternative and significantly updated tie-in novel , Underbelly : The Gangland War , was released as their 13th book in the series . The series is produced by the Australian Film Finance Corporation , in association with Film Victoria . The executive producers are Des Monaghan and Jo Horsburgh . The lead-up to Underbelly involved a heavy marketing campaign which covered radio , print , billboards and an increased online presence , including the use of social networking tools . At a reported cost of $ 500,000 , both this marketing investment and potentially millions of dollars in advertising revenue were claimed to be put at risk by the Victorian Supreme Court 's injunction , as the series was expected to attract 800,000 to 1 million viewers in Victoria alone . The injunction was put in place to ensure that upcoming criminal trials were not unfair to the accused , because the series contained fictionalised re-enactments of several disputed events . Underbelly began screening on 13 February 2008 on the Nine Network in all states and territories except Victoria . An edited version of the series premiered in Victoria on 14 September 2008 after the injunction was partially lifted , although only the first five episodes were shown . In 2011 , the injunction was partially lifted and the series was screened as \" Underbelly : Uncut \" . This rebroadcast included scenes from the original DVD release , as well as several significant changes that were made to keep the show current , including a newly recorded final voiceover and the crediting of several characters that were previously uncredited ( allowable due to the ending of related trials ) . Some previously named characters in the final episode however are now unable to be named , resulting in a continued banning of the sale of the video release in Victoria . Underbelly was a critical and ratings success , being described as \" Australia 's best ever crime drama \" . Despite this critical success , the series has been the target of controversy due to its glamourised depiction of crime and violence . The opening double episodes , which aired on 13 February , attracted an average of 1,320,000 viewers nationally , minus Victoria . Every episode of the 13-part series was soon made available for download on a range of sites , with the Nine Network saying it was considering legal action . The legal DVD of Underbelly was released on 8 May 2008 , a day after the final episode was aired on television . Due to the legal suppression , the release was not able to be distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet . The ban remains in place in 2013 , due to legal issues involving the final episode of the show . It was the first in a continuing series , and was later followed by Underbelly : A Tale of Two Cities , Underbelly : The Golden Mile , Underbelly : Razor , Underbelly : Badness , Underbelly : Squizzy and the sequel to the first series Fat Tony & Co . , as well as three television films released as Underbelly Files . = = Synopsis = = = = = Overview = = = Underbelly is a fictionalised account of the events behind the Melbourne gangland war that lasted from 1995 until 2004 . In the first episode , the Carlton Crew crime syndicate is introduced , comprising stand-over man Alphonse Gangitano ( Vince Colosimo ) , Domenic \" Mick \" Gatto ( Simon Westaway ) , loanshark Mario Condello ( Martin Sacks ) , retired bank robber Graham Kinniburgh ( Gerard Kennedy ) and drug-dealing siblings Jason and Mark Moran ( Les Hill and Callan Mulvey ) and their father Lewis ( Kevin Harrington ) . Jason Moran 's seemingly harmless and half-witted driver Carl Williams ( Gyton Grantley ) is also introduced , along with two police characters ; Steve Owen ( Rodger Corser ) and Jacqui James ( Caroline Craig ) , the most prominent members of Task Force Purana . Alphonse Gangitano , the self-styled \" Black Prince of Lygon Street \" , kills a man at a party over a small debt and , with Jason 's assistance , injures 13 innocent people . During his trial , Gangitano is murdered by Jason , although the killing goes unsolved . The Moran brothers buy a pill press and employ Carl Williams to produce their drugs . Carl secretly begins making his own supply and forms an alliance with Moran rival Tony Mokbel ( Robert Mammone ) . When Carl is busted by the police , Jason discovers his double-cross and shoots him in the stomach , before Jason is arrested . Mark Moran takes over the drug business , selling Tony Mokbel out to a corrupt officer from the drug squad . Carl kills Mark with the assistance of drug dealer Dino Dibra ( Daniel Amalm ) and L ( Ian Bliss ) , who establish an alibi . Lewis Moran hires Andrew \" Benji \" Veniamin ( Damian Walshe-Howling ) to avenge his stepson , believing the killer to be Dibra . Benji kills Dibra then offers his services to Carl and becomes his bodyguard , although Carl is eventually jailed . Carl 's wife , Roberta ( Kat Stewart ) , is forced to run the business and she begins an affair with Benji . Carl is released from jail and Jason Moran is given special parole conditions to allow him to move to London . Moran rival Nik \" The Russian \" Radev ( Don Hany ) becomes a liability and Carl has him murdered by Benji and T. ( Alex Dimitriades ) . Jason returns from London and a concerned Lewis offers to run the business , but is arrested during a bust . With Benji under constant police observation , Carl asks L. and T. to murder Jason , who is executed in front of his children . Carl orders a hit on small-time dealer Willie Thompson , who turns out to be a friend of Tony Mokbel . However , Tony blames another small-time dealer , Michael Marshall , for the crime and asks Carl to kill him . Carl 's hitmen L. and T. shoot Marshall and are immediately arrested , but the police are unable to prove Carl 's involvement in the crime . When Graham Kinniburgh is murdered , Carl agrees to end the violence and asks Benji to murder Gatto . Gatto instead kills Benji and is arrested , although he is later acquitted . A new thug , Keith Faure ( Kym Gyngell ) ( only named in the 2011 \" Uncut \" broadcast ) , offers to team up with Carl , while his real motive is to take over for himself . Several days later , Faure kills Lewis Moran in a crowded bar . Consumed by revenge for Benji 's death , his friend , convicted killer Lewis Caine ( Marcus Graham ) , decides to kill Condello , the only surviving member of the Carlton Crew . However , Caine is double-crossed by his accomplices and is murdered beforehand . Detective Owen has Condello 's bodyguard \" Tibor \" arrested . They agree to have Tibor act as an undercover agent to record Condello ordering a hit on Carl . Meanwhile , Carl 's jailed associates testify against him . In the series final episode , Task Force Purana and Owen arrest Carl at a family barbecue . A voice-over , performed by police officer Jacqui James , reveals that Mick Gatto is eventually acquitted for the killing of Andrew Veniamin and that Mario Condello is killed while awaiting trial on attempted murder charges . The final voice-over was rerecorded during the production of Underbelly : Razor in preparation for the 2011 airing of the show in Victoria to also include information on Carl Williams ' murder , and Tony Mokbel 's arrest in a \" cheap wig \" in Greece . = = = Inaccuracies = = = While the series retells the real events of the gangland war , several inaccuracies have been pointed out and some deliberate fictionalizations have been made . The Purana Taskforce , as presented in this series , is not a portrayal of the real taskforce , as laws in Victoria do not allow real police officers , including those who previously served and were not sacked , to be portrayed by actors in the media . As a result , the characters presented are entirely fictional characters vaguely based on the real officers , leading to some major differences such as the series suggesting that a senior officer died due to a heart attack , which never in fact occurred . In the first episode when Steve Owen pulls over Susie Money , when she hands him her license , one can momentarily see the birth date on the back of the card ; it shows her birth year as 1984 . Being that it is 1995 at the time of this scene , that would make her 11 years old . In the second episode , during the outdoor scene after Alphonse 's funeral , a tram stop sign can be seen . This style and design of tram signage wasn 't introduced until well into the 2000s . When Carl Williams is shot in the series by Moran the shooting takes place at the Willamstown Botanical Gardens in Willamstown , in front of Willamstown Beach , however the real shooting occurred in Broadmeadows , where no shoreline can be seen . In the seventh episode , Paul Kallipolitis is murdered in his home by Andrew Veniamin , and in the following episode , Victor Peirce is murdered outside of his home . While both murders occurred in 2002 , the series timeline is incorrect , as Peirce was murdered on 1 May , and Kallipolitis was murdered on 15 October . The execution of Victor Peirce in episode eight is portrayed as taking place in his car at the front of his home , but Peirce was shot dead while parked opposite a supermarket in Bay Street , Port Melbourne . The murder of alleged drug dealer Willie Thompson was portrayed in episode ten as Thompson being shot after leaving a martial arts class in broad daylight . However , Thompson was shot dead at around 9 : 30 pm , and the murder occurred on Waverley Road in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone , as he began to drive off in his car , directly outside the entrance to the martial arts centre . Another fiction portrayed was the murder of Nik Radev by both Victor Brincat and Andrew Veniamin in the late hours of the night when Radev was in fact ambushed on a residential street in Coburg in the company of two bodyguards in the late afternoon . In all episodes showing the Melbourne skyline , the Eureka Tower is shown ; however , the building was not actually completed until 2006 , at least two years after the events depicted in the series . Radio Station 3AW is heard on the frequency of 693 kHz in 2004 ; it only change to this frequency in 2006 . = = Cast and characters = = Underbelly features four regular cast members , with 27 actors who recur throughout the series . Main Cast Rodger Corser as Detective Steve Owen Caroline Craig as Detective Jacqui James Gyton Grantley as Carl Williams Kat Stewart as Roberta Williams ( Carl 's wife ) The recurring cast includes : = = Production = = = = = Development = = = Underbelly is based on the book Leadbelly : Inside Australia 's Underworld , by Age journalists John Silvester and Andrew Rule . As the Nine Network was interested in creating local and world-class television , they decided to invest in a drama series that told the story of the Melbourne gangland killings . Jo Horsburgh , Nine Network Head of Drama , stated that the network was \" 100 percent committed to bringing Underbelly to the small screen \" . Des Monaghan , executive producer for Screentime , called the series \" one of the most exciting and challenging drama projects ever shot in [ Australia ] \" . The script took 12 months to write , beginning in June 2006 , with the main writers , Greg Haddrick , Peter Gawler and Felicity Packard putting together an entire episode themselves before their scripts were edited . Haddrick , Screentime 's Head of Drama , felt that the challenge for the writing team was to \" capture the essential truth of these extraordinary events in a compelling and coherent manner \" . Underbelly was filmed in Melbourne , at locations around the city where the real-life events occurred . Filming took over 82 days , from 2 July to 19 October 2007 , with 150 inner urban locations utilised and 450 locations surveyed making the series as close to life as possible . Parts of the series were filmed in the Essendon area , near many of the houses and schools associated with the \" Underworld \" . Many of the Carlton scenes were filmed in North Melbourne , primarily around Errol Street . All La Porcella filming was done at Rubicon Restaurant Errol Street , and jail visit sequences were filmed in the dressing rooms at the Telstra Dome . = = = Marketing = = = The Nine Network spent more than fifteen million dollars producing and promoting Underbelly . The lead-up resulted in a heavy marketing campaign which covered radio , print , billboards and an increased online presence , including the use of social networking tools . When the CEO of the Nine Network , David Gyngell noted the need to up its online presence , and embrace social networking as a valuable marketing tool , the official website was launched . The original website was launched on 15 January 2008 , with only a 3-minute trailer ; while the full site , with all its features , launched on 1 February 2008 . It was announced that the full first episode would be available for download on the site on 10 February , three days before the show premieres on television , but this option was made unavailable due to the Supreme court suppression case . This intention follows a similar strategy used for the launch of Sea Patrol in 2007 . The site was \" poised to become \" the biggest and most detailed website the Nine Network has hosted for a show so far , including features such as behind the scenes footage , profiles , visitor interactivity and the use of social networking tools . Due to the court injunction , the Nine Network was ordered to remove character profiles from its official website in Victoria . According to its marketing , Underbelly \" uses the framework of the murderous war between the two gangs , and the bigger moral war between the gangs and the Purana Task Force , to explore a complex array of individual stories and relationships \u2014 some touching , some incredible , all breathtaking \u2014 it is a mini-series that examines the kaleidoscopic nature of loyalty , love , revenge and pride when the normal and identifiable emotions of human attachment are moved from the context of social decency to social indecency . \" = = = Franchise = = = The series ' first prequel , Underbelly : A Tale of Two Cities , revolves around the organised crime groups that stemmed from the Griffith-based dope trade . The series follows the lives of two late infamous drug lords , \" Aussie Bob \" Trimbole and Terry \" Mr Asia \" Clark , portrayed by Roy Billing and Matthew Newton respectively . Filming took place in both Sydney and Melbourne until March 2009 . Sydney locations Richmond , Bondi Beach and Warwick Farm were used to portray Griffith in the 1970s . Writers Peter Gawler and Greg Haddrick admitted that there was more nudity and sex than the original . The prequel premiered on 9 February 2009 to 2.5 million viewers , making it the highest rated non-sporting program in the history of Australian television ratings . The second prequel , titled Underbelly : The Golden Mile , began airing on 11 April 2010 . A telemovie trilogy known as The Underbelly Files was made and then aired in early 2011 . The three telemovies Infiltration , The Man Who Got Away , and Tell Them Lucifer Was Here . The fourth series , Underbelly : Razor , began airing on 21 August 2011 and was mostly concerned with telling the story of 1920s criminal matriarchs Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh . It was also therefore a prequel to the original series . A New Zealand version titled Underbelly NZ : Land Of The Long Green Cloud aired in 2011 . The fifth series , Underbelly : Badness which tells the story of modern Sydney underworld figure Anthony Perish first aired on 13 August 2012 . The current production , Underbelly : Squizzy , is set to air in late 2013 and is a biography of Squizzy Taylor . = = Impact = = = = = Critical reception = = = The first episode of the series was screened privately to media on 17 January 2008 , prior the media had been treated with extracts and trailers promoting the series . On 3 January 2008 , The Sydney Morning Herald 's critic Michael Idato declared the series \" The Blue Murder of its time \" , referring to the critically acclaimed 1995 ABC TV drama Blue Murder , considered by many to be the finest crime drama ever produced in Australia . In a review on his blog on 17 January 2008 , David Knox , stated that Underbelly \" is our own Sopranos \" , and awarded it 4.5 out of 5 . He also commented \" If there are any criticisms to be found with Underbelly , they are few . One or two shots give away that period Melbourne was actually shot in 2007 . And while watching these gangsters thrive on power with ballsy disdain , it was hard not to think of the behaviour of some television executives in recent history . This aside , Underbelly looks set to be one of the highlights of the 2008 television year . \" A review appeared in the Herald Sun on 18 January 2008 , in which critic Paul Anderson quoted : \" Whether you followed the Melbourne gangland war or not , there 's a fair chance you will be blown away by the coming TV series Underbelly . [ It ] is a slick , violent and sexually charged dramatisation backed by a ripping soundtrack . \" In an article appearing on 31 January 2008 , The Daily Telegraph 's TV editor , Marcus Casey , said of Underbelly after viewing the first four episodes : \" If the quality is maintained then , while not perfect , Underbelly should equal , if not better , Australia 's best ever crime dramas \u2013 the Phoenix series and Blue Murder . \" = = = Australian Family Association 's reaction = = = On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association ( AFA ) , was publicly outraged that Underbelly would be screening at 8 : 30 pm , well within reach of children , after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet . The clips highlighted the use of extreme profanities , and scenes that show a violent bashing , a cold-blooded murder , and a sexual encounter . The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification , saying the clips , leaked from the Network 's production department , were indeed from the series , but not all of them made the final cut . The Network set its own classification , under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct . The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if the content of the show was anything near that of an unauthorised promotional clip leaked from Nine 's production department . = = = Ratings = = = The opening double episodes , which aired on 13 February , attracted an average of 1,320,000 viewers nationally , minus Victoria , making it the third most-watched show of the night . In Victoria alone , the series was expected to attract 800,000 to 1 million viewers , which would have put Underbelly figures over the 2 million mark . The replacement movie for Underbelly in Victoria , The Shawshank Redemption , managed only 271,000 viewers . The third episode , which aired on 20 February , managed to hold most of its viewers from its premiere , attracting 1,273,000 viewers nationally , a decline of only 50,000 viewers . The fourth episode , which aired on 27 February , managed to hold nearly all of its viewers from the previous episode , attracting 1,250,000 viewers nationally , a decline of only 23,000 viewers . Although leaked copies of all the episodes became available online , the show continued to attract \" huge television audiences \" . Underbelly averaged 1.26 million viewers for all 13 episodes . = = = Awards = = = Underbelly was nominated for eight awards at the 2008 AFI Awards , winning six . The awards won were : Best Drama Series ; Best Director ( Peter Andrikidis , for episode 7 ) ; Best Lead Actor ( Gyton Grantley ) ; Best Lead Actress ( Kat Stewart ) ; Best Guest or Supporting Actor ( Damian Walshe-Howling , for episode 7 ) ; and Best Guest or Supporting Actress ( Madeleine West , for episode 7 ) . The series was also nominated for Best Screenplay ( Peter Gawler ) ; and Best Guest or Supporting Actor ( Vince Colosimo , for episode 2 ) . At the 2008 Screen Music Awards , composer Burkhard Dallwitz won two awards for best television theme and best music for a television series . The show was also nominated for nine Logie Awards . It won three awards from the nominations of Most Outstanding Drama Series , Most Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series ( Gyton Grantley ) and Most Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series ( Kat Stewart ) . The other six nominations were from the categories of Most Outstanding Actor ( Vince Colosimo and Damian Walshe-Howling ) , Most Outstanding New Talent ( Lauren Clair ) , Most Popular Drama Series , Most Popular Actor ( Gyton Grantley ) and Most Popular Actress ( Kat Stewart ) . = = Legal issues = = = = = Supreme Court writ threat = = = George Defteros , a high-profile lawyer , against whom criminal charges were dropped because the prosecution did not have enough evidence , disrupted the lead-up to the series ' launch , when he threatened the Nine Network with a Supreme Court writ on 26 January 2008 . Defteros , said to be portrayed by George Kapiniaris , engaged a top Melbourne defamation specialist , saying : \" Any attempt to depict me as a lawyer of low impropriety and unethical behaviour will be met with legal proceedings instituted by my lawyers , I regard the depiction of the gangland wars , in particular my role as a lawyer acting for parties , as nothing more than farcical and pure pantomime . We 'll be watching it very closely . \" Nine Network had subsequently said there would now be no direct reference to Mr Defteros , despite earlier publicity . A spokeswoman for the network said \" There is no lawyer called Defteros in Underbelly \" , but Defteros said he could still be defamed by implication , noting \" it 's already been advertised as me \" . The case was dropped by Director of Public Prosecutions Paul Coghlan , QC , due to a lack of evidence . = = = Supreme Court suppression = = = The screening of Underbelly in Victoria was put into jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions , Jeremy Rapke , QC . Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series , after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria . A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice the jury in the trial of Evangelos Goussis , who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran . Although Goussis was not named in the series , there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial . The Supreme Court hearing took place on 11 February 2008 \u2013 only two days before the series was due to premiere . The Nine Network was ordered by a DPP subpoena to hand over tapes of all 13 episodes , as well as outlines and story lines , to the Victorian Supreme Court by 10 am on that date . The Nine Network refused to voluntarily hand over the tapes , saying they were incomplete and that the network 's lawyers were closely supervising production . However , it was willing to comply with any Court order and took the matter very seriously . The Network was also adamant that the series makes no assertions about the guilt of the accused killer . At the hearing , which took place at the Geelong Supreme Court , Justice Betty King gave prosecution and defence lawyers 24 hours to view the series and return to court the following day to decide whether it had the potential to affect the forthcoming trial . Justice King issued a suppression order on 12 February banning the Nine Network from broadcasting the series in the state of Victoria and on the internet until after the murder trial was completed . The Nine Network offered to air a heavily edited version in Victoria , but the offer was rejected by Justice King . It was initially planned that an alternative program , Underbelly : A Special Announcement , discussing the subject matter of the series , would air in Victoria instead of the series premiere . This idea was scrapped , and the movie The Shawshank Redemption was aired in Victoria instead . The Nine Network declared their intention to appeal the decision , and Network lawyers stated that they would exercise all legal options . The injunction also affected national audiences receiving transmissions from Imparja Television , a Nine Network affiliate , because its single national satellite distribution signal is retransmitted in some parts of Victoria . Alternative programming was to be shown until the restriction was lifted . The appeal began on 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal . Nine Network lawyers argued that the network should be allowed to broadcast the first three episodes of the series , arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the unedited version , rather than the final edited cut that was to be shown to audiences . The network believed the first three episodes , which depicted events from the beginning of the underworld war in 1995 , would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial . Goussis 's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008 . The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008 . Their decision on 26 March 2008 upheld Justice King 's ruling that the series was not to be broadcast or distributed in or out of Victoria . During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal , and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention to show any further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial . The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network 's application to appeal , and the network was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete . The ban expired the week ending 30 May 2008 , with the conviction of Goussis for the murder of Lewis Moran , paving the way for Nine to begin screening episodes ; however , Andrew Rule , who co-wrote the book on which the series is based , says Underbelly will not be seen in Victoria anytime soon , saying \" the problem now will be that Tony Mokbel is back in Australia and ready to stand trial on very serious charges . That will effectively prevent the series being screened in Victoria until that trial is held ... That could be some time . I 'm not sure about several [ years ] , but it might be two years . \" However , Underbelly was legally shown in Victoria in September 2008 , after a court ruled that the network could air the first five episodes . Supreme Court Justice Peter Vickery gave the network permission to air the specially edited episodes , but said screening the sixth episode could prejudice the upcoming trials of an accused criminal . The edited versions had whole scenes cut out , and Tony Mokbel 's face was pixelated . Reactions from viewers were not favourable , mainly because most had already seen the entire series . = = Underbelly : Uncut ( 2011 Victorian Broadcast Version ) = = The suppression order was partially lifted after Mokbel 's trial in April 2011 , after which the series was broadcast in Victoria . A 9 : 30pm timeslot allowed the airing of the ' Uncut ' edition , based on the episodes as they appeared in the DVD / Blu-ray release , and a few further alterations were made to update the show 's significantly outdated summary of current events . The final voice over of the series , in the episode \" Purana \" , was rerecorded ( during production of Underbelly : Razor ) to include events that occurred up to , and including , 2011 ( such as Carl Williams ' murder and Tony Mokbel 's arrest ) . It is almost a minute longer than the original voice over summary . Other episodes contained less significant changes to the original voice over summaries , indicating they had also been rerecorded . Kym Gynell ( Keith Faure ) , Alex Dimitriades ( Victor Brincat ) and Ian Bliss ( Thomas Hentschel ) are now fully credited in the episodes in which they starred , with the textual explanation given that their characters could not be named at the time of production but can now be named as of 2011 , due to the end of their related trials . They are still unnamed in the dialog of each episode . The show , however , is still not allowed to be sold on DVD / Blu-ray in Victoria , because a character in the \" Purana \" episode that was named in the original broadcast and DVD / Blu-ray release , was not allowed to be named at the time of the rebroadcast due to a pending court case and subsequently had their name edited out . Because the DVD / Blu-ray release is based on the original 2008 broadcast and not the 2011 \" Uncut \" broadcast , it is still not allowed to be sold in Victoria until the suppression order is fully lifted , or the alternative version is released . = = Sequel = = Fat Tony & Co. was confirmed on 3 August 2013 , with series production beginning on 5 August 2013 . It was not branded as Underbelly due to changes in funding with Screen Australia , but chronologically acts as a direct sequel to the first series of the show , with most of the same cast playing the same characters with only one or two exceptions . Based on Tony Mokbel , the series covers the manhunt for Mokbel that lasted 18 months , and dismantled his drug empire . It was filmed in Greece . It first aired on 23 February at 8.40pm on Channel 9 . = = Distribution = = = = = International distribution = = = Underbelly began airing in New Zealand on TV3 on Sunday at 9 : 30pm , but the network put the series on hiatus after three episodes because it was \" not performing as expected in the time slot \" . Due to a public outcry , TV3 reversed their decision 48 hours later , saying it was \" bowing to the pressure of angry fans \" . TV3 reinstated the series in its old timeslot , but rescheduled it to 11 : 15pm on Tuesday evenings just weeks later . TV3 senior publicist Nicole Wood said the show had failed to win new viewers in the Sunday slot , and even though they were \" inundated with fans \" when they took it off air , it \" still didn 't rate \" on its second showing . The series was brought back to primetime in July 2009 , after the sequel series performed well in New Zealand . Beginning with episode 1 , the series is currently playing every Thursday at 9 : 30pm . In April 2008 , the Nine Network signed an international distribution deal with Fox International Channels and Portman Film & Television . The series will be broadcast in Scandinavia , Canada , France , the UK , Italy ( Rai 4 ) , Balkans , Korea , Pan-Asia , Portugal , Russia , South Africa , Turkey and Germany . Gyngell said , \" to say we are pleased is an understatement \u2013 we are delighted that the series will gain international audiences and global recognition \" . Scottish commercial broadcaster STV have signed up to broadcast the series . Series 3 is now broadcasting after the good reception of the first two series . U.S. satellite-only service DirecTV will broadcast the entire trilogy , beginning in February 2010 , on its channel \" The 101 \" . Season 1 airs in the Republic of Ireland on free-to-air channel TV3 Ireland from Thursday , 23 September 2010 at 10pm . The series is also available on Netflix . = = = Illegal distribution = = = Despite the ban on broadcasting the series in Victoria , Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution . The first episode was made available on torrent sites within 20 minutes of it concluding in New South Wales . The Nine Network reportedly obtained the IP address of the first person to upload the show , and network lawyers were considering legal action . The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) was investigating the matter , and was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police . Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance screener versions of the first eight episodes were posted online . Every episode of the 13-part series was soon available for download on a range of sites . It was reported that on mininova.org more than 3,000 users were attempting to download episode seven late on the afternoon of 27 February 2008 . The Nine Network said it was considering legal action , and was looking into how copies got into the hands of underworld figures in Victoria , including Roberta Williams , the former wife of gangland kingpin Carl Williams . Unauthorised copies of the entire series were also made available to the public . People were offered a 4-disc DVD set for between A $ 10 and $ 80 in public places such as carparks and building sites . The episodes were commercial-free and came with introductory station countdowns , suggesting a major leak from inside the network 's production department . Two network employees had been questioned by the network over the matter , but both denied distributing any copies of the series . Unlicensed DVDs containing the first nine episodes of Underbelly were seized in a raid by police on a business in Melbourne 's western suburbs on 11 March 2008 . The 41-year-old man arrested faced charges of copyright infringement and of breaking the court order banning broadcast of the program in Victoria . Along with the Underbelly DVDs , more than 7000 other unlicensed DVDs were uncovered , as well as eight printers and 70 new DVD burners . The group of ingringers contained several members , some of whom had been arrested for offences in the months prior . = = = Merchandise = = = The legal Underbelly DVD was released 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment , a day after the final episode was aired on television . In accordance with the legal suppression , the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet . Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale , distribution or exhibition in Victoria . Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law , but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt . The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia . In September 2008 , a Limited Edition DVD was released , containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams \u2013 A Day of Reckoning . The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008 , both as a CD and online . It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series . Underbelly was released on Blu-ray on 5 August 2010 .",

Smithers , Jr . , usually referred to as Mr. Smithers or simply Smithers , is a recurring fictional character in the American animated sitcom The Simpsons , who is voiced by Harry Shearer . Smithers first appeared in the episode \" Homer 's Odyssey \" , although his voice could be heard in the series premiere \" Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire \" . He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant 's owner Mr. Burns . Smithers ' devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller . The idea for Smithers ' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon , who proposed that Smithers should be gay , but little attention should be drawn to it . Smithers ' first name ( Waylon ) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers . Smithers was originally animated and intended for storyline purposes by some producers and directors to be African American . This however was ultimately changed in later episodes with conflicting and unknown confirmed reasons as to why . Matt Groening however in an unintended interview with TMZ , confirms that the animation director at that time originally drew Smithers black according to plan , but he was changed to \" yellow \" . When asked by the interviewer why he wasn 't kept that way , Groening did not respond other than \" it was a mistake \" . Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns , and the relationship between the two is a frequent running gag on The Simpsons . In many ways , Smithers represents the stereotype of a closeted gay man , and numerous overt allusions and double entendres concerning his homosexuality are made , though some of the show 's producers instead interpret him as a \" Burns-sexual \" . In the season 27 ( 2016 ) episode \" The Burns Cage \" , he came out as gay . = = Role in The Simpsons = = Smithers is Mr. Burns ' devoted executive assistant . His father , Waylon Smithers , Sr. , worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown , when Smithers was a baby . Although he is not openly gay , Smithers frequents Springfield 's gay village and goes on a vacation to a male-only resort . It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once , but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them . Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns , and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as \" Burns-sexual \" . Mr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers ' devoted adoration , much to Smithers ' frustration . Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and in \" A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love \" , Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion . Burns , for his part , views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey , albeit a highly valued one for his competence . He has \" rewarded \" Smithers ' devotion with the future \" honor \" of being buried alive with him after he dies . Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns . In \" Homer the Smithers \" , Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement . When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face , Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired . Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns ' assistant and eventually gets his job back . In the season 27 episode \" The Burns Cage \" , Smithers admits his love to Burns , who reaffirms his contempt for his assistant . Smithers ' official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant , which he says is \" actually about 2,800 smaller jobs \" responsible for monitoring employee attendance , and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee of the month awards . He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president , but Burns has repeatedly quashed this dream , while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog . Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in Springfield and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club . = = Character = = = = = Creation = = = Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller . The idea for Smithers ' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon , who proposed that Smithers should be gay , but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads . Jay Kogen said \" Originally he was gay and black ... But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay . \" The script for \" Blood Feud \" originally featured Smithers saying \" Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids \" , but the line had to be cut for time . Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer , who is also the voice of Mr. Burns . Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take . Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers . The name Waylon was first used in \" I Married Marge \" and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers . Smithers made his first appearance in \" Homer 's Odyssey \" , which was the third episode of the first season , although he can be heard over a speaker in The Simpsons series premiere \" Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire \" . In his first visual appearance in \" Homer 's Odyssey \" , Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made darker than most characters by Gyorgi Peluci , the color stylist . David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be \" Mr Burns ' white sycophant \" , and the staff thought it \" would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character \" and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode . Silverman retconned this error by saying that Smithers had a tan from a recent holiday in the Caribbean . The first appearance of a yellow Smithers was \" There 's No Disgrace Like Home \" , the fourth episode of the first season . = = = Development = = = Smithers ' relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on The Simpsons . Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns . There have often been strong hints about Smithers ' true feelings for his boss , with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode \" The Telltale Head \" . Smithers ' sexual orientation has often come into question , with some fans claiming he is a \" Burns-sexual \" and only attracted to his boss , while others maintain that he is , without a doubt , gay . During the Bill Oakley / Josh Weinstein era , they still tried to keep his sexuality mysterious and there was debate among the writers about his orientation . Al Jean , who thinks of Smithers as being a \" Burns-sexual \" , felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman , then Smithers would not be gay . David Silverman , a former supervising director has said , \" [ Smithers ] seems to be focused on one particular human , as opposed to anything beyond that . [ Rather than being gay ] , he 's sort of ' Burns-sexual . ' \" In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian , but Smithers was not included . A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers ; Patty Bouvier , Marge Simpson 's lesbian sister , was included on both lists . The debate is referenced in \" The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular \" , when the episode host , Troy McClure is answering viewer questions , and one that is asked is \" What is the real deal with Mr. Burns ' assistant Smithers ? You know what I 'm talking about . \" A montage of various clips that shows Smithers ' lust for Mr. Burns follows , and in the end , McClure says \" as you can see , the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he 's Mr. Burns ' assistant . He 's in his early forties , is unmarried , and currently resides in Springfield . Thanks for writing ! \" Several of the allusions to Smithers ' sexuality have turned into battles with the censors . For example , in Smithers ' fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in \" Rosebud \" , the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked . Another example is \" Marge Gets a Job \" , which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window . The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy , but originally it went on for a few seconds longer . It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed \" Mr. Burns land [ ing ] in a particular position on Smithers ' anatomy \" . There were also issues with \" the lump in his bed \" , which the animators said had drawn as his knee , but the censors had misinterpreted . In the second season , the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns ' relationship , and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus , but many never came to fruition . Mostly in the early seasons , Smithers had a catchphrase , which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is . Smithers and Burns would watch Homer ( usually over a security camera feed ) and Burns would ask , \" Who is that man ? \" , to which Smithers would reply , \" That 's Homer Simpson , sir , one of your [ drones , organ banks , carbon blobs , etc . ] from sector 7G . \" Burns would invariably respond , \" Simpson , eh ? \" In September 2015 , it was confirmed by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a season 27 episode . The episode , \" The Burns Cage \" , was broadcast the following April and saw Smithers unsuccessfully try to move on from Burns . A writer for British progressive magazine the New Statesman felt that the episode was a retcon , making a serious story about the character 's homosexuality instead of the previous jokes and innuendo which were arguably homophobic . = = Reception = = In 2004 , The Simpsons producers announced that one of their characters was going to come out of the closet . Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada ( even claiming Smithers ' \" sexual orientation was about the worst-kept secret in Springfield \" ) as well as in Australia , New Zealand , Ireland , ( the Irish Independent called Smithers \" too obvious \" a choice ) , and the United Kingdom . Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer , the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay , with Smithers at a million to one . PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on \" cartoon gaydar \" who was gay on the Simpsons , with 97 % of the respondents choosing Smithers . Jenny Stewart , the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll , \" We 've never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on The Simpsons . \" It was Patty Bouvier who came out . In a 2007 article , Entertainment Weekly named Smithers the 16th-greatest sidekick of all time . They have also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being \" TV 's most functional dysfunctional couple \" . Star News Online named \" Smithers ' fey way \" as one of the four hundred reasons why they loved The Simpsons . In a 2003 article , Entertainment Weekly named the \" Who Shot Mr. Burns ? \" duo of episodes , in which Smithers was prominently featured , the series ' 25th-best episode . Gay.com ranked Smithers as the sixth-gayest cartoon character . = = Merchandise = = Smithers was made into an action figure , and four different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line . The first shows Smithers in his normal attire with a picture of Mr. Burns at his feet and was released in 2000 as part of \" wave two \" . The second , released in 2002 as part of \" wave ten \" , is called \" resort Smithers \" and shows him dressed as he was at the resort in the episode \" Homer the Smithers \" . In 2003 , a series of figures exclusive to Electronics Boutique was released , and a set of one Mr. Burns figure and two different Smithers toys based on the episode \" Rosebud \" were included . One , called \" Bobo Smithers \" shows Smithers dressed as Mr. Burns ' teddy bear Bobo ; and the other , known as \" future Smithers \" , shows him as a robotic dog . A \" future Burns \" was included in the set as a companion to \" future Smithers \" and depicts Burns as a robot as he appeared at the end of the episode .",

                    "text": "The End of All Things = \" The End of All Things \" is the fourteenth episode of the fourth season of the American science-fiction drama television series Fringe , and the series ' 79th episode overall . In the episode , the fringe team investigates Olivia 's ( Anna Torv ) disappearance , ultimately tracing back to David Robert Jones ( guest star Jared Harris ) . It was written by co-executive producer David Fury and directed by Jeff Hunt . The episode marked the beginning of a four-week break for the series , though the producers initially thought the gap would start with the following episode , \" A Short Story About Love \" . Executive producer Jeff Pinkner called it a \" game-changer \" that would \" peel back some layers \" surrounding the Observer 's background . \" The End of All Things \" first aired on February 24 , 2012 in the United States on the Fox network to an estimated 3.1 million viewers , an increase from the previous week . It received generally positive reviews from critics , with many praising Harris ' performance and the unveiling of more of the series ' mythology . In 2013 , following the conclusion of the final season , IGN ranked the episode the fourth best of the entire series . = = Plot = = Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) has been taken to a disused medical facility by David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ) and his agents . She is placed in the same room along with Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) , also secured to a chair , revealing she was also abducted by Jones the night before . Jones arrives and asserts that Olivia has great abilities due to her Cortexiphan doping but he must coax them out of Olivia . He presents a light box test that Olivia should be able to activate with her mind , torturing Nina to create the emotional driver , but Olivia admits she can 't do it without rest . During this period , Olivia , her memories a mix of her own and that of Olivia from Peter Bishop 's ( Joshua Jackson ) timeline , asks Nina to help her make an emotional connection , but she recognizes that this Nina is not the real one but instead the one from the parallel universe . Olivia continues to play along , explaining to Nina that her Cortexiphan abilities could only be induced by being near Peter ; Nina fakes illness to be extracted from the room , where she explains to a complicit Jones that they need to abduct Peter . Following Olivia 's disappearance , Peter discovers a surveillance camera in her apartment . He takes its memory device , which has been overwritten numerous times like a palimpsest , to Walter Bishop 's ( John Noble ) laboratory , using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc . Lincoln Lee ( Seth Gabel ) and Phillip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) take Nina into custody , learning that someone with Nina 's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan over the last few months ; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk . As they work , Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia 's state , even if unintentionally , imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her . They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey ( Monte Markham ) , a man with ties to Jones and Nina , and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes . Their work is disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September ( Michael Cerveris ) , bleeding from a chest wound . With September nearly dead , Peter decides to use Walter 's equipment to enter the Observer 's mind to try to learn of Olivia 's location . Within September 's consciousness , Peter learns the Observers are a team of scientists from one possible future of humanity , having used technology to travel to the past to witness their own creation . September , however , disrupted events by attempting to observe the point where Peter 's cure was discovered , and his disruption has since caused several unintended changes within the timeline , including the war between the two universes . Ultimately , this would lead to the birth of Henry , Peter 's child with the parallel universe 's Olivia , which September claimed never should have happened and will be a catalyst for disruption of future events . By Peter entering the Machine and altering the timeline , Henry also ceased to exist . September explains that Peter 's reappearance may be a means to set things right , and insists he find a way to reunite his romance with his original Olivia . As the reality of September 's mind breaks down and he claims \" they are coming \" , the Observer tells Peter to \" go home \" . Peter is suddenly woken up in the lab , September 's body goes into convulsions and vanishes . Peter realizes that September 's message was literal , and returns to his home , where he is knocked out by Jones ' men . He is brought to the same facility as Olivia and tied up . As they prepare to torture him , Olivia begins to use her powers to activate the lights , not only on the box but within the facility , creating electrical sparks that kill one of Jones ' men . As Jones and Nina retreat , Olivia frees Peter and they give chase , though Olivia suffers from a seizure , following excessive use of her powers . They catch up to Jones and Nina as they are crossing back to the parallel universe , but the two are able to escape . Peter contacts the authorities to bring medical help for Olivia . As they are waiting , Peter admits to Olivia that he fears what he has done to her memories , and has seen his original Olivia through the Observer 's mind . He leaves her , believing that staying away from this Olivia would be for the best . = = Production = = \" The End of All Things \" was written by co-executive producer David Fury , while being directed by CSI : Crime Scene Investigation veteran , Jeff Hunt . It was Hunt 's third series credit ( his other two being \" The Man from the Other Side \" and \" The Box \" ) . Leading up to the episode 's broadcast , executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked in a conference call with journalists that it was a \" game-changer \" because \" our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the \u00fcber-plot of the season \u2019 s bad guy , David Robert Jones . \" Referring to the Observer September , Pinker added that the episode would also peel \" back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we \u2019 ve seen before . \" Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated \" We always said you would find out about the Observers this season and we were going to investigate them a lot more . We \u2019 re excited about it all . That \u2019 s a highlight \u2013 the Observers are a highlight . For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go , ' Wow , I didn \u2019 t see that coming ! ' That \u2019 s why we get up in the morning is to take people along for the ride . We \u2019 re excited about what \u2019 s coming up , too . \" \" The End of All Things \" began a four-week break for the series , though the producers initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode . They were pleased that the switch did not cause issues , with Pinkner noting that \" we \u2019 re sort of in a zone of episodes where each one is amazing and each one either turns the story or resolves something important or there \u2019 s a cliffhanger \u2013 several episodes where each one is pretty awesome in itself and is also important to the overall patchwork of the season . We were very happy this ended up being one before we went on a little break . I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come back and watch the next one as well . \" The episode was the first time that the characters of Nina Sharp and David Robert Jones had common scenes within the show , but both Blair Brown and Jared Harris had previously acted together as mother and son in an off-Broadway production of the play Humble Boy . During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers , Brown actually injured herself on the rusty bedsprings used as the prop for the show . Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as \" Meana \" due to her seemingly \" mean \" personality , and speculated that Nina may have become this way because without William Bell , \" she wasn \u2019 t at the party with all of the boys , the science boys \" and thus developed an \" outsider \" perspective . She said of the role , \" It \u2019 s a really interesting thing to play . I love the fact that they look exactly the same , at least for a while . \" = = Reception = = = = = Ratings = = = \" The End of All Things \" first aired on February 24 , 2012 in the United States . The last episode before a four-week hiatus , it was watched by an estimated 3.1 million viewers , with a ratings share of 1.2 , an improvement from the previous episode , \" A Better Human Being \" . Fringe and its lead-in Kitchen Nightmares helped its network , Fox , tie for third place with NBC for the night . = = = Reviews = = = The episode has received generally positive reviews from television critics . Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times remarked , \" Great acting , a decent twist and the truth behind one of the most enigmatic characters in television history . Why can \u2019 t more Fringe episodes be like this ? Why can \u2019 t more television be like ' Fringe ? ' \" . Hanson also lauded Jared Harris ' performance , calling him \" a fantastic villain . Arrogant and superior , with hints of insecurity . Jones \u2019 speech about all living creatures needing incentive might have been goofy coming from any other actor , but from Harris , it is creepy beyond belief . So glad Fringe found a way to bring David Robert Jones back . \" IGN 's Ramsey Isler rated it 9.0 / 10 for being a \" fast-paced story \" that was \" the best episode of the season so far \" . He continued \" Olivia 's great escape from Jones and Bad Nina was fantastic television and some clever writing . \" Isler did find some of the Observer revelations \" a bit of a let-down \" however , as he felt he had already been made aware of them ; this was not enough to make him critical of the episode . Writing for The A.V. Club , columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with an A- , and praised September 's stumbling entrance into the lab as \" yet another rich and remarkable scene \" . Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen had a more negative opinion , and commented that the episode \" failed to make my dinger hum , \" which he attributed to high expectations set by fellow staff writer and former Fringe reviewer Ken Tucker . Jensen continued , \" It was , to my eyes , ' just okay . ' Certainly not the equal of the past two episodes . And not the strongest possible kicker to a strong second act for Fringe 's fourth season , which now takes a four-week snooze before rising anew on March 23 for the first of eight consecutive episodes \u2013 a sweep of story that might represent the very end of all things Fringe . Damn , I \u2019 m such a downer this week , aren \u2019 t I ? Ah , but so was this episode . \" In January 2013 , IGN ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the series , explaining that \" when Season 4 needed a boost of excitement , this episode delivered it in a timely fashion . It had a thrilling pace and offered answers to some questions that have lingering since the series began . \"",

                    "text": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = The Australian cricket team in England in 1948 was captained by Don Bradman , who was making his fourth and final tour of England . The team is famous for being the first Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing a match . This feat earned them the nickname of The Invincibles , and they are regarded as one of the greatest cricket teams of all time . According to the Australian federal government the team \" is one of Australia 's most cherished sporting legends \" . Including five Test matches , Australia played a total of 31 first-class fixtures , plus three other games , two of the non-first-class matches being played in Scotland . They had a busy schedule , with 112 days of play scheduled in 144 days , meaning that they often played every day of the week except Sunday . Their record in the first-class games was 23 won and 8 drawn ; in all matches , they won 25 and drew 9 ; many of the victories were by large margins . They won the Test series 4 \u2013 0 with one draw . The strength of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line-up , which included Bradman , Arthur Morris , vice-captain Lindsay Hassett , Neil Harvey and Sid Barnes , and the hostile fast bowling of Ray Lindwall , Keith Miller and Bill Johnston . Due to the popularity of Bradman , generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time , and the fact that he had announced that it was his farewell international tour , the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country , and many records for match attendances were broken . The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times , in the Second , Third and Fourth Tests , and stands to this day . = = Touring party = = = = Significance = = The 1948 Australian team has great significance in cricket history as it is the only side to tour England unbeaten , earning the sobriquet The Invincibles . The tour was captain Donald Bradman 's last Test series , and the immediate postwar team was the most successful that Bradman appeared in . It has been claimed that English cricket suffered more heavily from the effects of World War II than the Australians . Even so , various commentators have rated the 1948 Australians as one of the best cricket teams ever , and it is often compared to other great outfits such as the 1902 Australian touring team , Warwick Armstrong 's Australian side of just after World War I , the West Indies team of the 1980s and the Australian team of the 1990s and 2000s . This was not a view shared by Jack Fingleton , Bradman 's batting rival from the 1930s , who wrote ' the 1948 Australian side to England , side that some critics , ignoring the apparent lack of strength in English cricket that season , dubbed the \" best Australian team ever \" \u2013 which was just moonshine . Yorkshire almost beat the Australians of 1948 ' , but his view is very much in the minority . The high regard with which The Invincibles are held in the annals of Australian and world cricket is reflected in the various honours accorded to the players . Bradman , Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 . Hassett , Morris and Harvey were later inducted , so that 20 % of the inductees are from the 1948 team . Of these six , all except Hassett were selected in Australia 's Team of the Century , with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy . Bradman , Lindwall , Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council 's Hall of Fame . In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians . Graveney strongly disagreed with the result , writing ' there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman 's Australian tourists of 1948 ' . The computer regarded Sam Loxton as a member of the team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey , if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team . = = Preparations = = Since the resumption of cricket following World War II , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and their captain Donald Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . The committee that selected the touring party was Bradman , Jack Ryder and Chappie Dwyer . They held their final meeting on Wednesday 11 February and announced the team that day . The team was chosen with a dual emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling . This was in large part because England had agreed to make a new ball available after 55 six-ball overs in the Tests ; a new ball was generally taken after every 200 runs , which usually takes more than 55 overs to accumulate , the rule change meant that a new ball was more frequently available . A new ball is more helpful to fast bowling , so this move favoured the team with the better pace attack , in this case Australia . Australia had injury concerns to key players ahead of the tour . Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack , and he only made the trip after a 3 \u2013 2 vote by a medical panel , despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit . Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon . In addition , his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action . The injury was worked on ahead of the tour , while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action . The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled , and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied . Bradman 's counsel was effective , as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour . Bill Jeanes , who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the previous Australian tour of England in 1938 , was offered the job of managing the 1948 team , but turned it down . Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that cricket historian Gideon Haigh has called \" increasingly officious and liverish \" . He was replaced by Keith Johnson , the New South Wales delegate to the Australian Board of Control . Johnson had previously managed the Australian Services team \u2014 which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett \u2014 in the Victory Tests that took place in 1945 at the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe . = = = Warm-up matches in Australia = = = Before they sailed for England , Australia played three warm-up matches . The first two were two-day games against Tasmania in Hobart and at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground , Launceston ; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth . In Hobart , Australia scored 538 / 5 declared with centuries by Barnes , Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122 . Using a mixture of pace and spin , they reduced Tasmania to 186 / 7 when time ran out . In Launceston , Australia won by an innings and 49 runs . Toshack took 5 / 24 as Tasmania fell for 123 . Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116 , Barnes taking 3 / 1 . Four days later , on Saturday 13 March , the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia . Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112 , while five bowlers took two wickets each . Australia replied with 442 / 7 declared , including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman . Western Australia only had time to reach 62 / 3 and the game was drawn . The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500 . = = Voyage and stopover in Ceylon = = The team set sail on board RMS Strathaird from Fremantle on Friday 19 March . En route to England , the Australians berthed in Colombo where they played a one-day single-innings match \u2014 not limited overs \u2014 against the Ceylon national team at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground . The local newspaper The Islander ran a headline of \" Bradman Will Definitely Play \" and this guaranteed a crowd of more than 20,000 . Australia batted first and became suspicious about the pitch as the morning went on . At lunch , Ian Johnson demanded that the pitch be measured and it was found to be only 20 yards ( 18 m ) long . After that , the bowlers delivered from two yards behind the crease . Australia made 184 / 8 declared ( Barnes 49 , Miller 46 ) before a monsoon ended the match with Ceylon at 46 / 2 in reply . The party docked at Tilbury on Friday 16 April to a resounding welcome . Bradman announced the delivery of 17,000 food parcels as a gift to the British people from the State of Victoria . Great Britain was still in the throes of rationing and post-war austerity . = = Popularity = = Despite Australia 's ruthless on-field dominance and a succession of one-sided victories , the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest . Bradman 's dominant cricketing stature was a key factor in his team 's popularity with the public , especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign . A leading cricket writer of the time , R. C. Robertson-Glasgow , said \" we want him to do well . We feel we have a share in him . He is more than Australian . He is a world batsman . \" The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that \" cities , towns and hotels are beflagged , carpets set down , and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome . He is the Prince of Cricketers . \" Writing later , Haigh opined that \" perhaps no touring cricketer ... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer \" . Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day , and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live , causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin . Of Bradman 's retirement , Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack : \" ... a miracle has been removed from among us ... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal . \" As a team , the Australians were greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country , even when wet weather curtailed the matches . The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times , in the Second Test at Lord 's , the Third Test at Old Trafford , and the Fourth Test at Headingley . The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil . Off the field , the Australians were inundated with requests for social functions , including appointments with government officials and members of the royal family , and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements , with 112 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days . Three-day matches were often held consecutively with only the traditional Sunday rest day , although their dominance ended several matches prematurely and earned them extra rest days . Team manager Keith Johnson , the only administrator in the touring party , was flooded with phone calls and letters . Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson 's tireless work would cause health problems and that \" it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through \" . Wisden said \" Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager , Mr Keith Johnson , hard-working and always genial ... Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players , Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour . \" Bradman said that \" no side could have wished for a better manager \" . = = Bradman 's role = = Bradman 's position as a selector gave him more power than previous Australian captains , who did not have an explicit vote in team selection . This was further magnified by Bradman being a member of the Board of Control while still an active player , a threefold combination that he alone has occupied in Australian cricket history . According to Haigh , he \" was the dominant figure in Australian cricket \" , and an \" unimpeachable figure \" . At the age of 40 , Bradman was by four years the oldest player on the team ; three quarters of his team were 32 or younger , and some viewed him as a father figure . Bradman wrote that this was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days , as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed . He wrote : Knowing the personnel , I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for . A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned , who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice , follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs ... there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do . The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment . However , some players expressed displeasure at Bradman 's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition . Miller deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball for a duck in a protest against Australia 's world record of 721 runs in one day against Essex . He also deplored Bradman 's hard-nosed attitude in fixtures nominally designated as \" festival matches \" . Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability , Miller played with reckless aggression , rather than a measured style in line with his captain 's aim of remaining undefeated . Bradman 's letters in later life , published posthumously , revealed his hostility towards Miller . Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence \u2014 one of the reserve batsmen \u2014 to partake in meaningful matchplay due to captain 's reluctance to risk Australia 's unbeaten run . = = Roles and strategy = = As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , sometimes amounting to six days of cricket a week \u2014 Sunday was always a rest day \u2014 Australia employed a rotation policy in order to allow the players to recuperate , except for the Tests and matches against Worcestershire , the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Leveson-Gower 's XI , when they chose their strongest team . As a result , no member of the squad \u2014 Bradman included \u2014 played in more than 23 of the first-class matches . Thus , the vice-captain Hassett led the Australians in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested , and maintained the unbeaten run in all of them . Wisden opined that \" in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders \" . Likewise , the batting was regularly rotated . The three openers Barnes , Morris and Brown took turns sitting out , while the middle-order was changed frequently and the wicket-keeping duties divided between Tallon and Saggers . Australia 's bowling attack was led by Lindwall and Miller , who took the new ball in the Tests . Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball . English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs ; at the time , the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored , something that usually took longer than 55 overs . The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians , as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack . Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs . As a result , Australia 's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs , and the left arm seamer Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign . The new ball rule also meant that spin bowling was less effective in the Tests , so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests , off spinner Johnson , until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring . Together they took only eight wickets . Things were different in the county matches . As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests , he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches , and the three spinners Ring , Johnson and McCool did more of the work , especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests . Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests , despite not being in Bradman 's first-choice team . Bradman even used Hamence , a reserve batsman , to open the bowling at times , in order to rest his bowlers , and in the second match against Yorkshire , decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win , so that his bowlers could recuperate . = = Ashes Test matches = = The five-Test Ashes series was won convincingly by Australia 4 \u2013 0 . England was captained by Norman Yardley and their batting was strong on paper , the first four in the order generally being Len Hutton , Cyril Washbrook , Bill Edrich and Denis Compton . They were supported by the likes of Joe Hardstaff junior , Tom Dollery , Charlie Barnett , Jack Crapp , John Dewes , Allan Watkins , Yardley and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans . However , they found the fast bowling trio of Lindwall , Miller and Johnston \u2014 supported by the medium pace of Toshack \u2014 a real handful , especially with the 55-over new ball rule . Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers , with high pace and the ability to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen . Prior to World War II , pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body . England were yet to develop similar bowlers , and as a result , Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation . At one stage , the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton , something that provoked great controversy . Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece , at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively , while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15 . For England , the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton , who scored 562 runs at 62.44 . Washbrook ( 356 runs at 50.85 ) was the only other player to average beyond 45 . In contrast , Australia 's batsmen had relatively little difficulty against the hosts ' attack . England 's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser and against a powerful Australian batting line-up he managed only 18 wickets at 38.22 . Alec Coxon , Dick Pollard , Edrich , Barnett and Yardley provided his seam support . Jim Laker , Jack Young , Eric Hollies and Doug Wright were the spinners in action . Bedser was the only English bowler to take more than nine wickets . Morris led the runscoring and century-making with 696 runs at 87.00 and three triple-figure scores , supported by Bradman ( 508 at 72.57 ) and Barnes ( 329 at 82.25 ) . With the first three batsmen in such form , Australia regularly made strong starts to their innings , averaging more than 120 for their first two wickets . The resounding Australian victories gave the England selectors many problems as they sought to find a combination that could challenge the tourists ' superiority . As a result , England used 21 players in all , while Australia only used 15 , one of which was forced by injury . Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests , while England only had seven such players . = = = First Test = = = Since the Second World War , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . Prior to the First Test , Australia had played 12 first-class matches , winning ten and drawing two . Eight of the victories were by an innings , and another was by eight wickets . It was thought that Bradman would play Ring , but he changed his mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast . Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The first innings set the pattern of the series as the England top-order struggled against Australia 's pace attack . Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather , but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton . During the interval , heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption . Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall . At 15 / 2 , Compton came in , and together with Edrich , they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter . Two balls later , Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring , leaving England at 46 / 4 . Two runs later , Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board . Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again . Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74 , England only had two wickets left . Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes . Both fell within two runs , ending England 's innings at 165 . Laker top-scored with 63 . Johnston ended with 5 / 36 , a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing . Miller took 3 / 38 and a catch . Australia 's openers Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes . Ideal batting conditions greeted the players on the second day . Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris . Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62 . Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker . Australia scored slowly , as Yardley employed leg theory to slow the scoring . Brown came in at No. 5 , but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24 . Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293 / 4 , a lead of 128 . Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes , with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes . It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs . On the third morning , Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg . Johnson and Tallon came and went , failing to pass 21 . The scoring was slow during this passage of play \u2014 Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs . Lindwall came out to bat at 365 / 7 and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket . Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting . Both fell in quick succession , but Australia 's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509 , leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead . Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners , with Young ( 1 / 79 ) and Laker ( 4 / 138 ) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively . Bedser bowled 44.2 overs , taking 3 / 113 . At the start of England 's second innings , Washbrook and Edrich fell early , leaving England at 39 / 2 . This brought together England 's leading batsmen , Hutton and Compton , who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day . Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon , delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day . One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd . The English had the better of the late afternoon period , scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes . Hutton resumed on 63 and he and Compton progressed before the light deteriorated and a thunderstorm stopped proceedings . Shortly after the resumption , Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions , ending a 111-run partnership at 150 / 3 . The innings was then repeatedly interrupted by poor light . Wisden opined that \" rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day \" . Hardstaff supported Compton in a partnership of 93 before being removed by Toshack , and Barnett followed soon after at 264 / 5 . Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge , aided by a 57-run partnership with his captain before Johnston dismissed Yardley for 22 . England reached stumps at 345 / 6 , just one run ahead , with Compton on 154 . Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning , which was briefly interrupted twice by rain . After the resumption , Compton was out hit wicket for 184 after attempting to hook Miller . He had batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours . Wisden opined that \" No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side 's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances \" . Compton 's fall at 405 / 7 exposed the bowlers and Australia quickly finished off the innings within half an hour . England finished at 441 , leaving Australia a target of 98 . Lindwall 's absence meant that the remaining four frontline bowlers had to bowl more than 32 overs each \u2014 Johnston bowled 59 and ended with 4 / 147 while Miller took 4 / 125 from 44 overs . Australia progressed steadily to 38 before Bedser bowled Morris for nine and then dismissed Bradman for a duck , again caught by Hutton at short fine leg . This left Australia 48 / 2 . Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss . Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries . = = = Second Test = = = Australia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge . On the other hand , England made three changes ; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox of Young , all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5.batsman . Following his injury in the previous Test , Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman , who gambled on his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat . Miller played , but was unfit to bowl . Barnes fell for a duck , and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings , slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser . In the meantime , Morris , after a slow start , made 105 runs out of a total of 166 scored while he was at the wicket , including 14 fours and one six . His innings was noted for powerful , well-placed cover drives . His dismissal left Australia at 166 / 3 , quickly followed by Miller , left Australia at 173 / 4 . Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly , taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run . Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225 / 6 . Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258 / 7 . Australia 's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning . Tallon batted on , supported by Johnston and Toshack , who scored their highest Test scores . Australia 's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston \u2014 who scored 29 . Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston fell . Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers , ending with 4 / 100 from 43 overs , while debutant Coxon took 2 / 90 from 35 overs . Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball . He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over . Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32 / 2 . Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later . England were 46 / 4 and Australia were firmly in control . Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings , scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes . After the tea break , Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball . Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53 . One run later , Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134 / 6 with their skipper dismissed for 44 . Johnson then removed Evans for nine , before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket . After 85 minutes of resistance , Johnston removed both . England 's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9 / 207 . On the third morning , Lindwall removed Bedser , ending England 's innings at 215 , giving Australia a 135 first innings lead . Lindwall ended with 5 / 70 . The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings . Barnes was given an early life and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122 before Morris was bowled for 62 . Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket . Barnes accelerated after reaching his half-century . Once he reached his century , Barnes became particularly aggressive . He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs , including two successive sixes before finally falling for 141 , caught on the boundary from Yardley . He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings . The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296 / 2 after 277 minutes when he departed . Hassett was bowled first ball , so Miller came to the crease at 296 / 3 to face Yardley 's hat-trick ball . Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball . Bradman fell to Bedser again , this time for 89 . Brown joined Miller at 329 / 4 and Australia reached stumps at 343 , without further loss . After the rest day , the fourth morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages . In 88 minutes of play , Australia added a further 117 runs . Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run partnership with Miller , who was out for 74 , followed by Lindwall for 25 . Bradman declared with Australia at 460 / 7 , 595 runs ahead . Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers , with two each . Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch , and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball , troubling the English batsmen . Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times . Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42 , before Hutton edged Lindwall and was out for 13 . Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65 / 3 . However , Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106 / 3 . The final day started poorly for England , with Compton being caught off Johnston from the second ball of the day . Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over . Eight runs later , Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall bouncer that stayed low . Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141 / 8 . England were bowled out for 186 , ceding a 409-run victory . Toshack ended the innings with 5 / 40 , while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively . The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were \u00a3 43,000 \u2014 a record for a Test in England . = = = Third Test = = = When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short-pitched bowling . The omission generated considerable controversy. and the Australians were pleased , feeling that Hutton was England 's best batsman . Hutton 's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett . England made three further changes . Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department . Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp . Australia dropped Brown , who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings , for the all rounder Loxton . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The change in England 's opening pair did not result in better results . A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball , and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that helped the bowlers . Both fell early , leaving England 28 / 2 . Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves . Compton attempted to hook a Lindwall bouncer , but edged it into his face . This forced him to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33 / 2 . Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting , resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added . They reached lunch at 57 / 2 . Upon the resumption , Crapp accelerated , hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson . Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37 . Dollery then fell for one . England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97 / 4 . After 170 minutes of slow batting , Edrich fell to Lindwall . At 119 / 5 , Compton returned to the field , his wound having been stitched . Yardley fell for 22 with the score at 141 / 6 , bringing Evans to the crease . Compton and Evans added 75 runs , before Lindwall removed the latter to leave England at 216 / 7 . England resumed on the second day at 231 / 7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball . Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes , adding 37 and featuring in a 121-run partnership with Compton . Soon after , Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes , who was standing at short leg , forcing him into hospital . The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363 . Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting , having struck 16 fours . Lindwall took 4 / 99 and Johnston 3 / 67 . Barnes 's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener . Johnson was deployed as Australia 's makeshift second opener , but made only one , and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13 / 2 . Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings , adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell . Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126 / 3 at stumps . Australia had added only nine runs on the third morning when Miller fell for 31 . Four runs later , Morris fell for 51 , leaving Australia 139 / 5 . Barnes came in , despite having collapsed in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow to his chest . He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital . Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell . Lindwall came into bat at 172 / 6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on . Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled , leaving Australia 208 / 7 , five runs behind the follow-on mark . Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221 , giving England a lead of 142 runs . During his innings , Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich . One of the short-pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand , evoking cheers from the crowd . Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers , taking 4 / 81 and 3 / 53 respectively . Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at the start of the second innings , bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease . Lindwall did not bounce Edrich , but Miller did , earning the ire of the crowd . Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes . This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook . Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six , but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit . Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball , as England reached 174 / 3 at the close , with Washbrook unbeaten on 85 . The rest day was followed by the fourth day , which was abandoned due to persistent rain . Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day , leaving Australia a victory target of 317 , but the rain meant that the entire first session was lost . The tourists batted in a defensive manner to ensure a draw . They ended at 92 / 1 in 61 overs . Morris finished unbeaten on 54 , his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series . The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test . = = = Fourth Test = = = Australia made two changes for the Test . Harvey replaced the injured Barnes , while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps . England made three changes . Emmett was dropped and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position . Laker replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young . Dollery , who had made only 38 in three innings , was replaced by all-rounder Cranston . England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch . Hutton and Washbrook put on an opening partnership of 168 , the best by England in the series . Washbrook refrained from the hook shot , which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series . The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall . Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich , the pair batted until late in the first day , when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day . His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs . Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268 / 2 , with Edrich on 41 . The next day , Bedser batted on in steady support of Edrich . The pair saw England to lunch without further loss , and 155 runs were added for the third wicket before Bedser was out after almost three hours of batting for 79 . Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes . Edrich fell three runs later at 426 / 4 for 111 . With two new batsmen at the crease , Australia quickly made further inroads to leave England at 473 / 6 . Loxton then successively removed Cranston , Evans and Laker as England fell from 486 / 6 to 496 / 9 , before Miller bowled Yardley to end England 's innings at 496 . The home team had lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs . Loxton took 3 / 55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two . Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury . With Barnes injured , Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris . Morris fell for six , before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63 / 1 . Bradman did the majority of the scoring , finishing unbeaten on 31 . On the third morning , England made the ideal start when Pollard removed Hassett for 13 and Bradman for 33 in the same over . This left Australia struggling at 68 / 3 . Harvey , playing his first Ashes Test , joined Miller at the crease . Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner \" Let 's get stuck into ' em \" . If England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a substantial lead . The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead with many lofted boundaries . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker . Miller was dismissed by Yardley for 58 while attempting another six , but the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , prompting Wisden to liken it to a \" hurricane \" . Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The high rate of scoring during the innings freed the match from England 's firm control . Loxton was particularly severe on Laker , lifting his deliveries into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours . At the other end , Harvey and Johnson fell to Laker in quick succession to leave the score at 329 / 6 . Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson , and 15 runs later , Yardley bowled Loxton for 93 , while Saggers only managed five , leaving Australia at 355 / 8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He was the last man out at 458 , leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3 / 92 . Laker took 3 / 113 , while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each . England set about extending their first innings lead for the remainder of the fourth day . For the second time in the match , Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership . Washbrook made 65 and Hutton 57 , leaving England at 129 / 2 . Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off , adding 103 before Lindwall trapped Edrich lbw for 54 . England lost wickets at regular intervals late in the day to be 278 / 6 . When Johnston removed Compton for 66 , England were 7 / 293 with no recognised batsmen remaining , having lost 4 / 33 . Wicket-keeper Evans led a rearguard action as England reached 362 / 8 at the close of the fourth day . England batted on for five minutes on the final morning , adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365 / 8 , with Evans on 47 not out . Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures , with 4 / 95 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin . This left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce . Only 44 runs came in the first hour . Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton 's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57 . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack ; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton 's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121 / 1 . In the half hour preceding the interval , Australia had added 64 runs . Both had given chances , but England fumbled them . Upon resumption , Morris severely attacked Compton , who had been bowling in an attempt to exploit the spin , aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs . This prompted Yardley to take the new ball . Australia reached 202 , halfway to the required total , with 165 minutes left . Morris passed his century , and was then dropped on 126 . Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity . Australia reached tea at 288 / 1 with Morris on 150 . The pair had added 167 during the session . Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182 , having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes . He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting . This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required . He fell with eight runs still needed . Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs . Australia had won by seven wickets , setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase , with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours . The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds . The attendance remains a record for a Test in England . = = = Fifth Test = = = With the series already lost , England made four changes to their team . Dewes replaced the injured Washbrook , while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder . Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut . England played two spinners ; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker , while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard 's pace . The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes . Australia made three changes . Off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring . Australia 's second change was forced on them ; the injured seamer Toshack was replaced by the recovered batsman Barnes . The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury . The match saw Lindwall at his best . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch . Precipitation during the week meant that the start of the Test was delayed until the afternoon . The humid conditions , along with the rain , assisted the bowlers , with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights . Miller bowled Dewes for one with his second ball to leave England at 2 / 1 , before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10 / 2 . Lindwall dismissed Compton after Morris had taken a diving catch , and Miller then removed Crapp , who failed to score in his 23-ball innings , leaving England at 23 / 4 . After the lunch break , England had struggled to 35 / 4 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . The debutant Watkins then batted for 16 balls without scoring before Johnston dismissed him for a duck to leave England at 42 / 6 . Watkins also collected a bruise on the shoulder that inhibited his bowling later in the match . Lindwall then removed Evans , Bedser and Young , all yorked in the space of two runs . The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket-keeper Tallon , who grasped the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left . In his post-lunch spell , Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs , taking five wickets for eight runs , finishing with 6 / 20 in 16.1 overs . Bradman described the spell as \" the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket \" . Hutton was the only batsman to resist , scoring 30 in 124 minutes from 147 deliveries . No other player passed seven . Miller and Johnston took 2 / 5 and 2 / 20 respectively , and Ring was not needed to bowl . In contrast , Australia batted with apparent ease , and Morris and Barnes passed England 's first innings total by themselves . The score had reached 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61 , ending a partnership that had taken only 126 minutes . This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day . As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level , the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once . The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat . Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers . With 6996 Test career runs , he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket , but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly . Hassett came in at 117 / 2 and Australia closed at 153 / 2 . Morris was unbeaten on 77 . On the second morning , Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett 's fall for 37 . The following four batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20 . Morris was finally removed for 196 , ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving ; it took a run out to remove Morris . Australia were eventually out for 389 . Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies , who took 5 / 131 . England had relied heavily on spin ; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners . England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears . Lindwall made the early breakthrough , and Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the innings to close at the end of the second day on 54 / 1 . Early on the third day , Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 , before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes . On 39 , Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall . Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64 , having top-scored in both innings , to leave England at 153 / 4 . Thereafter , England collapsed in the fading light , . prompting the umpires to call off play . The ground was then hit by rain , resulting in a premature end to the day 's play . England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178 / 7 . England resumed on the fourth morning and Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs . Johnston ended with 4 / 40 and Lindwall 3 / 50 . This result sealed the series 4 \u2013 0 in favour of Australia . The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches . = = Other matches in Great Britain = = = = = v Worcestershire = = = At Worcester , 28 , 29 , 30 April . Worcestershire ( 233 and 212 ) lost to the Australians ( 462 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 17 runs . The pitch was slow , and the weather was cold and showery for the traditional tour opener against Worcestershire . Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than \u20a4 4000 . The hosts elected to bat , and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137 / 1 after 133 minutes . However , the dismissal of Charles Palmer , who top-scored with 85 , precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233 . Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets , with Johnson taking 3 / 52 . In their sole innings , Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris ( 138 ) and Bradman ( 107 ) . This took them to 265 / 1 , before they declared at 462 / 8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time . Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6 / 135 for the locals . In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs , with 70 minutes to spare . McCool took 4 / 29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets . = = = v Leicestershire = = = At Leicester , 1 , 3 , 4 May . The Australians ( 448 ) defeated Leicestershire ( 130 and 147 ) by an innings and 171 runs . Australia elected to bat , and Miller , who had been promoted to No. 3 , shared century partnerships with Barnes ( 78 ) and Bradman ( 81 ) . A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack , but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century . He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448 . The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler , taking 5 / 91 . Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings ; another Australian expatriate , Jack Walsh , top-scored with 33 . Ring took 5 / 34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs . Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced the prospect of being bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5 / 83 . After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day ; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat . Johnson ended with 7 / 42 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Bradford , 5 , 6 May . Yorkshire ( 71 and 89 ) lost to the Australians ( 101 and 63 / 6 ) by four wickets . This low-scoring game was the closest that Australia came to defeat on the tour . The game was played in cold , blustery , overcast and wet conditions that suited spin bowlers . Yorkshire made only 71 in their first innings . Miller mixed medium-paced off-breaks with his fast bowling and this combination returned him 6 / 42 . At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4 / 22 from 26 overs . Together the pair bowled almost unchanged , delivering 49.3 of 54.3 overs . Australia struggled in reply and stumps were called when they fell to 4 / 38 . Miller came in at the start of the second day 's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added , before falling at 7 / 86 , part of a collapse of 5 / 27 . He hit two sixes in his innings , including one from the first ball that he faced , feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions . Australia ended at 101 , and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury . Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire , 6 / 51 . Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings , which followed a similar pattern to their first effort . Wickets fell steadily as Johnston ( 6 / 18 ) and Miller ( 3 / 49 ) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs . Australia were set a target of 60 runs for victory , and Hassett elected to not have the pitch rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett \" might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch \" . Hassett and Hamence both fell with the score on 20 to leave Australia five down . Australia slumped to 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Loxton incapacitated by injury , but scraped home without further loss with Harvey and Tallon at the crease . Harvey was given two chances , once when he was on one , and Tallon was also missed . It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912 , but Harvey won the game with a straight drive over the fence . Wickets had fallen at less than 10 runs apiece , and at the rate of every four overs . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 8 , 10 , 11 May . The Australians ( 632 ) defeated Surrey ( 141 and 195 ) by an innings and 296 runs . Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for the opening stand before the latter fell for 65 . Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket . Barnes ' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes . After Bradman departed at 403 / 3 , wickets began to fall more regularly , but Hassett held up his end and made 110 , while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50 . Surrey 's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4 / 104 . On the second afternoon , Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings . Johnson took 5 / 53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out , but received little support , the next highest scores being 15 and 10 . Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day . They made continual inroads on the final day , and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win . Johnston took 4 / 40 and Johnson 3 / 40 . = = = v Cambridge University = = = At Fenner 's , Cambridge , 12 , 13 , 14 May . Cambridge University ( 167 and 196 ) lost to the Australians ( 414 / 4 declared ) by an innings and 51 runs . Cambridge elected to bat and wickets fell regularly . No player made over 33 and the hosts were out in the second session of the first day for 167 . Miller was prominent with the ball and in the field , taking 5 / 46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers . In reply , Australia were already 184 / 1 at stumps , with Brown heading for a consecutive century . He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence , who made 92 . Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter , prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414 / 4 , having reached 61 not out himself . In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool , who took 7 / 78 as the match ended early on the third morning . Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000 . = = = v Essex = = = At Southend , 15 , 17 May . The Australians ( 721 ) defeated Essex ( 83 and 187 ) by an innings and 451 runs . After electing to bat , Australia made history on the first day by breaking the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day . Ironically , it was the only time they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour . With centuries from Brown ( 153 ) , Bradman ( 187 ) , Loxton ( 120 ) and Saggers ( 104 * ) , Australia 's first innings totalled 721 ; they were dismissed on the close of the first day 's play . Bradman 's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown 's 153 lasted three hours ; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145 / 1 . Bradman came in and seized the initiative , reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch , including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore . Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364 / 2 only halfway through the day 's play . Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia 's merciless crushing of their hosts , something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman . Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had wanted to go to the local horse races , but this was refused by Bradman . The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest , but still did not get to go to the races . Later , Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket , before an late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5 / 57 , leaving Saggers unbeaten , but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career . After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen on the first day , Essex made only 83 in their first innings , capitulating within 37 overs . Toshack took 5 / 31 and Miller 3 / 14 , and Australia enforced the follow-on . Essex 's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46 / 6 . However , a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187 . Johnson ended with 6 / 37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day . The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record . = = = v Oxford University = = = At Oxford , 19 , 20 , 21 May . The Australians ( 431 ) defeated Oxford University ( 185 and 156 ) by an innings and 90 runs . Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss , and the opening pair of Brown and Morris put on 139 . Brown scored his third century in succession , before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108 . Morris , Loxton , McCool and Ring all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431 . Oxford 's best batting performance came in the form of a 75-run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings , resisting the spin bowlers on the dry wicket . Despite Kardar 's innings of 54 and 29 , the top-score in both innings , Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily . The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists ; Toshack took three in each innings , while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match . = = = v Marylebone Cricket Club = = = At Lord 's , 22 , 24 , 25 May . The Australians ( 552 ) defeated Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) ( 189 and 205 ) by an innings and 158 runs . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and with two other capped players , were basically a full strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first-choice team . Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage . After winning the toss , Australia batted first . After the loss of Morris early , Barnes ( 81 ) and Bradman ( 98 ) set about regaining the ascendancy with a 160-run stand . Bradman scored eleven fours in his 98 , which took two hours , and Hassett then took over and added 51 . Miller then saw Australia to stumps at 407 / 5 . He continued the next day and Australia 's highest scorer with 163 , and Johnson supported him with 80 . Despite a collapse which saw the last five wickets fall for 54 runs following the pair 's departure , Australia reached 552 . Bradman 's batsmen gained a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests by attacking the off spin of Jim Laker . They hit nine sixes from the English Test representative on the second morning . Miller and Lindwall then sought to gain an advantage over England 's leading batsmen \u2014 Hutton and Compton \u2014 before the Tests . The MCC side , composed almost entirely of Test players , reached 91 / 2 , Toshack removed Compton and Hutton in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 104 / 5 . He took three more wickets to end with 6 / 51 as the MCC were eventually dismissed for 189 , conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs . Some English observers decried Toshack 's leg stump attack as being negative , but former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack 's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played . Bradman opted to enforce the follow on , and his spinners did most of the damage , McCool taking 4 / 35 and Johnson 3 / 37 . Only Len Hutton of the locals batsmen passed 26 during the match , scoring 52 and 64 , and Australia had taken a key psychological victory ahead of the Tests with an innings victory . The total attendance was 60,000 . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Manchester , 26 , 27 , 28 May . The Australians ( 204 and 259 / 4 ) drew with Lancashire ( 182 ) . The first day was abandoned due to rain . Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch . The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman 's wicket twice in the match , causing a media sensation . Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11 , the Australian captain 's first score on tour below 80 . The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40 . Australia looked set to concede a lead for the first time on tour as the hosts reached 3 / 129 , but Johnston ( 5 / 49 ) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire 's only innings , which ended on the third morning . With a result impossible , Australia had time for batting practice . Bradman reached 43 , and when Hilton came on , the Australian captain , perhaps perturbed by earlier events , attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack . After missing the first two balls , Bradman charged the third , swung and missed , fell over and was stumped . Harvey ( 76 * ) and Hamence ( 49 * ) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52 . = = = v Nottinghamshire = = = At Nottingham , 29 , 31 May 1 June . Nottinghamshire ( 179 and 299 / 8 ) drew with the Australians ( 400 ) . In Nottinghamshire 's first innings , Ray Lindwall took 6 / 14 from 15.1 overs , with only 10 scoring strokes being made off him . Reg Simpson made 74 and Joe Hardstaff junior 48 , but only one other batsman reached double figures . After their 98-run third-wicket stand was broken , Australia took 8 / 68 to bowl the hosts out for 179 . Lindwall , conceded less than a run per over . Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls . Fingleton said that Lindwall \" absolutely paralysed \" the batsmen , with some of his bowling \" in the real Larwood manner \" . Australia only batted once , and Brown top-scored with 122 in 3 hours 45 minutes , while Bradman added 86 . The Australia middle-order fell away and the tourists lost their last six wickets for 74 runs . In the county 's second innings , Keeton was hit in the chest by one of Lindwall 's deliveries and took no further part in the match . On the final day , Hardstaff hit the first century against the Australians on the tour , 107 , and Simpson again batted well , making 70 . Lindwall and the Australian pacemen were less incisive in the second innings , and Ring and Johnson took four and three wickets respectively . = = = v Hampshire = = = At Southampton , 2 , 3 , 4 June . Hampshire ( 195 and 103 ) lost to the Australians ( 117 and 182 / 2 ) by eight wickets . Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat against the Australians , who were led by Hassett while Bradman rested . The Australians were behind on the first innings for the first time on the tour and the match remained in the balance until the third afternoon . On a drying pitch , the hosts reached 116 / 3 before losing their remaining wickets for 79 to be all out for 195 , while Johnston took 6 / 74 . In reply , Australia fared worse and collapsed from 2 / 70 and made only 117 . Charles Knott 's off spin proved challenging for the Australians , but Miller scored three successive sixes from him before the collapse , top-scoring with 39 . In their second innings , both Miller and Johnston took five Hampshire wickets . John Arnold top-scored for the hosts in both innings , with 48 and 42 . Australia needed 182 runs in 175 minutes to win . Barnes went for a duck but Johnson , sent in five minutes before lunch , hit 74 out of a second-wicket partnership of 105 , including three sixes and seven fours . Brown , with 81 not out , and Hassett saw the Australians through to victory . = = = v Sussex = = = At Hove , 5 , 7 June . Sussex ( 86 and 138 ) lost to the Australians ( 549 / 5 declared ) by an innings and 325 runs . Lindwall won the match for the Australians with his bowling , taking 11 / 59 . After winning the toss , the Sussex batsmen struggled with his length and variation of pace , and he hit the off-stump five times in the first innings alone to end with 6 / 34 . Loxton also bowled well in the first innings , taking 3 / 13 . Australia replied to Sussex 's 86 strongly , and were already 254 / 1 by the end of the first day . Powered by Morris 's 184 and with centuries too for Bradman ( 109 ) and Harvey ( 100 * ) , Australia added a further 295 runs on the second day to declare at 549 / 5 . They then still had time to send down 63.3 overs , enough to finish the match within two days . In Sussex 's second innings Lindwall took two wickets in the first over . Harry Parks made 61 , but Sussex were all out for 138 , losing their last seven wickets for 59 . In all , eight of Lindwall 's wickets were bowled , five these by swinging yorkers , the batsmen unable to counter the swerving deliveries . Fingleton said that \" Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions \" as Sussex \" crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew \" . At the other end , Toshack helped to pin down the batsmen for Lindwall . He delivered 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs . = = = v Northamptonshire = = = At Northampton , 16 , 17 , 18 June . Northamptonshire ( 119 and 169 ) lost to the Australians ( 352 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 64 runs . Starting the day after the First Test , the Northamptonshire match was interrupted by rain . Northamptonshire batted first and collapsed to 7 / 61 before some tail-end resistance took them to 119 ; Johnston and Johnson took three wickets each . The Australians passed the locals ' score on the first afternoon , and their innings was built around Hassett 's 127 , which included 17 fours . Morris and McCool also made fifties . Northamptonshire made 169 runs in their second innings , Johnston and Ring taking four wickets each . In neither of the county innings did any player reach 50 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Sheffield , 19 , 21 , 22 June . The Australians ( 249 and 285 / 5 declared ) drew with Yorkshire ( 206 and 85 / 4 ) . The Australians were made to work hard for their 249 , with only Bradman reaching 50 . Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores . Alec Coxon took 4 / 66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test . Yorkshire made 206 in reply , Toshack taking 7 / 81 and Johnston 3 / 101 : together , they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings . Like the Australians , the local batsmen struggled to make the most of their starts ; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40 . Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test , Bradman declared Australia 's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining . Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86 , putting on 154 for the second wicket . Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to the upper half of the order in the second innings . The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result . Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw . The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 30 June , 1 \u2013 2 July . Surrey ( 221 and 289 ) lost to The Australians ( 389 and 122 / 0 ) by 10 wickets . Australia won the toss and sent Surrey in to bat . They made 221 , and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort in which there were six single-figure scores . As the match started the day after the Second Test , Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers , and Ring took three wickets , while the Test players only took two in total . Hamence opened the batting for Australia \u2014 Brown injured a finger while fielding \u2014 but he was out for a duck . Hassett ( 139 ) and Bradman ( 128 ) then put on 231 , Bradman making his sixth century of the tour . However , the Australians lost wickets steadily thereafter to be all out for 389 . Surrey made 289 in their second innings , with McCool taking 6 / 113 after bowling more than 40 % of the overs . The hosts batted steadily with three fifties , but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised . The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time . = = = v Gloucestershire = = = At Bristol , 3 , 5 , 6 July . The Australians ( 774 / 7 declared ) defeated Gloucestershire ( 279 and 132 ) by an innings and 363 runs . The Australians elected to bat and made the highest score of the tour , and it was also the second biggest score by an Australian team in England ( the 1893 team made 843 against a \" Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present \" at Portsmouth ) , and the highest score by an Australian team versus an English county . Morris 's 290 , made from 466 balls in five hours , was the highest individual score of the tour , and he featured in century stands with Barnes , Miller and Harvey . Loxton made 159 not out , Harvey 95 and McCool 76 . This match preceded the Third Test , and off spinner Tom Goddard was regarded as a candidate for England selection after strong performances in county cricket . However , Morris and Loxton 's aggressive attack gave Goddard figures of 0 / 186 from 32 overs , effectively ending his chances of selection . Former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \" Tom [ Goddard ] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [ shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking ] to him and that gets him many wickets . \" Instead , it was Loxton who forced his way into the Third Test . Gloucestershire replied with an innings of 279 , in which Jack Crapp made 100 not out , while Johnson took 6 / 68 . Made to follow on during the final day , the hosts made only 132 , losing their last eight wickets for 60 . Johnson took 5 / 32 to end with 11 / 100 for the match , while Ring took 5 / 47 to end with seven for the match . Australia 's spinners took 19 wickets . = = = v Middlesex = = = At Lord 's , 17 , 19 , 20 July . Middlesex ( 203 and 135 ) lost to the Australians ( 317 and 22 / 0 ) by ten wickets . Denis Compton hit a cautious 62 , but Middlesex lost wickets regularly to fall from 1 / 78 to 203 all out . Five bowlers shared the wickets , Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece . At one stage , Australia were 53 / 3 , but Morris ( 109 ) and Loxton ( 123 ) put on a partnership of 172 . No other batsman bettered Hamence 's 30 , and Jim Sims took 6 / 65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46 . Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings , with only John Dewes ( 51 ) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists , while eight managed only single figures . Five bowlers shared the wickets , and McCool was the only one to take three . McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs . = = = v Derbyshire = = = At Derby , 28 , 29 , 30 July . The Australians ( 456 ) defeated Derbyshire ( 240 and 182 ) by an innings and 34 runs . The Australians chose to bat first , and Brown top scored with 140 , his first 50 taking three hours . He shared century stands with Bradman , who made 62 , and Miller ( 57 ) . Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away late in the innings , losing 7 / 142 . Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57 , while Miller , Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece . The county followed on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs . In their second innings they made 182 , with Denis Smith making 88 , the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians . However , only one other player reached double figures , as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9 / 72 , taking 6 / 77 , while Loxton took 3 / 16 . There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17,000 on the first day . = = = v Glamorgan = = = At Swansea , 31 July , 2 \u2013 3 August . Glamorgan ( 197 ) drew with the Australians ( 215 / 3 ) . Rain prevented play after 3pm on the second day . No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197 , with the four Australian bowlers , Lindwall , Miller , Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets . The Australians ' 215 / 3 was based on an aggressive 84 from Miller , with five sixes and seven fours , and a partnership of 126 with stand-in Hassett , who was 71 not out when the rain came . The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50,000 . = = = v Warwickshire = = = At Birmingham , 4 , 5 , 6 August . Warwickshire ( 138 and 155 ) lost to the Australians ( 254 and 41 / 1 ) by nine wickets . Bradman put Warwickshire in to bat on a wet pitch and the hosts struggled to 138 in an innings that lasted almost 80 overs . Martin Donnelly ( 28 ) was the only batsman to pass 20 , and Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets each . Australia scored 254 in reply ; Hassett top-scored with 68 , Lindwall made 45 , and the pair 's partnership of 70 was the highest of the match . Three other batsmen reached 30 , but most of the Australians were uncomfortable against the leg spin of Eric Hollies , who opened the bowling and took 8 / 107 , the best innings analysis against the Australians on the whole tour . This performance earned the Warwickshire bowler a call-up for the fifth and final Test . In their second innings Warwickshire made 155 runs , Johnston and McCool taking four wickets each , the former conceding only 32 from 39 overs . Australia made the required 41 by lunch on the third day . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Old Trafford , Manchester , 7 , 9 , 10 August . The Australians ( 321 and 265 / 3 declared ) drew with Lancashire ( 130 and 199 / 7 ) . Cyril Washbrook 's benefit match brought him a then record sum , \u00a3 14,000 , but it was a mixed experience because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test . The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes ( 67 ) reaching 50 . Nine of the Australians made a start , reaching 14 , but could not capitalise on their opportunities , and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123 . The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6 / 73 . Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38 , while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece , but the Australians did not enforce the follow on . Australia made 265 / 5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133 , his highest at Old Trafford , with 90 for Barnes . Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match , but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day . Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers . Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller , who refused to bowl , saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century . Lindwall ( 4 / 27 ) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century . = = = v Durham = = = At Sunderland , 11 , 12 August . The Australians ( 282 ) drew with Durham ( 73 / 5 ) . In the absence of the resting Bradman , Hassett won the toss and elected to bat . Attendance was 17,000 on the first day of this two-day non-first-class match . Rain prevented any play on the second day . After a poor start that saw them fall to 22 / 3 , McCool ( 64 ) and Miller ( 55 ) made half-centuries for the Australians . Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20 , but none went on . Paceman Keith Jackson took 5 / 76 for the hosts . Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match . = = = v Kent = = = At Canterbury , 21 , 23 August . The Australians ( 361 ) defeated Kent ( 51 and 124 ) by an innings and 186 runs . Australia elected to bat first and Brown made 106 , while Bradman ( 65 ) and Harvey ( 60 ) both scored half-centuries . Kent collapsed to the lowest score of the tour in the first innings , succumbing in only 23 overs . Johnston and Loxton both took 3 / 10 , and six local batsmen made ducks . Forced to follow on , half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings . Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71 , but the match , held in front of record crowds for the ground , ended inside two days , soon after Evans was run out . It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets . Lindwall took 4 / 37 in the second innings ; all his wickets were top-order batsmen . = = = v Gentlemen of England = = = At Lord 's , 25 , 26 , 27 August . The Australians ( 610 / 5 declared ) defeated the Gentlemen of England ( 245 and 284 ) by an innings and 81 runs . In his last match at Lord 's , Bradman won the toss and made his ninth century ( 150 ) of the tour against a side composed almost entirely of Test players . Brown ( 120 ) and Hassett ( 200 * ) also scored centuries , and Miller made 69 . Bradman elected to bat into the second day . The Gentlemen responded with 242 of which Reg Simpson made 60 and , following on , 284 , with Bill Edrich making 128 . There were no other scores beyond 30 in either innings . Ring took 5 / 70 for the innings and eight for the match , while Johnson secured seven wickets . The Victorian spin duo bowled the majority of the overs in both innings . = = = v Somerset = = = At Taunton , 28 , 30 August . The Australians ( 560 / 5 declared ) defeated Somerset ( 115 and 71 ) by an innings and 374 runs . After winning the toss , the Australians made all their runs on the first day , with centuries for Hassett ( 103 ) , Harvey ( 126 ) and Johnson ( 113 * ) and 99 for Hamence . The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket , through Hassett and Barnes , who was replaced by Harvey after retiring ill . The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries , and were keen to see Hamence do the same . The rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone , only to see him stumped for 99 , his highest score for the season . On the Monday , the second day , on a pitch that was taking spin , Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total . McCool took 4 / 21 and 4 / 23 , and Johnston also took eight , including 5 / 34 in the second innings . He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner , and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls . = = = v South of England = = = At Hastings , 1 , 2 , 3 September . The Australians ( 522 / 7 declared ) drew with the South of England ( 298 ) . The tourists elected to bat and after losing the openers early , Hassett top scored with 151 , his third consecutive century . He was supported by Bradman ( 143 ) and Harvey ( 110 ) , whose quick scoring enabled the Australians to declare with a large total . Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman and Harvey . Harvey 's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day . The second and third days were continually interrupted by rain , and Compton made 82 in the showers . Bradman gave his regular bowlers a light workload and Brown took 4 / 16 in 4.1 overs to finish off the tail , the only time he bowled in first-class matches on the entire tour . There was no time left for the second innings . = = = v HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI = = = At Scarborough , 8 , 9 , 10 September . HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI ( 177 and 75 / 2 ) drew with the Australians ( 489 / 8 declared ) . This was the final match for Bradman in England , and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions . It was Australia 's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches . During the last Australian campaign in 1938 , this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full-strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Ring . The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat , but Lindwall took 6 / 59 in an innings that lasted into the second day , bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs . Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively , sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62 . Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face , breaking his nose . Australia reached 2 / 407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8 / 469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result . Leveson-Gower 's XI played out time , with Bradman bowling the last over . = = = v Scotland = = = At Edinburgh , 13 , 14 September . The Australians ( 236 ) defeated Scotland ( 85 and 111 ) by an innings and 40 runs . The match against Scotland was a two-day fixture that did not have first-class status . Australia elected to bat and Morris top-scored with 112 , and McCool made 52 , but all struggled against the leg-spin of William Laidlaw , who took 5 / 51 . The Australians collapsed at the end , losing their last six wickets for 36 runs , and only three made double figures . Scotland collapsed against Johnston and Johnson , who took 6 / 15 and 3 / 18 respectively . Forced to follow on , a second innings opening stand of 50 preceded a second collapse , this time Ring and Morris took 4 / 20 and 5 / 10 . Only three Scottish players passed double figures in either innings . = = = v Scotland = = = At Aberdeen , 17 , 18 September . Scotland ( 178 and 142 ) lost to the Australians ( 407 / 6 declared ) by an innings and 87 runs . In another two-day non-first-class match , Scotland batted better than in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat , but still lost . Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts ' 178 , before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool , promoted to open , made 108 , while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5 . Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring . Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball , and the wickets were shared , with nobody taking more than four .",

                    "text": "Mediterranean cuisine = Mediterranean cuisine is the food from the lands around the Mediterranean Sea and its preparation . This geographical area broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree , which provides one of the most distinctive features of the region 's cooking , olive oil . Although this region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines , the historical connections of the region , as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region 's climate and economy , mean that there are common elements in these cuisines , which include Italian , Levantine , Maghrebi , Ottoman , Proven\u00e7al ( French ) , and Spanish cuisines . The region 's food came to be seen as a more or less unified cuisine following the cookery writer Elizabeth David 's book , A Book of Mediterranean Food ( 1950 ) . Other writers , such as the Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid , have agreed with David , defining the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive , wheat , and the grape , yielding oil , bread and pasta , and wine , respectively . The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet , made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil , wheat and other grains , fruits , vegetables , and a certain amount of seafood , but low in meat and dairy products . Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients , including meat , are dealt with in the kitchen , whether they are healthgiving or not . = = Geography = = = = = By city and country = = = The cookery writer Elizabeth David 's introduction to A Book of Mediterranean Food ( 1950 ) defines her scope as \" the cooking of the Mediterranean shores \" . She sketches out the geographical limits as from Gibraltar to the Bosphorus , down the Rhone Valley , through the great seaports of Marseilles , Barcelona , and Genoa , across to Tunis and Alexandria , embracing all the Mediterranean islands , Corsica , Sicily , Sardinia , Crete , the Cyclades , Cyprus ( where the Byzantine influence begins to be felt ) , to the mainland of Greece and the much disputed territories of Syria , the Lebanon , Constantinople , and Smyrna . = = = By a key culinary plant = = = David defines the region as coextensive with the range of the olive tree : \" those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees \" . The olive 's natural distribution is limited by frost and by availability of water . It is therefore constrained to a more or less narrow zone around the Mediterranean Sea , except in the Maghreb and in Spain , where it is distributed more widely , and on the islands of the Mediterranean , where it is widespread . It does not grow in most of France , most of the north of Italy ( except Liguria ) , or the inland regions of the Balkans . The Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid similarly defines the region by the olive 's presence , along with bread , wheat , and the grape as the \" basic products of Mediterranean folk cuisine \" : Mediterranean cuisine is defined by the presence of fundamental elements which are said to play a more important role than others , reflecting a community of beliefs and practices which transcend religions , languages and even societies . The olive tree , the emblematic tree on more than one account , traces the bounds of a frontier of landscapes and lives on either side of which the Mediterranean begins or ends . Above Montelimar , nicknamed \" Gates of Provence \" , is the limit of the olive . = = Key ingredients = = Essid , as already mentioned , identifies the \" trinity \" of basic ingredients of traditional Mediterranean cuisine as the olive , wheat , and the grape , yielding oil , bread , and wine respectively . The archaeologist Colin Renfrew calls this the \" Mediterranean triad \" . = = = Olive = = = The olive appears to come from the region of Persia and Mesopotamia , at least 6,000 years ago . It spread from there to nearby areas , and has been cultivated since the early Bronze Age ( up to 3,150 BC ) in southern Turkey , the Levant , and Crete . The ten countries with the largest harvests ( in 2011 ) are all near the Mediterranean ( Portugal being the tenth largest ) : together , they produce 95 % of the world 's olives . The olive yields bitter fruits , made edible by curing and fermentation , and olive oil . Some 90 % of the fruit production ( 1996 ) goes into olive oil . The Mediterranean region accounts for the world 's highest consumption of olive oil : in 2014 , the highest-consuming country , Greece , used 17 kg per head ; Italy , 12 kg , Spain 3 kg ; the United States for comparison used only 1 kg per head . = = = Wheat = = = Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent , in and near the Levant some 10,000 years ago . Its ancestors include wild emmer wheat ; this was hybridised , harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains , in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms . It had been spread across the Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5,000 BC . Wheat is a staple food in the Mediterranean region . Wheat bread was already critically important in the empire of Ancient Rome , which included the entire region ; at that time , around 2,000 years ago , North Africa was the \" breadbasket \" of the empire . Other staple wheat-based Mediterranean foods include pasta and semolina ( wheat middlings ) products such as couscous and burgul . In turn , these are made into dishes such as the Greek dessert galaktoboureko ( milk b\u00f6rek ) , consisting of filo pastry parcels around a custard made with semolina . A widespread wheat dish from Turkey and the Levant to Iran and India is halva , a dessert of sweetened semolina with butter , milk , and pine kernels . = = = Grape = = = The grape was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC between the Black Sea and Persia ; archaeological evidence shows that wine was being made there by 6,000 BC , reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC . Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC , and in France around 600 BC . Grapes are grown for making wine , for drying as raisins , or for eating as table grapes . Wine grapes are often rich in tannins , while raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour . Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area , with a large part of the world 's harvest . Italy produced 8 million tonnes ( mt ) in 2013 ; Spain 7.5 mt ; France 5.5 mt ; Turkey 4.0 mt ; Egypt 1.4 mt ; Greece 0.9 mt ; Algeria 0.6 mt . Wine production is similarly large , with France 4.3 mt ; Italy 4.1 mt ; Spain 3.2 mt , but with much lower figures from the Muslim countries . = = History = = = = = Concept = = = The concept of a Mediterranean cuisine is very recent , probably dating from the publication of David 's A Book of Mediterranean Food ( 1950 ) . David herself did not use the term , speaking instead of Mediterranean \" food \" , \" cookery \" , or \" cooking \" . The usefulness of the concept is disputed . Carol Helstosky , author of the book Food Culture in the Mediterranean ( 2009 ) , is among the authors who use \" Mediterranean cuisine \" interchangeably with \" Mediterranean food \" . In the preface to her book she writes Mediterranean food is incredibly popular : pasta , pizza , gyros , kebab , and falafel can be found just about everywhere . Food experts and cookbook authors adore Mediterranean cuisine ... Essid acknowledges that \" geographical differences and the vicissitudes of history \" have affected the food of different Mediterranean lands , but nonetheless asserts that : Rules for the preparation and consumption of food are common to the lands that border the Mediterranean . They offer both stability , continuity and reproduction of a specific pattern of eating which resists conquest , invasion , colonisation , social change , industrialisation and urbanisation . Consequently , wherever you go , in southern Europe or the lands bordering the southern Mediterranean , you will find a cuisine and gastronomic ritual which is always familiar . On the other hand , Sami Zubaida argues in his book Culinary Cultures of the Middle East ( 1994 ) that : The idea of the \" standard Mediterranean \" ... is a modern construction of food writers and publicists in Europe and North America earnestly preaching what is now thought to be a healthy diet to their audiences by invoking a stereotype of the healthy other on the shores of the Mediterranean . Their colleagues in Mediterranean countries are only too willing to perpetuate this myth . The fact of the matter is that the Mediterranean contains varied cultures . The cookery author Clifford A. Wright wrote in 1999 : \" There really is no such thing as ' Mediterranean cuisine ' . At the same time , we seem to know what we mean when we use the expression .... \" Wright argued that David 's book itself was largely about specifically French Mediterranean food , pointing out that \" only 4 percent of her recipes come from North Africa or the Levant \" . Since David 's time , a variety of books on Mediterranean cuisine have been written , including Helstosky 's 2009 book , already mentioned ; books by other cookery writers include S. Rowe 's Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume : Cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean ( 2011 ) ; Mari-Pierre Moine 's Mediterranean Cookbook ( 2014 ) ; and J. R. Stevens ' Mediterranean Cuisine ( 2015 ) . There are many more cookbooks covering specific cuisines in the Mediterranean area , such as B. Santich 's The Original Mediterranean Cuisine : Medieval Recipes for Today ( 1995 ) , on Catalan and Italian recipes ; H. F. Ullman 's on the cooking of Tunisia ( 2006 ) , Spain and Italy , each one subtitled \" Mediterranean Cuisine \" . = = = Origins = = = The ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine are to an extent different from those of the cuisine of Northern Europe , with olive oil instead of butter , wine instead of beer . The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries . One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal , Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages . Those foods included aubergines , spinach , sugar cane , rice , apricots and citrus fruits , creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus . Another major change was the arrival of foods from the Americas in Early Modern times ( around the sixteenth century ) , notably the incorporation of the potato into Northern European cuisine , and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine . The tomato , so central now to that cuisine , was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544 . Similarly , many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean , including P. vulgaris ( the French or haricot bean ) , were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers . = = Cooking = = David 's introduction to her 1950 book characterises the cooking of the Mediterranean countries as \" conditioned naturally by variations in climate and soil and the relative industry or indolence of the inhabitants . \" David identifies \" the ever recurring elements \" in the food of this extensive region as olive oil , saffron , garlic , \" pungent \" local wines , as well as the \" aromatic perfume \" of herbs , especially rosemary , wild marjoram , and basil , and the bright colours of fresh foods in the markets , \" pimentos , aubergines , tomatoes , olives , melons , figs \" and \" shiny fish , silver , vermilion , or tiger-striped \" . She includes cheeses of \" sheep 's or goat 's milk \" , \" figs from Smyrna on long strings \" and \" sheets of apricot paste which is dissolved in water to make a cooling drink . \" With common ingredients including the olive , wheat , and grape ; a shared climate ; and a long period for cultural exchange , it might be expected that a single , pan-Mediterranean cuisine would have developed . Certain items , such as olive oil , bread , wine , roast lamb or mutton ( for example , Maghreb m\u00e9choui , Greek kleftiko and souvlaki , Turkish shish kebab ) , bottarga , and stews of meat with vegetables and tomato ( such as Spanish andrajos , French estouffade \u00e0 la Proven\u00e7ale , Italian ciambotta , Turkish bu\u011fu kebab\u0131 ) , are indeed found all around the Mediterranean . Despite this , however , the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines , from the Maghreb , Levant and Ottoman to the Italian , French , and Spanish . Each of those , in turn , has national and provincial variations . = = = Maghrebi = = = Maghrebi cuisine includes the cuisines of Algeria , Libya , Morocco , and Tunisia . One of the most characteristic dishes of the region is couscous , a steamed , small-grained wheat semolina , served with a stew . The dish is ancient , mentioned by the Medieval traveller Ibn Battuta , and found for example also in Italian cuisine , at Genoa , Livorno and Trapani . One stew that may be served with couscous is the Moroccan tagine , a hearty , somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables , cooked slowly in a pot ( called a tagine ) with a tall conical lid . Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout ( containing such spices as cumin , coriander , saffron , cinnamon , cloves , chillies , and paprika ) . Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins . = = = Levantine = = = Levantine cuisine is the cooking of the Levant ( including the Middle Eastern Mediterranean coast , east of Egypt ) . Among the most distinctive foods of this cuisine are traditional small meze dishes such as tabbouleh , hummus , and baba ghanoush . Tabbouleh is a dish of bulgur cracked wheat with tomatoes , parsley , mint and onion , dressed with olive oil and lemon juice . Baba ghanoush , sometimes called \" poor man 's caviar \" , is a puree of aubergine with olive oil , often mixed with chopped onion , tomato , cumin , garlic , lemon juice , and parsley . The dish is popular across the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa . Ful medames , originally from Egypt and still a national dish there , consists of fava beans with oil and cumin ; it is popular throughout the Levant . The dish may be ancient : dried beans of Neolithic age have been found near Nazareth . = = = Ottoman = = = Ottoman cuisine has given rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey , parts of the Balkans , Cyprus , and Greece . A distinctive element is the family of small flaky pastries called b\u00f6rek . These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region , and date as far back as ancient Roman times . B\u00f6rek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry , filled with mixtures such as meat , caramelised onion and sweet peppers . Another widespread and popular dish is moussaka , a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients : often minced meat and tomatoes , sometimes a layer of egg custard or b\u00e9chamel sauce on top . In its Greek variant , well-known outside the region , it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or b\u00e9chamel sauce on top , but that version is a relatively recent innovation , introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s . = = = Greek = = = Much of Greek cuisine is part of the larger tradition of Ottoman cuisine , the names of the dishes revealing Arabic , Persian or Turkish roots : moussaka , tzatziki , yuvarlakia , keftethes , boureki , and so on . Many dishes ' names probably entered the Greek vocabulary during Ottoman times , or earlier in contact with the Persians and the Arabs . However , some dishes may be pre-Ottoman , only taking Turkish names later ; Ash and Dalby , for example , speculate that grape-leaf dolmathes were made by the early Byzantine period . Greek cookery makes wide use of vegetables , olive oil , grains , fish , wine and meat ( white and red , including lamb , poultry , rabbit and pork ) . Other important ingredients include olives , cheese , eggplant ( aubergine ) , zucchini ( courgette ) , lemon juice , vegetables , herbs , bread and yoghurt . Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece : lentil soup , fasolada , retsina ( white or ros\u00e9 wine flavored with pine resin ) and pasteli ( candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey ) ; some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods : loukaniko ( dried pork sausage ) ; and Byzantium : feta cheese , avgotaraho ( botargo , cured fish roe ) and paximadi ( traditional hard bread baked from corn , barley and rye ) . = = = Italian = = = Mediterranean Italian cuisine includes much of Italy outside the north and the mountainous inland regions . It is a diverse cuisine , but among its best-known and most characteristic foods are risotto , pizza in Neapolitan and Sicilian styles , and pasta dishes such as spaghetti . Risotto is a dish made using Italian short-grain rice , which is both highly absorbent and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with stock and flavoured with onions and garlic , cooked in butter . Anna Gosetti della Salda 's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes , 18 of them from the Veneto . Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine ; chicken ; eel ; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese ; quails ; small pieces of beef ; courgettes ( zucchini ) ; clams ; Rag\u00f9 ; beans ; mussels ; prawns ; cuttlefish ; and asparagus . Pizza , or as David notes \" pissaladina or pissaladi\u00e8re \" in Provence ( the cuisines of Mediterranean France and Italy having something in common ) , is a piece of bread dough rolled out thin , with a topping which varies from place to place , but is generally much simpler than those in the English-speaking world . In Naples this is tomato , anchovies and buffalo mozzarella . In San Remo it is onions cooked in olive oil , with salted sardines . The Proven\u00e7al variety uses onions , black olives , and anchovies . Spaghetti dishes also vary . It may be eaten as David says \" simply with olive oil and garlic \" , without cheese , or with a sauce of \" very red and ripe peeled tomatoes \" , cooked briefly and flavoured with garlic and either basil or parsley . One Sicilian variant includes pieces of bacon , onions fried in fat , garlic , stoned olives , and anchovies , served with olive oil and grated Parmesan cheese . = = = French = = = Mediterranean French cuisine includes the cooking styles of Provence , Occitania , and the island of Corsica . Distinctive dishes that make use of local ingredients include bouillabaisse and salade ni\u00e7oise . Bouillabaisse is a substantial dish from the French port of Marseille , capital of Provence . It is a stew for at least eight people , because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish , gurnard , weever , John Dory , monkfish , conger eel , whiting , sea bass , and crab . These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs , namely onions , garlic , tomatoes , thyme , fennel , parsley , bay , and orange peel . Salade ni\u00e7oise is a colourful salad of tomatoes , tuna , hard-boiled eggs , Ni\u00e7oise olives , and anchovies , dressed with a vinaigrette . = = = Spanish = = = Spain 's varied cuisine includes the cooking of Andalusia , Catalonia , Valencia , and the Balearic islands . Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish , originally from Valencia and now popular across a much wider area , made in many versions . It may contain a mixture of chicken , pork , and shellfish , fried in oil in a large shallow pan , with vegetable flavourings , and long-grain rice cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron . Other local ingredients may include artichoke hearts , peas , sweet peppers , sausages and so on . = = Mediterranean diet and cuisine = = The Mediterranean diet , popularised in the 1970s , is sometimes conflated with Mediterranean cuisine . Thus , the American Diabetes Association writes about \" Mediterranean-Style Eating \" , mentioning \" the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle ... of ... eating healthfully together among family and friends \" , and asserting that \" Mediterranean cuisine is plant-based \" , citing the ingredients \" whole grains , fruits , vegetables , herbs and spices , beans , nuts , seeds , and olive oil \" , and stating that most foods \" in a Mediterranean diet come from plants \" . The 1984 travel guide Guida all 'Italia gastronomica states that \" around 1975 , under the impulse of one of those new nutritional directives by which good cooking is too often influenced , the Americans discovered the so-called Mediterranean diet . The name even pleased Italian government officials , who made one modification : changing from diet \u2014 a word which has always seemed punitive and therefore unpleasant \u2014 to Mediterranean cuisine . \" \" Mediterranean diet \" as popularly understood may have little to do with either Mediterranean cuisine or indeed the traditional Mediterranean diet based on the trinity of wheat , olive , and grape . Thus , Judy Lance 's book Low Carb Eating : How a Wheat Free Menu , or Mediterranean Diet Can Help with Weight Loss advocates a diet called Mediterranean , but lacking the wheat staple entirely . = = A changing cuisine = = Since David wrote about Mediterranean food in 1950 , and indeed since dietary researchers showed in the 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less coronary heart disease than the peoples of northern Europe , the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed . Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables : their diet is becoming more northern European , with more convenience foods and with less of a preventative effect on cardiovascular disease .",

                    "text": "Fried chicken = Fried chicken ( also referred to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States ) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried , deep fried , or pressure fried . The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior . What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints , and the bones and skin are left intact . Crisp well-seasoned skin , rendered of excess fat , is a hallmark of well made fried chicken . The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters , which were popular in the Middle Ages . However , it was the Scottish who were the first to deep fry their chicken . The dish was first brought to the United States by Scottish immigrants . Prior to the Second World War , fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions . In the late 1900s and early 2000s , however , fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly . When being cooked , fried chicken is often divided into smaller pieces . The chicken is then generally covered in a batter , often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk . This is used to create a crust on the exterior of the meat . In addition , seasoning is often added at this stage . Once the chicken is ready to be cooked , it is placed in a deep fryer , frying pan or pressure cooker ( depending on the method used ) and fried in lard or a type of oil . The dish has created a large number of spin-off recipes which are commonly used around the world . For example , Korean fried chicken , a dish which is commonly served as fast food in Korea and is known for being crispier than normal fried chicken . There is also a racial stereotype surrounding fried chicken and African-American people , mostly because it was popular among slaves in the American Civil War . = = History = = Fritters have existed in Europe since the middle ages ( from the 5th to the 15th century ) . The Scots had a tradition of deep frying chicken in fat , unlike their English counterparts who baked or boiled chicken . Scottish immigrants to America continued this frying chicken tradition and are responsible for the introduction of it to African slaves . A number of West African cuisines featured dishes where chicken was fried , typically in palm oil , sometimes having been battered before . These would be served on special occasions in some areas , or sometimes sold in the streets as snacks in others . This provided some means of independent economy for enslaved and segregated African-American women , who became noted sellers of poultry ( live or cooked ) as early as the 1730s . Because of this and the expensive nature of the ingredients , it was , despite popular perception , a rare and special dish in the African-American community . After the development of larger and faster-growing hogs ( due to crosses between European and Asian breeds ) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States , backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food , crop waste , and garbage into calories ( in a relatively small space and in a relatively short period of time ) . Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard . Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods ( many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods ) like biscuits and pies . The economic / caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods , not only in the US , but worldwide . In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking . The combination of flour , lard , a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today 's fried chicken . When it was introduced to the American South , fried chicken became a common staple . Later , as the slave trade led to Africans being brought to work on southern plantations , the slaves who became cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional Scottish cuisine , enriching the flavor . Since most slaves were unable to raise expensive meats , but generally allowed to keep chickens , frying chicken on special occasions continued in the African-American communities of the South . It endured the fall of slavery and gradually passed into common use as a general Southern dish . Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace , it gained further favor in the periods of American history when segregation closed off most restaurants to the black population . Fried chicken continues to be among this region 's top choices for \" Sunday dinner \" . Holidays such as Independence Day and other gatherings often feature this dish . Since the American Civil War , traditional slave foods like fried chicken , watermelon , and chitterlings have suffered a strong association with African-American stereotypes and blackface minstrelsy . This was commercialized for the first half of the 20th century by restaurants like Sambo 's and Coon Chicken Inn , which selected exaggerated depictions of blacks as mascots , implying quality by their association with the stereotype . Although also being acknowledged positively as \" soul food \" today , the affinity that African-American culture has for fried chicken has been considered a delicate , often pejorative issue . While the perception of fried chicken as an ethnic dish has been fading for several decades , with the ubiquity of fried chicken dishes in the US , it persists as a racial stereotype . Before the industrialization of chicken production , and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken , only young spring chickens ( pullets or cockerels ) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying , making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer . Older , tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures . To compensate for this , sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender , allowed to cool and dry , and then fried . ( This method is common in Australia . ) Another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method . The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid , usually , a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in . This process ( of flouring , frying and simmering in gravy ) is known as \" smothering \" and can be used for other tough cuts of meat , such as swiss steak . Smothered chicken is still consumed today , though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens , or who seek out stewing hens , it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens . = = Description = = Fried chicken has been described as being \" crunchy \" and \" juicy \" , as well as \" crispy \" . In addition , the dish has also been called \" spicy \" and \" salty \" . Occasionally , fried chicken is also topped with a chili like paprika , or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste . This is especially common in fast food restaurants and chains such as KFC . The dish is renowned for being greasy and unhealthy , especially when coming from fast food outlets . Out of the various parts of the animal used in fried chicken , the wings generally tend to contain the most fat , with almost 40 grams ( 0.088 lb ) of fat for every 100 grams ( 0.22 lb ) . However , the average whole fried chicken contains only around 12 % fat , or 12 grams ( 0.026 lb ) per every 100 grams ( 0.22 lb ) . As well as this , 100 grams ( 0.22 lb ) grams of fried chicken generally contains around 240 calories of energy . One of the main causes of the large amounts of fat which can be found in fried chicken is the oil which is used to cook it . Vegetable oil , one of the most common oils used to cook fried chicken and other fried foods , consists mainly of fat and a large number of calories . = = Preparation = = Generally , chickens are not fried whole ; instead , the chicken is divided into its constituent pieces . The two white meat sections are the breast and the wing from the front of the chicken , while the dark meat sections are the thigh and leg or \" drumstick \" , are from the rear of the chicken . These pieces are usually subdivided into the wings , the breasts ( the wishbone is often cut out first in home cooking ) , the legs , and the thighs . The ribs are sometimes left on the breast , but commercially they and the back are usually discarded . To prepare the chicken pieces for frying , they may be coated in a batter of flour and liquid ( and seasonings ) mixed together . The batter can contain ingredients like eggs , milk , and leavening . Alternatively , they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance , to coat the meat and to develop a crust . Seasonings such as salt , pepper , cayenne pepper , paprika , garlic powder , onion powder , or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour . Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk . As the pieces of chicken cook , some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour , creating a flavorful crust . According to Nathan Bailey 's 1736 cookbook , Dictionarium Domesticum , for example , the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons , malt vinegar , bay leaves , salt , pepper , ground cloves , and green onions ; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour , white wine , three egg yolks and salt , and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil , lard , or clarified butter over an open fire . It can then be topped with fresh , dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil . Traditionally , lard is used to fry the chicken , but corn oil , peanut oil , canola oil , or vegetable oil are also frequently used ( although clarified butter may be used as well like in colonial times ) . The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken , and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use . There are three main techniques for frying chickens : pan frying , deep frying and broasting . Pan frying ( or shallow frying ) requires a frying pan of sturdy construction and a source of fat that does not fully immerse the chicken . The chicken pieces are prepared as above , then fried . Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal ( without browning , at this point ) the outside of the chicken pieces . Once the pieces have been added to the hot fat and sealed , the temperature is reduced . There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces , with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning , and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary . Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color ( some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning ) . The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy . Deep frying requires a deep fryer or other device in which the chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat . The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it at a very high temperature . The pieces are prepared as described above . The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature . The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process . Broasting uses a pressure cooker to accelerate the process . The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker , lowering the cooking temperature needed . The steam also cooks the chicken through , but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating . Fat is heated in a pressure cooker . Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat . The lid is placed on the pressure cooker , and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure . The derivative phrases \" country fried \" and \" chicken fried \" often refer to other foods prepared in the manner of fried chicken . Usually , this means a boneless , tenderized piece of meat that has been floured or battered and cooked in any of the methods described above or simply chicken which is cooked outdoors . Chicken fried steak and \" country fried \" boneless chicken breast are two common examples . = = Global variants = = Throughout the world , different seasoning and spices are used to augment the flavor of fried chicken . Because of the versatility of fried chicken , it is not uncommon to flavor the chicken 's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory . Depending on regional market ubiquity , local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors , or may appear on menus without notation . With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming , many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken , tweaking recipes to suit local preferences . = = = North America = = = Barberton Chicken : also known as Serbian Fried Chicken , created by Serbian immigrants in Barberton , Ohio and has been popularized throughout Ohio . Buffalo wings : Named for their place of origin , Buffalo , New York , this is one of the few kinds of fried chicken that is not traditionally battered before frying . Buffalo strips , fingers , crisp wings and boneless wings : using the same cayenne-pepper sauce as Buffalo wings , these chicken products are battered before frying . See also : chicken fingers and chicken nuggets . Chicken fingers : also known as chicken tenders or chicken strips , this is one of the most common forms of fried chicken , generally pieces of chicken breast ( sometimes with rib meat ) cut into long strips , breaded or battered dipped , and deep fried . Chicken fries : chicken nuggets in the shape of French fries , popularized by the fast-food chains Burger King and KFC . These may also be referred to as chicken sticks . Chicken Maryland , a form of pan-fried chicken , often marinated in buttermilk , served with cream gravy and native to the state of Maryland . The recipe spread beyond the United States to the haute cuisine of Auguste Escoffier and , after heavy modification , found a place in the cuisines of Britain and Australia . The dish is made when a pan of chicken pieces and fat , as for pan frying , is placed in the oven to cook , for a majority of the overall cooking time , basically \" fried in the oven \" . Chicken nuggets : an industrially reconstituted boneless chicken product invented by Cornell poultry science professor Robert C. Baker in the 1950s . Popcorn chicken : occasionally known as chicken bites or other similar terms , small morsels of boneless chicken , battered and fried , resulting in little nuggets that resemble popcorn.Popcorn chicken is also occasionally topped with peanuts , or peanut sauce . Chicken patties : breaded , fried patties of chicken meat used in sandwiches . Country Fried Chicken : chicken meat that has been coated with flour or breaded , fried and served topped with country cream gravy . Related tangentially to Chicken fried steak . Chicken and waffles , a combination platter of foods traditionally served at breakfast and dinner in one meal , common to soul food restaurants in the American South and beyond . Hot chicken : common in the Nashville , Tennessee area , a pan-fried variant of fried chicken coated with lard and cayenne pepper paste .

Salt and pepper chicken : ( \u9e79\u9165\u96de or \u76d0\u9165\u9e21 ) Cubes of chicken leg meat marinated and deep-fried , similar to karaage but flavoured with pepper salt and / or five-spice powder . Originating in Taiwanese night markets , it has also been popularized in North American Taiwanese bubble tea restaurants . Taiwan fried chicken fillet : Chicken fillet prepared in a similar way to salt and pepper chicken , as one large piece eaten in a paper bag . Popular in Taiwanese night markets . Chicken katsu : ( \u30c1\u30ad\u30f3\u30ab\u30c4 ) , a Japanese panko-breaded , deep fried chicken cutlet , adapted from tonkatsu , a pork chop variant . Occasionally used in curry . Korean fried chicken : ( \uc591\ub150 \uce58\ud0a8 ) , fried chicken pieces flavored with Korean ganjang sauce with garlic . Buldak : fried chicken with Korean seasonings like gochujang .

Chicken lollipop : An Indian snack of fried chicken drumettes , coated in a spiced batter and fried . = = Racial stereotype = = In the United States , fried chicken has stereotypically been associated with African-Americans . The reasons for this are various . Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War , as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own . With the prevalence of such a stereotype being due in large part to minstrel shows and the film Birth of a Nation . On two occasions the golfer Tiger Woods has been the target of remarks regarding fried chicken . The first occurred in 1997 when golfer Fuzzy Zoeller said that Woods should avoid choosing fried chicken for the Masters champions ' dinner the following year ; the second when golfer Sergio Garc\u00eda was asked in a press conference in 2013 whether he would invite Woods to dinner during the U.S. Open to settle their ongoing feud . Garc\u00eda said : \" We will have him round every night . . . We will serve fried chicken \" , which Woods said was \" wrong , hurtful and clearly inappropriate \" . Both Zoeller and Garc\u00eda subsequently apologized to Woods . In 2009 , a Bangladeshi immigrant to the U.S. renamed his restaurant \" Obama Fried Chicken \" in honor of recently inaugurated President Barack Obama . Despite controversy at the time , the owner refused to change the name back , and the restaurant continues to operate under this name . At a dinner during Black History Month , an NBC chef , Leslie Calhoun , served fried chicken . The drummer of the Roots , Questlove , was angered by this and thought it both offensive and ignorant . In 2012 , Burger King withdrew a commercial which featured Mary J. Blige singing about a crispy chicken wrap , due to the racial stereotypes surrounding fried chicken .",

                    "text": "Namib Desert Horse = The Namib Desert Horse is a rare feral horse found in the Namib Desert of Namibia , Africa . It is probably the only feral herd of horses residing in Africa , with a population ranging between 90 and 150 . The Namib Desert Horse is athletic in appearance , resembling the European light riding horses from which it probably descends , and usually dark in color . Despite the harsh environment in which they live , the horses are generally in good condition , except during times of extreme drought . The horses have been the subject of several population studies , which have given significant insight into their population dynamics and ability to survive in desert conditions . The origin of the Namib Desert Horse is unclear , though several theories have been put forward . Genetic tests have been performed , although none to date have completely verified their origin . The most likely ancestors of the horses are a mix of riding horses and cavalry horses , many from German breeding programs , released from various farms and camps in the early 20th century , especially during World War I. Whatever their origin , the horses eventually congregated in the Garub Plains , near Aus , Namibia , the location of a man-made water source . They were generally ignored by humans , except for the periodic threat of eradication due to the possibility that they were destroying native herbivore habitat , until the 1980s . In 1984 , the first aerial survey of the population was made , and in 1986 , their traditional grazing land was incorporated into the Namib-Naukluft Park . At several points , some horses have been removed from the herd , including the removal and sale of over one-third of the population in 1992 . Since the early 1990s , close records of the population have been kept , and studies have been performed to determine the horses ' effect on their environment . Despite being considered an exotic species within the park , they are allowed to remain due to their ties to the country 's history and draw as a tourist attraction . = = Characteristics = = The most common color of the Namib Desert Horse is bay , although there are a few chestnut and brown horses . The gene for gray does not occur in the breed . There are many individuals with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes . No other colors have been recorded . The Namib Desert Horses are athletic , muscular , clean-limbed , and strong boned . They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers . The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head , skin , and coat . Overall , they have good conformation , with few deformities . Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals , likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances . Scientists studying the horses rate their body condition on a scale of one ( excellent ) to five ( very poor ) , based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone . The horses tend to remain in above average condition , despite the harsh environment in which they live , with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares . During severe droughts , the average body score decreases , but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition . The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall , through a correlation to available forage , though temperature , distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role . Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites . Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present ( strongyles , small and large pinworms and Ascarids ) , as well as the larvae of botflys . = = = Behavior and ecology = = = The home range of the Namib Desert Horse reaches north in the Namib Desert to the Koichab River , usually dry , and west to the Great Escarpment . Bands of horses range together , consisting of as few as two animals , although there are generally more . In observations between 1993 and 2003 , between six and eleven bands were identified , including a mixture of bachelor herds , breeding groups and co-operating stallion groups ( groups with more than one stallion that share breeding duties ) . The Namib Desert Horse travels extensively , searching for food , water and shelter from the climate and insects . A 1994 study found that they have an average home range of 13 square miles ( 34 km2 ) , although not all of that is traversed each day . They must cover considerable distances , as much as 15 to 20 kilometres ( 9 to 12 mi ) between the few existing water sources and the best grazing sources . This creates severe selection pressure and removes weak animals from the population . Due to scarcity of water , the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water for as long as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter , significantly longer than most horses , even other feral herds . A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water . In 1993 , a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours , but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours , a common occurrence in their feral state . The horses , especially young foals and juveniles , provide a major food source in the southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena , along with gemsbok and springbok . However , the availability of other food appears to have a significant influence on predation rates among the horses . Leopards and black-backed jackals also predate young horses , although this is more rare . The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse , as they cause dehydration , malnutrition , exhaustion and lameness . Other large plains animals , including the mountain zebra , may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall , but human interference ( including fencing off portions of land and hunting ) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area . The endangered Hartmann 's mountain zebra does exist in the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park , but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse . = = = Genetics = = = Genetic testing results published in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses are one of the most isolated horse populations in the world , with the second-lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date . In part , this is due to their small founding population , and generally small modern population , made smaller during periods of drought . Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended , at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed 's history , resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time . Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses , the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall . Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals . The 2001 testing showed the Namib Desert Horse to be part of the Oriental horse grouping , genetically closest to the Arabian horse , although even this association was distant . They were closer to the Arabian than to the three South African breeds tested , the Nooitgedacht pony , the Boer pony and the Basuto pony . As the genetic similarity to Arabian-type horses is distant , they do not closely resemble them in outward appearance , although they are both of the \" hot blooded \" type , resulting in both being athletic , lean-muscled animals . Further , in blood typing studies done in the 1990s , a new variant was noted . Its absence from the blood samples of all other horse breeds indicates the presence of a mutation that probably occurred after the horses became established in the desert . = = History = = Southern Africa has no native horse populations , so the origins of the Namib Desert Horse trace to imported herds of horses . There are several theories on the ancestors of the Namib Desert Horse , and the true story may never be known . One theory says that a cargo ship carrying Thoroughbreds to Australia wrecked near the Orange River , and the strongest horses swam ashore and traveled to the Garub Plains , the home of the Namib Desert Horse , near Aus , Namibia . Another theory states that they descend from Cape horse / Basuto pony crosses ridden by Khoikhoi raiders traveling from southern Africa to north of the Orange River . The most likely theory has the Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of escaped South African military horses and Namibian-bred German horses . During World War I , horses were used in campaigns in Namibia between the German Schutztruppe and South African troops , and some escaped or were released into the desert . Prior to this time , a German Baron von Wolf built Dunwisib Castle on the edge of the Namib Desert , where he held a herd of approximately 300 horses . Von Wolf was killed in action in Europe during World War I , and his farm was abandoned , leaving his horses on unfenced land relatively close to the area where the Namib Desert Horses now roam . The Namib Desert Horse phenotypically more closely resembles the horses bred by von Wolf and ridden by the World War I-era troops than the horses ridden by Khoikhoi tribesmen , making the former story the more likely . The genetic evidence of the 2001 study gave less credence to the descent from von Wolf 's horses . He used Thoroughbreds , Hackneys and Trakehners in his breeding program , rather than the Arabian horse to which the Namib Desert Horses are the most genetically similar . Research in the archives of pre-1914 horse breeding operations found at Windhoek , combined with blood typing studies , suggests that the animals descended from a gene pool of high-quality riding animals , as opposed to work horses . A study released in 2005 reinforces the theory of the Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of European-descended breeding stock and escaped military horses . One possible source of breeding stock was a stud farm near Kubub , leased by Emil Kreplin ( previously mayor of L\u00fcderitz ) from 1911 to 1919 . Photo albums from the stud show animals with conformation and markings similar to those seen in the modern Namib Desert Horse . In addition , in early 1915 , during the fighting of World War I , bombs were dropped by a German aircraft onto the South African camp near Garub . Some ordnance seems to have been specifically targeted to land among a herd of 1,700 grazing horses , for the purposes of scattering them . These escaped army animals may have joined stock animals lost from Kreplin 's stud farm during the turmoil of the war . Horses in the area would likely have congregated at the few existing watering places in the Aus Mountains and Garub . = = = 1970s to present = = = The Namib Desert Horses were originally forced to compete with domesticated livestock turned loose by farmers onto the same ground where the horses grazed . Due in part to this competition for limited forage , the horses nearly became extinct . However , they were saved in part due to the efforts of Jan Coetzer , employee of Consolidated Diamond Mine ( CDM or DBCM ) , mining in part of Sperrgebiet . Garub was a station for the re-filling of steam locomotives until 1977 , when diesel locomotives took over the route . The horses , who had previously survived on water pumped for the locomotives , were placed in danger when the pumping stopped , with several horses dying of dehydration . Coetzer petitioned CDM to supply the horses with water , which they did in 1980 , installing holding tanks and a water trough . Between 1964 and 1984 , population estimates ranged between 50 and 200 horses , but generally averaged 140 to 160 . In 1984 , an aerial count was made that distinguished 168 horses , while ground-based observations in 1988 estimated between 150 and 200 animals . In the mid-1980s , the horses ' habitat was made part of Namib-Naukluft Park , the largest game reserve in Africa . In 1986 , after the expansion to the park , a movement was made to remove all horses ( which were considered an exotic species ) ; public outcry prevented this from happening . The following year , 10 horses were removed from the park for research purposes and 8 others for use as patrol horses in Etosha National Park , although they were unsuccessful in the latter use . In 1992 , as Namibia gained its independence and a drought enveloped southern Africa , a decision was made to reduce the population , then estimated at 276 animals . In June , 104 animals were captured unselectively and sold , but many did not adjust well to their new habitats and by 1997 at least half had died . In 1997 , with the feral population at 149 horses , 35 horses , selected for age , gender and degree of genetic relationship , were removed , with the intent being to sell them at auction . The horses were kept in holding pens for six weeks , during which time the stallions became very aggressive and had to be separated ; after this , the auction was cancelled and the horses released back to their range . Beginning in December 1993 , semiannual population counts have been completed . Between 1993 and 2005 , herd numbers ranged between 89 and 149 animals , with the 1999 \u2013 2001 counts providing sub-100 population numbers . Although several attempts were originally made to exterminate the horses , due to a possible threat to oryx habitat , they are now protected by the South West Africa / Namibia Directorate of Nature Conservation . The Namib Desert Horse is likely the only herd of feral horses in Africa . There is concern in some quarters that the horses are a negative influence on their habitat , through overgrazing and competition with native species . While exotic species , such as the Namib Desert Horse , are generally unwanted in the Namib-Naukluft Park , the horses are a special case , given their close ties with Namibian history , their popularity with visitors , and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands . Studies during 2003 and 2004 , however , found that while an area of approximately 100 metres ( 330 ft ) around the watering area at Garub has been affected by the horses , there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius . The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses , probably due to the low population density and natural rotational grazing . Due to the lack of affect on vegetation by horses , it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations . The horses also appear to have no measurable affect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species , which in several cases are more threatened by human influence . As the horses are restricted to a certain grazing area and native large herbivores are not , the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species . The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as \" ghost horses \" , as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen . However , when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve , a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary , bringing the horses into closer contact with humans . This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia , who frequently see them at the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds . While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia , there are also concerns about negative horse-human interactions , including vehicle accidents , disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans .",

                    "text": "Acer pseudoplatanus = Acer pseudoplatanus , known as the sycamore in the United Kingdom and the sycamore maple in the United States , is a flowering plant species in the soapberry and lychee family Sapindaceae . It is a large deciduous , broad-leaved tree , tolerant of wind and coastal exposure . It is native to Central Europe and Western Asia , from France eastwards to Ukraine , northern Turkey and the Caucasus and southwards in the mountains of northern Spain and Italy . The sycamore establishes itself easily from seed and was introduced to the British Isles by 1500 , and is now naturalised there and in other parts of Europe , North America , Australia and New Zealand where it may become an invasive species . The sycamore can grow to a height of about 35 m ( 115 ft ) and the branches form a broad , rounded crown . The bark is grey , smooth when young and later flaking in irregular patches . The leaves grow on long leafstalks and are large and palmate , with 5 large radiating lobes . The flowers are greenish-yellow and hang in dangling flowerheads called panicles . They produce copious amounts of pollen and nectar that are attractive to insects . The winged seeds or samaras are borne in pairs and twirl to the ground when ripe . They germinate freely in the following spring . In its native range , the sycamore is associated with a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi , but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced . It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing , creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments , furniture , joinery , wood flooring and kitchen utensils . It also makes good firewood . The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar . = = Taxonomy and etymology = = Acer pseudoplatanus was first described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum in 1753 . It is the type species in the maple genus Acer . Many forms and varieties have been proposed , including natural varieties such as var. macrocarpum Spach , var. microcarpum Spach , and var. tomentosum Tausch , and forms such as f. erythrocarpum ( Carri\u00e8re ) Pax , f. purpureum ( Loudon ) Rehder , and f. variegatum ( Weston ) Rehder . These are all now considered to be synonyms of Acer pseudoplatanus L. The specific name pseudoplatanus refers to the superficial similarity of the leaves and bark of the sycamore to those of plane trees in the genus Platanus , the prefix pseudo- ( from Ancient Greek ) meaning \" false \" . However , the two genera are in different families that are only distantly related . Acer and Platanus differ in the position in which leaves are attached to the stem ( alternate in Platanus , paired or opposite in Acer ) and in their fruit , which are spherical clusters in Platanus and paired samaras ( winged fruit ) in Acer . The common name \" sycamore \" originally applied to the fig species Ficus sycomorus , the sycamore or sycomore referred to in the Bible , that is native to southwest Asia . Other common names for the tree include false plane-tree , great maple , Scottish maple , mount maple , mock-plane , or Celtic maple . = = Description = = The sycamore is a large , broadleaved deciduous tree that reaches 20 \u2013 35 m ( 66 \u2013 115 ft ) tall at maturity , the branches forming a broad , domed crown . The bark of young trees is smooth and grey but becomes rougher with age and breaks up into scales , exposing the pale-brown-to-pinkish inner bark . The buds are produced in opposite pairs , ovoid ( approximately oval in shape ) and pointed , with the bud scales ( the modified leaves that enclose and protect the bud ) green , edged in dark brown and with dark brown tips , 0.5 \u2013 1 cm ( 0.2-0.4 in ) . When the leaves are shed they leave horseshoe shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem . The leaves are opposite , large , 10 to 25 cm ( 4 to 10 in ) long and broad , palmate with 5 pointed lobes that are coarsely toothed or serrated . They have a leathery texture with thick veins protruding on the underside . They are dark green in colour with a paler underside . Some cultivars have purple-tinged or yellowish leaves . The leaf stalk or petiole is 5 to 15 cm ( 2 to 6 in ) long , is often tinged red with no stipules or leaf-like structures at the base . The monoecious ( or bisexual ) yellow-green flowers are produced after the leaves in early summer , in May or June in the British Isles , on pendulous panicles 10 to 20 cm ( 4 to 8 in ) long with about 60 \u2013 100 flowers on each stalk . The fruits are paired winged seeds or samaras , the seeds 5 to 10 mm ( 0.2 to 0.4 in ) in diameter , each with a wing 20 to 40 mm ( 0.8 to 1.6 in ) long developed as an extension of the ovary wall . The wings are held at about right angles to each other , distinguishing them from those of A. platanoides and A. campestre , in which the wings are almost opposite , and from those of A. saccharum , in which they are almost parallel . When shed , the wing of the samara catches the wind and rotates the fruit as it falls , slowing its descent and enabling the wind to disperse it further from the parent tree . The seeds are mature in autumn about four months after pollination . The sycamore is tetraploid ( each cell having four sets of chromosomes , 2n = 52 ) , whereas A. campestre and A. platanoides are diploid ( with 2 sets of chromosomes , 2n = 26 ) . = = Botany = = Sycamore trees produce their flowers in hanging branched clusters known as panicles that contain a variety of different flower types . Most are morphologically bisexual , with both male and female organs , but function as if they were unisexual . Some are both morphologically and functionally male , others morphologically bisexual but function as males , and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females . All of the flower types can produce pollen , but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate . All flowers produce nectar , the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content . Sycamore trees are very variable across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination , which is undesirable because it limits the genetic variation of the progeny and may depress their vigour . Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers . On any one tree , one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later . Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another . The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates in different parts of the crown , and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks , so that cross-pollination is encouraged , although self-pollination may not be completely prevented . The sycamore may hybridise with other species in Acer section Acer , including with A. heldreichii where their natural ranges overlap and with A.velutinum. Intersectional hybrids with A. griseum ( Acer section Trifoliata ) are also known , in which the basal lobes of the leaf are reduced in size , making the leaves appear almost three-lobed ( trifoliate ) . = = Distribution = = The sycamore is native to central and eastern Europe and western Asia . Its natural range includes Albania , Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Georgia , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Lithuania , Poland , Romania , southern Russia , Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia . Reports of it occurring in eastern Turkey have been found to refer to A. heldreichii subsp. trautvetteri . It was probably introduced into Britain in the Tudor period by 1500 and was first recorded in the wild in 1632 in Kent . The date of its first introduction into Ireland is unclear , but the oldest specimen in Ireland is in County Cavan and dates from the seventeenth century . It was introduced into Sweden around 1770 with seeds obtained from Holland . The lack of old native names for it has been used to demonstrate its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487 , but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree , fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least as far back as the Gaelic settlement at D\u00e1l Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries . This would make it either an archaeophyte ( a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500 ) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention . At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte , a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500 . Today , the sycamore is present in 3,461 ( 89.7 % ) of hectads in Britain , more than any native tree species . The sycamore has been introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park , street or garden . These include the United States , Canada , Australia ( Victoria and Tasmania ) , Chile and New Zealand , Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores . At the time of its introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species . The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia ( Yarra Ranges , Victoria ) and also Mount Macedon , near Daylesford , parts of the Dandenong Ranges and Tasmania , where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests . It is also considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand , Norway , and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom . In about 1870 , the sycamore was introduced into the United States , and was planted in New York and New Jersey . It was later cultivated as a park or street tree in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states . By the early part of the 21st century , it was naturalised in fourteen states ( Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Kentucky , Maine , Michigan , North Carolina , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island and Washington , D.C. ) , and in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia and Ontario . The United States Department of Agriculture considers it an invasive species . = = Ecology = = In its native range , the sycamore is a natural component of birch ( Betula sp . ) , beech ( Fagus sp . ) and fir ( Abies sp . ) forests . It readily invades disturbed habitats such as forest plantations , abandoned farmland and brownfield land , railway lines and roadsides verges , hedgerows , native and semi-natural woodland and , in New Zealand , high country tussock grassland . As an introduced , invasive species it may degrade the laurel forest in Madeira and Portugal and is a potential threat to the rare endemic Madeiran orchid , Dactylorhiza foliosa . It is tolerant of a wide range of soil types and pH , except heavy clay and is at its best on nutrient-rich slightly calcareous soils . The roots of the sycamore form highly specific beneficial mycorrhizal associations with the fungus Glomus hoi which promotes phosphorus uptake from the soil . Sycamore mycorrhizas are of the internal arbuscular mycorrhizal type , in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched , tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex . The larvae of a number of species of moth use the leaves as a food source . These include the sycamore moth ( Acronicta aceris ) , the maple prominent ( Ptilodon cucullina ) and the plumed prominent ( Ptilophora plumigera ) . The horse-chestnut leaf miner ( Cameraria ohridella ) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore , although 70 % of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar . The leaves attract aphids , and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them . The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects , and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds . As an introduced plant , in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species , but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple . The tree may also be attacked by the horse chestnut scale insect ( Pulvinaria regalis ) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches , but does not cause serious damage to the tree . Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches , girdling the stem ; as a result whole branches may die , leaving brown , wilted leaves . The sycamore gall mite Eriophyes macrorhynchus produces small red galls , similar to those of the nail gall mite Eriophyes tiliae , on leaves of sycamore and field maple , Acer campestris from April onwards . Another mite , Aceria pseudoplatani causes a ' sycamore felt gall ' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple ( Acer platanoides ) . The sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis sucks sap from buds and foliage , producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage , cars and garden furniture beneath . The sycamore is susceptible to sooty bark disease , caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale . This causes wilting of the crown and the death of branches . Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores . The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years , working its way towards the bark following long , hot summers . The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper \u2019 s disease , a hypersensitivity pneumonitis . Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot , in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage . The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected . Sycamore leaf spot , caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans , results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall . This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run . = = Cultivation = = Sycamore self-seeds very vigorously , the seeds germinating en masse in the spring so that there is little , or no , seed bank in the soil . It is readily propagated from seed in cultivation , but varieties cannot be relied on to breed true . Special cultivars such A. pseudoplatanus ' Brilliantissimum ' may be propagated by grafting . This variety is notable for the bright salmon-pink colour of the young foliage and is the only sycamore cultivar to have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit . A rare weeping form with dangling branches , A. pseudoplatanus var. pendulum , was first sold by Knight & Perry 's exotic nursery in Chelsea , England before 1850 when the name was published by W.H. Baxter in the Supplement to Loudon 's Hortus Brittanicus , but no specimens of this cultivar are known to survive . The sycamore is noted for its tolerance of wind , urban pollution , salt spray , and low summer temperatures , which makes it a popular tree for planting in cities , along roads treated with salt in winter , and in coastal localities . It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe , notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Troms\u00f8 , Norway ( seeds can ripen as far north as Vester\u00e5len ) ; Reykjav\u00edk , Iceland ; and T\u00f3rshavn on the Faroe Islands . It now occurs throughout the British Isles , having been introduced in the 16th century . Sycamores make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can therefore be coppiced to produce poles and other types of small timber . Its coppice stools grow comparatively rapidly , reaching up to 10 feet in diameter in 450 years . It is grown as a species for medium to large bonsai in many areas of Europe where some fine specimens can be found . = = Uses = = Sycamore is planted in parks for ornamental purposes , and sometimes as a street tree , since its tolerance of air pollution makes it suitable for use in urban plantings . Because of its tolerance to wind , it has often been planted in coastal and exposed areas as a windbreak . It produces a hard-wearing , white or cream close-grained timber that turns golden with age . The wood can be worked and sawn in any direction and is used for making musical instruments , furniture , joinery , wood flooring and parquetry . Because it is non-staining , is used for kitchen utensils , wooden spoons , bowls , rolling pins and chopping boards . In Scotland it has traditionally been used for making fine boxes , sometimes in association with contrasting , dark-coloured laburnum wood . The reference to the \" white maple \" in the English Christmas carol , \" Wassail , Wassail All Over the Town \" , in \" Our bowl , it is made of the white maple tree \" presumably refers not to the silver or white maple ( A. saccharinum ) , which does not occur naturally in Europe , but to the white wood of the sycamore or the field maple , Acer campestre . Occasionally , trees produce wood with a wavy grain , greatly increasing the value for decorative veneers . The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood , weighing 630 kg per cubic metre . It is a traditional wood for use in making the backs , necks and scrolls of violins . The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore . Whistles can be made from straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated , and these , and sycamore branches , are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall . The wood is used for fuel , being easy to saw and to split with an axe , producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt . In Scotland , sycamores were once a favoured tree for hangings , because their lower branches rarely broke under the strain . Both male and female flowers produce abundant nectar , which makes a fragrant , delicately flavoured and pale-coloured honey . The nectar and copious dull yellow ochre pollen are collected by honeybees as food sources . The sap rises vigorously in the spring and like that of sugar maple can be tapped to provide a refreshing drink , as a source of sugar and to make beer . = = Notable specimens = = = = = The Tolpuddle Martyrs ' Tree = = = Under this sycamore tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset , England , six agricultural labourers , known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs , formed an early trades union in 1834 . They were found to have breached the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 and were transported to Australia . The subsequent public outcry led to their release and return . The tree now has a girth of 5.9 metres ( 19 feet , 4 inches ) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680 . The tree is cared for by the National Trust , who have pollarded the tree in 2002 and 2014 . = = = The Corstorphine Sycamore Tree = = = An ancient sycamore ( sometimes described as a \" plane \" ) with distinctive yellow foliage formerly stood in the village of Corstorphine , now a suburb of Edinburgh , Scotland . The tree was reputedly planted in the 15th century and is named as the form Acer pseudoplatanus f. corstorphinense Schwer . Not only was it claimed to be the \" largest sycamore in Scotland \" but also the scene of James Lord Forrester 's murder in 1679 . The tree was blown down in a storm on Boxing Day 1998 , but a replacement , grown from a cutting , now stands in the churchyard of Corstorphine Kirk . The tree is commemorated in the badge of the Corstorphine Bowling Club of Edinburgh , designed in 1950 to feature the Corstorphine sycamore tree and a single horn , and redesigned in 1991 for the club \u2019 s centenary . = = = The Newbattle Abbey sycamore = = = The Newbattle Abbey sycamore near Dalkeith , planted in 1550 , was the specimen with the earliest known planting date in Scotland . It had achieved a girth of 5 m ( 16 ft ) and a height of 26 m ( 85 ft ) by the time it was toppled by a gale in May 2006 at the age of 456 years . = = = The Money Tree = = = Saint Fintan founded a monastery at Clonenagh , Ireland , in the sixth century and it had a spring beside it . This was considered holy and was visited by pilgrims . In the nineteenth century , a Protestant land owner , annoyed at people visiting the site , filled the well in , whereupon the water started to flow into the hollow interior of a sycamore tree on the other side of the road . Filled with amazement , people hung rags on the tree and pressed coins into its trunk as votive offerings and it became known as the \" Money Tree \" . Some years later , it fell down , but new shoots appeared from its base , and the water still welled up . It remains a place of veneration on St Fintan 's day , February 17 .",

                    "text": "Saluki = The Saluki or Persian Greyhound is a dog breed originating in the Fertile Crescent and Persia . The Saluki is classed as a sighthound and is typically deep-chested and long-legged . Salukis tend to be independent animals requiring patient training and are gentle and affectionate with their owners . = = Name = = The two ancient Sumerian words \" Salu-ki \" translate into \" plunge-earth . \" However there is no evidence the breed was referred to by the Sumerians with this name nor what \" plunge to earth \" might have meant in reference to the Saluki . The name of the breed first appeared in writing in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry and may have derived from \" Saluqiyyah , \" the Arabic form of Seleucia . However , this is disputed . British diplomat Sir Terence Clark wrote that the Arabic word \" Saluqi \" describes a person or thing from a place named Saluq . Arab tradition states that Saluq was an ancient town in Yemen not far from modern Ta 'izz , and the Arabs associate this town with the origin of the breed . However , the word \" saluqi \" might have been derived from reference to several other places : Saluq in Armenia , and three towns called Saluqiyah . One has become modern Silifke ( Turkey ) , another is near Antioch ( modern Antakya , Turkey ) and third is located near Baghdad ( Iraq ) . The latter was the capital of the Seleucid Empire ( 312 BC - 65 AD ) and the adjective saluqi may have been derived by the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula from the similar sounding word for Seleucid used in the Aramaic and Syriac languages spoken there by the various peoples of that part of Mesopotamia , but there is no irrefutable evidence . = = Description = = Salukis are \" sight \" hounds \u2014 hunting by sight \u2014 and run their quarry down to kill or retrieve it . The normal size range for the breed is 23 \u2013 28 inches ( 58 \u2013 71 cm ) high at the withers and 40 \u2013 60 pounds ( 18 \u2013 27 kg ) in weight . Females Salukis are slightly smaller than males . The head is long and narrow with large eyes and drop ears . The tail of the breed is long and curved . It has the typical deep-chested , long-legged body of sighthounds . The coat comes in a variety of colors including white , cream , fawn , red , grizzle / tan , black / tan , and tri-color ( white , black and tan ) . The overall appearance of the Saluki is one of grace and symmetry . Two coat types \u2014 smooth and feathered \u2014 are evident in the breed 's gene pool . The latter variety has light feathering on the back of the legs and thighs . The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding when compared to other breeds . = = Swiftness and physical capacity = = While the Greyhound is credited as being the fastest dog breed up to distances of around 800 metres ( 2,600 ft ) , both the Saluki and Whippet breeds are thought to be faster over longer distances . In 1996 , The Guinness Book of Records listed a Saluki as being the fastest dog , capable of reaching a speed of 68.8 kilometres ( 42.8 mi ) per hour . Due to its heavily padded feet being able to absorb the impact on its body , the Saluki has remarkable stamina when running . Historically , Salukis were used for hunting by nomadic tribes . Typical quarry included the gazelle , hare , fox and jackal . While hunting hares , Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki , which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start . Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out the eyes of the prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal . = = Temperament = = The modern Saluki has retained qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers . The often independent and aloof breed may be difficult to train . Training methods should always be gentle and patient . Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods . The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls . Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life . Given its hunting instincts , the dog is prone to chasing moving objects . = = Health = = Hip dysplasia is uncommon in Salukis , with the breed ranking joint lowest in a survey by the British Veterinary Association in 2003 . The breed scored an average of 5 points , with a score of 0 being low , while 106 is high . In a 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee , responses highlighted several health issues . The primary cause of death identified was that of cancer , being responsible for 35.6 % of deaths , with the most common forms being that of liver cancer or lymphoma . The secondary cause of death was cardiac related , with forms such as heart failure , or unspecified heart defects . Old age is listed as the third most frequent cause of death . Cardiomyopathy , heart murmur and other cardiac issues were present in 17.2 % of responses while dermatolic conditions such as dermatitis or alopecia were reported by 10.8 % of responses . Salukis have an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years , which is similar to other breeds of their size . = = History = = The Saluki are one of the earliest dog breeds , splitting off ( together with the related Afghan Hound ) from the rest of dog breeds in the fourth major genetic split . The Saluki was historically bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated . Images of running dogs with long , narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa that dates back to 6,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia , with one writer suggesting that these might depict the ancestor of the saluki , despite the depictions bearing erect , pointed ears . Salukis and greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the The Middle Kingdom ( 2134 BC \u2013 1785 BC ) onward , however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence , replacing the Tesem ( thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs or a generic term for a dog ) in ancient Egyptian art . The breed spread southward into the Sudan . From Iran , the breed is mentioned in the poetry of Khaghani ( 1121-1190 ) , depicted in miniature paintings of hunting scenes along with horseback archers by Master Kam\u0101l ud-D\u012bn Behz\u0101d ( 1450 \u2013 1535 ) , depicted in book illustrations by ' Abd al-Wahhab ibn ' Abd al-Fattah ibn ' Ali ( 1516 ) , and in metal-smithing from the reign of the Injuid prince , Jamal al Dine Abu Is 'haq , created between 1342 \u2013 1353 . One of the more outstanding pieces of sculpture in Iran is the Savashi Canyon Relief , carved around 1800 , that was commissioned by Shar Fath-Ali Shah Qajar to commemorate his hunting exploits . The Silk Road was a trading route that stretched from ancient Iran to China . From China , examples of the breed were painted by the fifth Ming Emperor Zh\u016b Zh\u0101nj\u012b , known more commonly as the Xuande Emperor during the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 \u2013 1644 ) . The inscription on the painting reads \" playfully painted [ by the ] imperial brush \" in 1427 . Additional red seals were added in later years by owners of the painting , which also reveals that the painting was in the Imperial Chinese collection in the 18th century . From Europe , the legend maintains that the returning crusaders brought the Saluki back from the Middle East . The painting of Henry IV , Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog , painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514 , is thought by some to be a Saluki . The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell , which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain . Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese 's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi ( also known as the Adoration of the Kings ) , currently located at the National Gallery , London . Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings : the The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses . Sheik Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa , King of Bahrain during the 1930s , was known for a pack of Salukis that accompanied him throughout the Arab world on hunting trips . Following his death , his son Salman ibn Hamad Al Khalifa attempted to keep the lines pure-bred but they became interbred with other breeds . However , the pure-bred lines of the royal kennel were saved by the efforts of Dana Al Khalifa who was given two pure-bred puppies by the King , and about a decade later had pure-bred Salukis registered with the Kennel Club of Bahrain . Today , the breed is still held in high regard throughout the Middle East and were hunting dogs for nobles and rulers around the region . They are considered clean by the Bedouins , and are allowed to be in women 's quarters , while other dogs must be kept outside . In 2014 , a DNA study compared dogs and wolves for AMY2B ( Alpha-Amylase 2B ) , which is a gene that codes a protein that assists with the first step in the digestion of dietary starch and glycogen . An expansion of this gene in dogs would enable early dogs to exploit a starch-rich diet as they fed on refuse from agriculture . Data indicated that the wolves and dingo had just 2 copies of the gene , the Siberian Husky that is associated with hunter-gatherers had just 3 \u2013 4 copies , \" whereas the Saluki , which was historically bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated , has 29 copies \" . = = = Breeding in the West = = = It was not until 1840 , that the Salukis were first brought to England . Referred to as Slughis , they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed , however recent genetic tests have shown that the two breeds are genetically separate . The first successful modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895 , with Florence Amherst ( daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney ) . Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year , she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt . A champion of breed purity , she struggled alone for nearly three decades , and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s , when officers returning from the war in the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them . One of these was Brigadier General Frederick Lance of the 19th Lancers , and his wife , Gladys , returned to Britain with two Salukis from Sarona , where he was stationed during the post-war occupation . The Lances were both keen hunters , and rode with their pack of dogs , including both Salukis and terriers , to course jackal and Dorcas Gazelle whilst stationed in the desert . They imported a male , called Sarona Kelb , who became an influence on the breed in the West . Together , the Lances and Florence Amherst mounted a campaign for recognition of the Middle Eastern breed , that coincided with the phenomenon of \" Tutmania \" caused by Howard Carter 's discovery of Tutankhamun 's tomb in late 1922 . In 1923 , the Saluki or Gazelle Hound Club was formed , and the Kennel Club granted official recognition to the breed . The first registered Salukis in the western studbook were Cyrus and Slongha Peri imported from Iran and registered with the DWZRV . DWZRV also records the first litter in 1922 . Imports to England during the inter-war years were chiefly from areas of British military influence and commerce : Bahrain , Egypt , Transjordan , and Iraq . Both Florence Amherst and the Lances imported breeding stock from the latter two countries . Despite substantial populations of Salukis in Germany , the Netherlands , and Sweden , none of these were imported to England . English Salukis ( chiefly descendants of Sarona Kelb ) were exported to many countries , but by the mid-1930s , interest slackened , and with the outbreak of World War II , breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped . The number of litters was minimal \u2013 just enough to keep the breed alive . Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans , and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs , some owners euthanized entire kennels . A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war , and along with fresh imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East , the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again . Popularity of Salukis dramatically increased , and the Saluki Club of America was founded in 1927 , Salukis were recognized by The Kennel Club in 1923 , and by the American Kennel Club in 1929 . The breed is also the mascot of Southern Illinois University Carbondale . The popularity of the Saluki in the United States , according to the American Kennel Club , has remained relatively stable over the past decade , with the breed ranked 107th in 1999 , had decreased to 118th in 2008 , but by 2008 had increased once again to 112th . Between 2000 and 2009 , 1215 Salukis were registered with The Kennel Club in the UK , while this does not approach the numbers of the more popular breeds , it is in line with similar breeds in the Hound Group such as the Borzoi , which had 1399 puppies registered in the same period . In September 2007 , The Kennel Club Art Gallery 's 12th exhibition celebrated the Saluki , The Saluki in Art showed a range of exhibits including terracotta and bronze works , along with contemporary artists and a range of trophies from Saluki breed clubs .",

                    "text": "Zinfandel = Zinfandel ( also known as Primitivo ) is a variety of black-skinned wine grape . The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards . DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski and Tribidrag , as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia ( the \" heel \" of Italy ) , where it was introduced in the 18th century . The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century , where it became known by variations of the name \" Zinfandel \" , a name which is probably of Austrian origin . The grapes typically produce a robust red wine , although in the United States a semi-sweet ros\u00e9 ( blush-style ) wine called White Zinfandel has six times as many sales as the red wine . The grape 's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent . The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made . Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas , whereas blackberry , anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone . = = History = = = = = Europe ( 6000 BCE \u2013 1870 ) = = = Archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of Vitis vinifera occurred in the Caucasus region around 6000 BCE , and winemaking was discovered shortly after that . Cultivation of the vine subsequently spread to the Mediterranean and surrounding regions . Croatia once had several indigenous varieties related to Zinfandel , which formed the basis of its wine industry in the 19th century . This diversity suggests that the grapes have been grown in Croatia longer than anywhere else . However , these varieties were almost entirely wiped out by the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century , eventually reducing Zinfandel to just nine vines of locally-known \" Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski \" discovered in 2001 on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia . The first documented use of the term Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s . The name derives from the terms primativus or primaticcio , which refer to the grape 's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties . This name 's appearance , 40 years after the first documented use of the term Zinfandel , was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic ; however , this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine 's Croatian origin . Primitivo is now thought to have been introduced as a distinct clone into the Apulia region of Italy in the 18th century . Don Francesco Filippo Indellicati , the priest of the church at Gioia del Colle near Bari , selected an early ( \" primo \" ) ripening plant of the Zagarese variety and planted it in Liponti . This clone ripened at the end of August and became widespread throughout northern Apulia . Cuttings came to the other great Primitivo DOC ( denominazione di origine controllata or \" denomination of controlled origin \" ) as part of the dowry of the Countess Sabini of Altamura when she married Don Tommaso Schiavoni-Tafuri of Manduria in the late 19th century . = = = United States east coast ( 1829 \u2013 1850 ) = = = The arrival of Zinfandel in the United States may have been via the Imperial Nursery in Vienna , Austria , which probably obtained the vines during the Habsburg Monarchy 's rule over Croatia , which was expanded when Austria acquired the Dalmatian territories of the former Republic of Venice in 1797 . George Gibbs , a horticulturist on Long Island , received shipments of grapes from Sch\u00f6nbrunn and elsewhere in Europe between 1820 and 1829 . Sullivan suggests that the \" Black Zinfardel of Hungary \" mentioned by William Robert Prince in A Treatise on the Vine ( 1830 ) may have referred to one of Gibbs 's 1829 acquisitions . Webster suggests that the name is a modification of the Hungarian tzinif\u00e1ndli ( czirifandli ) , which derives from the German Zierfandler , a white grape ( Gruener Sylvaner ) from Austria 's Thermenregion . Gibbs visited Boston in 1830 , and Samuel Perkins of that city began selling \" Zenfendal \" soon afterward . In 1830 , Gibbs also supplied Prince with \" Black St. Peters \" , a similar variety that may have come from England , where many vines have \" St. Peters \" in their names . Little is known about this vine , except that the Black St. Peters that arrived in California in the 1850s was the same as what became known as Zinfandel by the 1870s . By 1835 Charles M. Hovey , Boston \u2019 s leading nurseryman , was recommending \" Zinfindal \" as a table grape , and it was soon widely grown in heated greenhouses for the production of table grapes as early as June . The first reference to making wine from \" Zinfindal \" appears in John Fisk Allen 's Practical Treatise in the Culture and Treatment of the Grape Vine ( 1847 ) . Meanwhile , the fad of hothouse cultivation faded in the 1850s as attention turned to the Concord and other grape varieties that could be grown outdoors in Boston . = = = California ( 1850 \u2013 1933 ) = = = Prince and other nurserymen such as Frederick W. Macondray joined the California Gold Rush in the 1850s , and took Zinfandel with them . Prince 's notebook records that the grape dried \" perfectly to Raisin \" and that he believed his Zinfandel was the same as the \" Black Sonora \" he found in California . When the vine known as \" Black St. Peters \" arrived in California , it was initially regarded as a distinct variety , but by the 1870s it was recognized as the same grape as Zinfandel . Joseph W. Osborne may have made the first wine from Zinfandel in California . He planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll vineyard just north of Napa , and his wine was much praised in 1857 . Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after , and by the end of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California . These Zinfandel old vines are now treasured for the production of premium red wine , but many were ripped up in the 1920s , during the Prohibition years ( 1920 \u2013 1933 ) , but not for the obvious reason . Even during the Prohibition , home winemaking remained effectively legal , and some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home . While Zinfandel grapes proved popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards , it was vulnerable to rot on the long journey to East Coast markets . The thick-skinned Alicante Bouschet was less susceptible to rot , so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home winemaking market . 3000 cars \u2013 about 38,000 short tons ( 34,000 t ) \u2013 of Zinfandel grapes were shipped in 1931 , compared to 6000 cars of Alicante Bouschet . = = = Rediscovery after Prohibition ( 1933 \u2013 present ) = = = By 1930 , the wine industry had weakened due to the Great Depression and Prohibition . Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California 's Central Valley , a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel . Thus , the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes , and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines . However , some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines . By the middle of the 20th century the origins of California Zinfandel had been forgotten . In 1972 , one British wine writer wrote , \" there is a fascinating Californian grape , the zinfandel , said to have come from Hungary , but apparently a c\u00e9page now unknown there . \" In 1974 and 1981 , American wine writers described it as \" a California original , grown nowhere else \" and \" California 's own red grape \" . In 1972 , Bob Trinchero of the Sutter Home Winery decided to try draining some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel . He vinified this juice as a dry wine , and tried to sell it under the name of Oeil de Perdrix , a Swiss wine made by this saign\u00e9e method . The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms insisted on an English translation , so he added \" White Zinfandel \" to the name , and sold 220 cases . At the time , demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes , encouraging other California producers to make \" white \" wine from red grapes , with minimal skin contact . However , in 1975 , Trinchero 's wine experienced a stuck fermentation , a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol . He put the wine aside for two weeks , then tasted it and decided to sell this pinker , sugary wine . Just as Mateus Ros\u00e9 had become a huge success in Europe after World War II , this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular . White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9 % of U.S. wine sales by volume ( 6.3 % by value ) , six times the sales of red Zinfandel . Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California 's Central Valley . Wine critics considered white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s , although modern white Zinfandels have more fruit and less cloying sweetness . Nevertheless , the success of this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas , which came into their own at the end of the 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion . Although the two wines taste dramatically different , both are made from the same ( red ) grapes , processed in a different way . = = Relationship to Primitivo , Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski and Tribidrag = = Zinfandel was long considered \" America 's vine and wine \" , but when University of California , Davis ( UCD ) professor Austin Goheen visited Italy in 1967 , he noticed how wine made from Primitivo reminded him of Zinfandel . Others also made the connection about that time . Primitivo was brought to California in 1968 , and ampelographers declared it identical to Zinfandel in 1972 . The first wine made from these California vines in 1975 also seemed identical to Zinfandel . In 1975 , PhD student Wade Wolfe showed that the two varieties had identical isozyme fingerprints . Dr. Lamberti of Bari had suggested to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo might be the Croatian variety Plavac Mali . By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical , probably by isozyme analysis . Some Croatians , however , became convinced that Plavac Mali was the same as Zinfandel , among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich . In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers ( ZAP ) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine , and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel . With this support , UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia , in collaboration with the University of Zagreb . In 1993 , Meredith used a DNA fingerprinting technique to confirm that Primitivo and Zinfandel are clones of the same variety . Comparative field trials have found that \" Primitivo selections were generally superior to those of Zinfandel , having earlier fruit maturity , similar or higher yield , and similar or lower bunch rot susceptibility . \" This is consistent with the theory that Primitivo was selected as an early-ripening clone of a Croatian grape . By 1998 , Meredith 's team realized that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel but rather that one was the parent of the other . In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo / Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali . The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Peji\u0107 and Edi Maleti\u0107 ( University of Zagreb ) to be Dobri\u010di\u0107 , an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of \u0160olta . This discovery narrowed down the search to the central Dalmatian coastal strip and its offshore islands . Eventually a matching DNA fingerprint was found among the samples . The match came from a vine sampled in 2001 in the vineyard of Ivica Raduni\u0107 in Ka\u0161tel Novi . This Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski ( \" Ka\u0161tela Red \" ) appears to represent Primitivo / Zinfandel in its original home , although some genetic divergence may have occurred since their separation . Meredith now refers to the variety as \" ZPC \" \u2013 Zinfandel / Primitivo / Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski . This Croatian vineyard contained just nine Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski vines mixed with thousands of other vines . In 2002 , additional vines known locally as Pribidrag were found in the Dalmatian coastal town of Omi\u0161 . Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards , although virus infections have delayed their release . The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maleti\u0107 in 2005 . Meanwhile , plantings of Primitivo have increased in California , where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling . Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors . In the 2012 book Wine Grapes Masters of wine Jancis Robinson and Julia Harding and Swiss grape geneticist Dr. Jos\u00e9 Vouillamoz detail the search for Zinfandel 's origins . After years of research and DNA testing of vines from vineyards across the globe , a single 90-year-old grape vine from the garden of an elderly lady in Split , Croatia , provided the evidence to show that Zinfandel was a Croatian grape that has been known as Tribidrag since at least the 15th century . = = = Legal issues = = = Local wine-labeling regulations are slowly catching up with the DNA evidence , a process that has been slowed by trade disputes . The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999 , meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws . Italian winemakers have taken advantage of these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels , with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ( TTB ) . As of December 2007 , the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as approved grape varieties for American wines , but they are not listed as synonyms . U.S. producers , therefore , must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo . The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms , but no decision on this proposal ( RIN 1513 \u2013 AA32 , formerly RIN 1512-AC65 ) has been made . = = Distribution and wines = = = = = United States = = = Zinfandel is grown across the continental United States , although California grows the largest proportion . U.S. producers make wine in styles that range from late harvest dessert wines , ros\u00e9s ( White Zinfandel ) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine in the style of port . The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate , location , and age of the vineyard in which they are grown , as well as the technology employed by the winemaker . Historically , California Zinfandel vines were planted as a field blend interspersed with Durif ( Petite Sirah ) , Carignan , Grenache , Mourv\u00e8dre , Mission and Muscat . While most vineyards are now fully segregated , California winemakers continue to use other grapes ( particularly Petite Sirah ) in their Zinfandel wines . Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11 % of California 's vineyard land area . Around 400,000 short tons ( 350,000 tonnes ) are crushed each year , depending on the harvest , placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot . = = = = California regions = = = = In California , 20 % of the Zinfandel-growing counties hold 80 % of the Zinfandel growing area ; however , major producing areas such as San Joaquin County , Stanislaus County , and Madera County produce Zinfandel primarily for blends or jug wine . Certain California regions are regarded as \" exceptional \" for Zinfandel , each with identifiable flavor characteristics : Amador has a reputation for big , full-bodied Zinfandel . These extra-ripe wines have been called jammy , briary , and brambly , having aromas of sweet berries . Although the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA in Santa Clara Valley produces Zinfandel from just 9 acres ( 3.6 ha ) , the Zinfandel from that region is known for its complexity and depth . Sonoma county has a Zinfandel-producing land area second only to that of San Joaquin County . The county contains the warm Dry Creek Valley AVA , known for its juicy Zinfandel with bright fruit , balanced acidity and notes of blackberry , anise and pepper . Dry Creek Valley produces Zinfandel in a variety of styles ranging from the high-alcohol Amador style to balanced , spicy wines . San Luis Obispo , particularly the Paso Robles AVA with its hot days and cool maritime evenings , produces Zinfandel known for being soft and round . While the Napa Valley AVA is known primarily for its Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot , and Syrah , Napa also produces Zinfandel wines described as plummy and intense , tasting of red berry fruits with cedar and vanilla . Zinfandel in Napa tends to be made in a claret style like red Bordeaux . The Russian River Valley generally produces well during warm vintages . Otherwise , the grapes do not fully ripen , leaving the wines with excessive acidity . The area has mostly \" old vine \" Zinfandel , characterized as spicy and somewhat lower in alcohol than Zinfandel from other regions . Mendocino County Zinfandel wines have been considered high quality , but they are less known because they are not heavily marketed . Lodi has some of the oldest Zinfandel vines in California . While often used for White Zinfandel production , in the red style , Lodi Zinfandels have a reputation for being juicy and approachable . = = = Italy = = = Most Primitivo is grown in Apulia , a coastal region known as the \" heel \" of Italy , and it is estimated to be the country 's 12th most widely planted grape variety . The main three DOC areas are Primitivo di Manduria , Gioia del Colle Primitivo ( Riserva ) and Falerno del Massico Primitivo ( Riserva o Vecchio ) . The Manduria DOC covers still red wine as well as sweet ( Dolce Naturale ) and fortified ( Liquoroso Dolce Naturale , Liquoroso Secco ) wine . Falerno requires a minimum of 85 % Primitivo ; the others are 100 % Primitivo . Gioia del Colle Rosso and Rosato contain 50-60 % Primitivo , and Cilento Rosso / Rosato contains around 15 % . Historically , the grape was fermented and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont , where it was used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas . When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge , plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased . Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic , highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16 % alcohol by volume ( ABV ) . Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel . = = = Other locations = = = The Croatian form Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its own right before the link to Zinfandel was revealed . UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maleti\u0107 in Croatia , which he planted on the island of Hvar . He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005 . There is high demand for red grapes in the country , and the government has been supportive of ongoing research . Figures from the department of viticulture and enology at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski in Croatia in 2001 , there were about 2,000 vines in 2008 . Old vine Zinfandel plantings dating from the 1930s have been found in Baja California , Mexico . There are also small Zinfandel plantings in Western Australia , Mudgee in New South Wales and the McLaren Vale area of South Australia . South Africa has a small production of Zinfandel , including one estate rated among the country 's Zinfandel producers and winner of an international prize . = = Viticulture and winemaking = = Zinfandel vines are quite vigorous and grow best in climates that are warm but not too hot , because grapes may shrivel in hot weather . Zinfandel 's thin-skinned grapes grow in large , tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot . The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content . If weather conditions permit , the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine . Zinfandel is often praised for its ability to reflect both its terroir and its winemaker 's style and skill . The grapes exhibit an uneven pattern of ripening : a single bunch may contain both raisin-like , over-ripe grapes and green , unripened grapes . Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these varying levels of ripeness , while others hand-harvest the bunches , even by single berries , in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks . This extensively laborious practice is one component in the high cost of some Zinfandels . Red Zinfandel wines have been criticized for being too \" hot \" ( too alcoholic ) , although modern winemaking techniques have helped make them more approachable . On the other hand , Zinfandel producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood believe that alcohol-removing technologies , such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones , remove a sense of terroir from the wine . If a wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15 % alcohol , Peterson argues , it should be accepted on its own terms . Factors that affect the wine 's flavors include length of fermentation , length of the maceration period with skin contact , the level of oak aging , and the degrees Brix of the harvested grapes . White Zinfandel is normally harvested early at 20 \u00b0 Bx when the grapes have yet to develop much varietal character , though some examples can develop hints of tobacco and apple skin . At 23 \u00b0 Bx ( the degree that most red wine is considered \" ripe \" ) , strawberry flavors develop . Cherry flavors appear at 24 \u00b0 Bx followed by blackberry notes at 25 \u00b0 Bx . = = Synonyms = = Crljenak Ka\u0161telanski , Gioia Del Colle , Locale , Morellone , Plavac Veliki , Primaticcio , Primativo , Primitivo , Primitivo Di Gioia , Primitivo Nero , Uva Della Pergola , Uva Di Corato , Zin ( informal ) , ZPC , Black St. Peters , Zenfendal , Zinfardel , Zinfindal , Taranto , Zeinfandall , Zinfardell , Zinfindel , Zinfandal .",

                    "text": "Blackcurrant = The blackcurrant ( Ribes nigrum ) is a woody shrub in the family Grossulariaceae grown for its piquant berries . It is native to temperate parts of central and northern Europe and northern Asia where it prefers damp fertile soils and is widely cultivated both commercially and domestically . It is winter hardy but cold weather at flowering time during the spring reduces the size of the crop . Bunches of small , glossy black fruit develop along the stems in the summer and can be harvested by hand or by machine . The fruit is rich in vitamin C , various other nutrients , phytochemicals and antioxidants . Blackcurrants can be eaten raw but are usually cooked in a variety of sweet or savoury dishes . They are used to make jams , jellies and syrups and are grown commercially for the juice market . The fruit is also used in the preparation of alcoholic beverages and both fruit and foliage have uses in traditional medicine and the preparation of dyes . As a crop , the blackcurrant suffers from several pests and diseases . The most serious disease is reversion , caused by a virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite . Another is white pine blister rust which alternates between two unrelated hosts , one in the genus Ribes ( blackcurrant included ) and the other a white pine . This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America , where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease . As a result , the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector . The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable , since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America . Breeding is being undertaken in Europe and New Zealand to produce fruit with better eating qualities and bushes with greater hardiness and disease resistance . = = Description = = Ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to 1.5 metres ( 4.9 ft ) by 1.5 metres ( 4.9 ft ) . The leaves are alternate , simple , 3 to 5 cm ( 1.2 to 2.0 in ) broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin . All parts of the plant are strongly aromatic . The flowers are produced in racemes known as \" strigs \" up to 8 cm ( 3 in ) long containing ten to twenty flowers , each about 8 mm ( 0.3 in ) in diameter . Each flower has a hairy calyx with yellow glands , the five lobes of which are longer than the inconspicuous petals . There are five stamens surrounding the stigma and style and two fused carpels . The flowers open in succession from the base of the strig and are mostly insect pollinated , but some pollen is distributed by the wind . A pollen grain landing on a stigma will germinate and send a slender pollen tube down the style to the ovule . In warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive . If fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely . Frost can damage both unopened and open flowers when the temperature falls below -1.9 \u00b0 C ( 28.5 \u00b0 F ) . The flowers at the base of the strig are more protected by the foliage and are less likely to be damaged . In midsummer the strigs of green fruit ripen to edible berries , very dark purple in colour , almost black , with glossy skins and persistent calyxes at the apex , each containing many seeds . An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms ( 10 pounds ) of fruit each year . Plants from Northern Asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety , Ribes nigrum var. sibiricum , of which Ribes cyathiforme is considered a synonym . = = Cultivation = = = = = Site selection and planting = = = Blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams , or forest soils , as long as their nutrient requirements are met . They prefer damp , fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought . Although the bushes are winter hardy , frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers . A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic . Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring , but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year . Two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used . Planting certified stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses . On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of 1.5 to 1.8 metres ( 5 to 6 ft ) or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of 1.2 metres ( 4 ft ) and row separations of 2.5 metres ( 8 ft ) or more . In the UK , young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base . = = = Manures and fertilizers = = = The blackcurrant requires a number of essential nutrients to be present to enable it to thrive ; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs ; phosphorus aids growth , the setting of fruit and crop yield ; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits ; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium ; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds . An annual spring mulch of well rotted manure is ideal and poultry manure can also be used but needs prior composting with straw or other waste vegetable material . Spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils . The blackcurrant is a gross feeder and benefits from additional nitrogen , and phosphatic and potash fertilisers should also be applied annually . A balanced artificial fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of .10 to .24 kg ( 0.2 to 0.5 lb ) per plant . Weed growth can be suppressed with an organic mulch such as sawdust , bark , mushroom compost or straw , heavy plastic topped with an organic mulch cover or landscape fabric . = = = Pruning = = = Fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots . Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely , cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level . This gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit . The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting . The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots . An established bush should not be allowed to become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year . When harvesting by machine , plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged . = = = Harvesting = = = On a garden scale , the berries should be picked when dry and ripe . Commercially , most harvesting is done mechanically by straddle harvesters . These move continually down the rows , straddling a row of bushes , shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit . The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time , some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row . A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers . The bins should be stored in a cool place . Some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market . = = = Diseases and pests = = = Ribes plants are susceptible to several diseases and a number of insect pests . However , new varieties have been developed , or are being developed , to overcome some of these problems . Reversion is a serious disease transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis . It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents . Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ( \" big bud \" ) in winter , each housing thousands of microscopic mites . As pest control has limited effectiveness , severely infected bushes should be destroyed . All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free . White pine blister rust ( Cronartium ribicola ) needs two alternate hosts to complete its lifecycle . One host is plants in the genus Ribes . On the blackcurrant , it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves . The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year . The other host is any of the white pines , in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust . American gooseberry mildew and powdery mildew can infect the leaves and shoot tips , and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season . Currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( Drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance . The blackcurrant leaf midge can cause browning , crimping and distortion of leaves at the tips of shoots but it is seldom a serious problem . The blackcurrant sawfly ( Nematus ribesii ) lays its eggs on the underside of the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots , stripping off leaf after leaf . In a serious attack , the bush can be denuded of leaves . Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots , which wilt and die back . Other insect pests include scale insects , aphids and earwigs . = = = Research and breeding = = = There are many cultivars of blackcurrant . ' Baldwin ' was the mainstay of the industry for many years but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties . During the 20th century in Europe , much hybridisation work has been carried out in order to reduce the plant 's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields . This effort centred especially on Russia , Sweden and Scotland . In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country . They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance , especially in the spring , ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance . Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus . ' Ben Lomond ' was the first of the ' Ben ' varieties and was released in 1975 . This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as ' Ben Alder ' and ' Ben Tirran ' . The cultivar ' Ben Hope ' was released in 1998 with resistance to gall mite , and in the same year , ' Ben Gairn ' became available . It shows resistance to the reversion virus . For gardeners and the pick-your-own market , ' Ben Sarek ' , ' Ben Connan ' and ' Big Ben ' were introduced and have large , sweet berries . The cultivars ' Ben Connan ' , ' Ben Lomond ' and ' Ben Sarek ' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance , disease resistance , machine harvesting , fruit quality , nutritional content and fruit flavour . Varieties producing green fruit , less strongly flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants , are cultivated in Finland , where they are called \" greencurrants \" ( viherherukka ) . In Poland , the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance , fruit quality , adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting . Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry ( Ribes grossularia ) , the red currant ( Ribes rubrum ) and the flowering currant ( Ribes sanguineum ) . The resulting offspring were further back-crossed to R. nigrum . Cultivars produced include ' Tisel ' and ' Tiben ' in 2000 and ' Ores ' , ' Ruben ' and ' Tines ' in 2005 . Further cultivars ' Polares ' and ' Tihope ' are being tested . Since 1991 , New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development , as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop . Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield , large fruit size , consistency of cropping and upright habit . In North America , there is a need for this fruit to have resistance to white pine blister rust . New cultivars such as ' Crusader ' , ' Coronet ' and ' Consort ' have been developed there by crossing R. nigrum with R. ussuriense and these show resistance to the disease . However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non-resistant strains and only Consort is reliably self-fertile . Back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as ' Titania ' that have a higher yield , better disease resistance , are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting . Two new releases from a black currant breeding program in British Columbia , Canada , ' Blackcomb ' and ' Tahsis ' , were selected for their immunity to white pine blister rust and their frost tolerance . = = History = = The blackcurrant is native to northern Europe and Asia . It was cultivated in Russia by the 11th century when it was present in monastery gardens and also grown in towns and settlements . Cultivation in Europe is thought to have started around the last decades of the 17th century . Decoction of the leaves , bark or roots was also used as traditional remedies . During World War II , most fruits rich in vitamin C , such as oranges , became difficult to obtain in the United Kingdom . Since blackcurrant berries are a rich source of the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate , the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation 's crop increased significantly . From 1942 onwards , blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to children under the age of two , and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain . In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown , mostly under contract to the juicing industry . Commercially , most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market . Blackcurrants were once popular in the United States as well , but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s , when blackcurrants , as a vector of white pine blister rust , were considered a threat to the U.S. logging industry . The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966 , and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn . As a result , currant growing is making a comeback in New York , Vermont , Connecticut and Oregon . However , several statewide bans still exist including Maine , New Hampshire , Virginia and Massachusetts . Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century , the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States , and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand . Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols , dietary fibre and essential nutrients , awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing , with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market . = = Uses = = = = = Culinary uses = = = The fruit of blackcurrants can be eaten raw , but it has a strong , tart flavour . It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit 's high content of pectin and acid . For culinary use , the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a pur\u00e9e , which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice . The pur\u00e9e can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes , yogurt , ice cream , desserts , sorbets and many other sweet dishes . The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits , such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding , or apples in crumbles and pies . The juice can be used in syrups and cordials . Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of R\u00f8dgr\u00f8d , a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines . Blackcurrants are also used in savoury cooking because their astringency creates added flavour in many sauces , meat and other dishes and they are included in some unusual combinations of foods . They can be added to tomato and mint to make a salad , used to accompany roast or grilled lamb , used to accompany seafood and shellfish , used as a dipping sauce at barbecues , blended with mayonnaise , used to invigorate bananas and other tropical fruits , combined with dark chocolate or added to mincemeat in traditional mince pies at Christmas . Japan imports $ 3.6 million of New Zealand blackcurrants for uses as dietary supplements , snacks , functional food products and as quick-frozen ( IQF ) produce for culinary production as jams , jellies or preserves . = = = Beverages = = = The juice forms the basis for various popular cordials , juice drinks , juices and smoothies . Typically blended with apple or other red fruits , it is also mixed with pomegranate and grape juice . Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the ap\u00e9ritif liqueur cr\u00e8me de cassis , which in turn is added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royale . In the United Kingdom , blackcurrant cordial is often mixed with cider ( hard cider ) to make a drink called \" cider and black \" . If made with any common British lager beer , it is known as a \" lager and black \" . The addition of blackcurrant to a mix of cider and lager results in \" diesel \" or \" snakebite and black \" available at pubs . A \" black ' n ' black \" can be made by adding a small amount of blackcurrant juice to a pint of stout . The head is purple if the shot of juice is placed in the glass first . Blackcurrant juice is sometimes combined with whey in an endurance / energy-type drink . In Russia , blackcurrant leaves may be used for flavouring tea or preserves , such as salted cucumbers , and berries for home winemaking . Sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavour and astringent taste . The berries may be infused in a similar manner . In Britain , 95 % of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena ( a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum ) and similar fruit syrups and juices . = = = Food value = = = = = = = Nutrients = = = = Raw blackcurrants are 82 % water , 15 % carbohydrates , 1 % protein and 0.4 % fat ( table ) . Per 100 g serving providing 63 calories , the raw fruit has high vitamin C content ( 218 % of the Daily Value , DV ) and moderate levels of iron and manganese ( 12 % DV each ) . Other nutrients are present in negligible amounts ( less than 10 % DV , table ) . = = = = Phytochemicals = = = = Phytochemicals in the fruit and seeds , such as polyphenols , have been demonstrated , with ongoing laboratory studies assessing their potential to inhibit inflammation mechanisms of heart disease , cancer , microbial infections or neurological disorders like Alzheimer 's disease . Major anthocyanins in blackcurrant pomace are delphinidin-3-O-glucoside , delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside , cyanidin-3-O-glucoside , and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside which are retained in the juice concentrate among other yet unidentified polyphenols . Blackcurrant seed oil is rich in nutrients , especially vitamin E and unsaturated fatty acids , including alpha-linolenic acid and gamma-linolenic acid . = = = Use in traditional medicine = = = In Europe the leaves have traditionally been used for arthritis , spasmodic cough , diarrhea , as a diuretic and for treating a sore throat . The berries were made into a drink thought to be beneficial for treatment of colds and flu , for other fevers , for diaphoresis and as a diuretic . In traditional Austrian medicine , Ribes nigrum fruits have been used internally ( consumed whole or as a syrup ) for treatment of infections and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract , the locomotor system , the respiratory tract and the cardiovascular system . = = = Other uses = = = Blackcurrant seed oil is an ingredient in cosmetics preparations , often in combination with vitamin E. The leaves can be extracted to yield a yellow dye and the fruit is a source for a blue or violet dye .",

Since before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 , and particularly since the late 1970s , an Israeli Jewish fusion cuisine has developed . Israeli cuisine has adopted , and continues to adapt , elements of various styles of Jewish cuisine , particularly the Mizrahi , Sephardic and Ashkenazi styles of cooking . It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in Levantine , Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines , and foods such as falafel , hummus , msabbha , shakshouka , couscous , and za 'atar are now widely popular in Israel . Other influences on the cuisine are the availability of foods common to the Mediterranean region , especially certain kinds of fruits and vegetables , dairy products and fish ; the distinctive traditional dishes prepared at holiday times ; the tradition of keeping kosher ; and food customs specific to Shabbat and different Jewish holidays , such as challah , jachnun , malawach , gefilte fish , hamin and sufganiyot . New dishes based on agricultural products such as oranges , avocados , dairy products and fish , and others based on world trends have been introduced over the years , and chefs trained abroad have brought in elements of other international cuisines . = = History = = = = = Origins = = = Israel \u2019 s culinary traditions comprise foods and cooking methods that span three thousand years of history . Over that time , these traditions have been shaped by influences from Asia , Africa and Europe , and religious and ethnic influences have resulted in a culinary melting pot . Biblical and archaeological records provide insight into the culinary life of the region as far back as 968 BCE , in the days of the kings of ancient Israel . During the Second Temple period ( 516 BCE to 70 CE ) , Hellenistic and Roman culture heavily influenced cuisine , particularly of the priests and aristocracy of Jerusalem . Elaborate meals were served that included piquant entr\u00e9es and alcoholic drinks , fish , meat , pickled and fresh vegetables , olives , and tart or sweet fruits . The food of the ancient Israelites was based on several products that still play important roles in modern Israeli cuisine . These were known as the seven species : olives , figs , dates , pomegranates , wheat , barley and grapes . The diet , based on locally grown produce , was enhanced by imported spices , readily available due to the country \u2019 s position at the crossroads of east-west trade routes . After the destruction of the Second Temple and the exile of the majority of Jews from the land of Israel , Jewish cuisine continued to develop in the many countries where Jewish communities have existed since Late Antiquity , influenced by the economics , agriculture , and culinary traditions of those countries . = = = Old Yishuv = = = The Jewish community that lived in Ottoman Syria prior to Zionist immigration that began in 1881 was known as the Old Yishuv . The cooking style of the community was Sephardi cuisine , which developed among the Jews of Spain before their expulsion in 1492 , and in the areas to which they migrated thereafter , particularly the Balkans and Ottoman Empire . Sephardim also established communities in the Old Yishuv . Particularly in Jerusalem , they continued to develop their culinary style , influenced by Ottoman cuisine , creating a style that became known as Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine . This cuisine included pies like sambousak , pastels and burekas , vegetable gratins and stuffed vegetables , and rice and bulgur pilafs , which are now considered to be Jerusalem classics . Groups of Hasidic Jews from Eastern Europe began establishing communities in the late 18th century , and brought with them their traditional Ashkenazi cuisine , developing , however , distinct local variations , notably a peppery , caramelized noodle pudding known as kugel yerushalmi . Beginning with the First Aliyah in 1881 , Jews began immigrating to the area from Eastern Europe in larger numbers , particularly from Poland and Russia . These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they had grown up with , and adapt by using local produce , especially vegetables such as zucchini , peppers , eggplant , artichoke and chickpeas . The first Hebrew cookbook , written by Erna Meyer , and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women 's International Zionist Organization ( WIZO ) , exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking . The bread , olives , cheese and raw vegetables they adopted became the basis for the kibbutz breakfast , which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels , and in various forms in most Israeli homes today . = = = Early years of the State = = = The State of Israel faced enormous military and economic challenges in its early years , and the period from 1948 to 1958 was a time of food rationing and austerity , known as tzena . In this decade , over one million Jewish immigrants , mainly from Arab countries , but also including European Holocaust survivors , inundated the new state . They arrived when only basic foods were available and ethnic dishes had to be modified with a range of mock or simulated foods , such as chopped \u201c liver \u201d from eggplant , and turkey as a substitute for veal schnitzel for Ashkenazim , kubbeh made from frozen fish instead of ground meat for Iraqi Jews , and turkey in place of the lamb kebabs of the Mizrahi Jews . These adaptations remain as a legacy of that time . Substitutes , such as the wheat-based rice substitute , ptitim , were introduced , and versatile vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat . Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from inexpensive canned tomato paste and puree , hummus , tahina , and mayonnaise in tubes . Meat was scarce , and it was not until the late 1950s that herds of beef cattle were introduced into the agricultural economy . Khubeza , a local variety of the mallow plant , became an important food source during the War of Independence . During the siege of Jerusalem , when convoys of food could not reach the city , Jerusalemites went out to the fields to pick khubeza leaves , which are high in iron and vitamins . The Jerusalem radio station , Kol Hamagen , broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand . In the past decade , food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day . Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants . The dish from the Independence war is called Ktzitzot Khubeza and still eaten by Israelis today . = = = Impact of immigration = = = Immigrants to Israel have incorporated elements of the cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came . During approximately fifty years before 1948 , there were successive waves of Jewish immigration , which brought with them a whole range of foods and cooking styles . Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and strudels , while Russian Jews brought borsht and herring dishes , such as schmaltz herring and vorschmack ( gehakte herring ) . Ashkenazi dishes include chicken soup , schnitzel , lox , chopped liver , gefilte fish , knishes , kishka and kugel . The first Israeli patisseries were opened by Ashkenazi Jews , who popularized cakes and pastries from central and Eastern Europe , such as yeast cakes ( babka ) , nut spirals ( schnecken ) , chocolate rolls and layered pastries . After 1948 , the greatest impact came from the large migration of Jews from Turkey , Iraq , Kurdistan and Yemen , and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa , particularly Morocco . Typically , the staff of army kitchens , schools , hospitals , hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi , Kurdish and Yemenite Jews , and this has had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country . Mizrahi cuisine , the cuisine of Jews from North Africa , features grilled meats , sweet and savory puff pastries , rice dishes , stuffed vegetables , pita breads and salads , and shares many similarities with Arab cuisine . Other North African dishes popular in Israel include couscous , shakshouka , matbucha , carrot salad and chraime ( slices of fish cooked in a spicy tomato sauce ) . Sephardic dishes , with Balkan and Turkish influences incorporated in Israeli cuisine include burekas , yogurt and taramosalata . Yemenite Jewish foods include jachnun , malawach , skhug and kubane . Iraqi dishes popular in Israel include amba , various types of kubba , stuffed vegetables ( mhasha ) , kebab , sambusac , sabich and pickled vegetables ( hamutzim ) . = = = Modern trends = = = As Israeli agriculture developed and new kinds of fruits and vegetables appeared on the market , cooks and chefs began to experiment and devise new dishes with them . They also began using \" biblical \" ingredients such as honey , figs , and pomegranates , and indigenous foods such as prickly pears ( tzabar ) and chickpeas . Since the late 1970s , there has been an increased interest in international cuisine , cooking with wine and herbs , and vegetarianism . A more sophisticated food culture in Israel began to develop when cookbooks , such as \u201c From the Kitchen with Love \u201d by Ruth Sirkis , published in 1974 , introduced international cooking trends , and together with the opening of restaurants serving cuisines such as Chinese , Italian and French , encouraged more dining out . The 1980s were a formative decade : the increased optimism after the signing of the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 , the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine . In addition , high quality , locally produced ingredients became increasingly available . For example , privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat , sheep and cow \u2019 s milk , which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public . In 1983 , the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class , semi-dry and dry wines . New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil . The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish , and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit , vegetables and herbs . Ethnic heritage cooking , both Sephardic and Ashkenazi , has made a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society . Apart from home cooking , many ethnic foods are now available in street markets , supermarkets and restaurants , or are served at weddings and bar mitzvahs , and people increasingly eat foods from ethnic backgrounds other than their own . Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups is becoming standard as a multi-ethnic food culture develops . The 1990s saw an increasing interest in international cuisines . Sushi , in particular , has taken hold as a popular style for eating out and as an entr\u00e9e for events . In restaurants , fusion cuisine , with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread . In the 2000s , the trend of \u201c eating healthy \u201d with an emphasis on organic and whole grain foods has become prominent , and medical research has led many Israelis to re-embrace the Mediterranean diet , with its touted health benefits . = = Characteristics = = Geography has a large influence on Israel cuisine , and foods common in the Mediterranean region , such as olives , wheat , chickpeas , dairy products , fish , and vegetables such as tomatoes , eggplants , and zucchini are prominent in Israeli cuisine . Fresh fruits and vegetables are plentiful in Israel and are cooked and served in many ways . There are various climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow a variety of products to be grown . Citrus trees such as orange , lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain . Figs , pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas . The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes , kiwis and bananas , while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes , apples and cherries . Israeli eating customs also conform to the wider Mediterranean region , with lunch , rather than dinner , being the focal meal of a regular workday . \u201c Kibbutz foods \u201d have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts , and may consist of various types of cheeses , both soft and hard , yogurt , labne and sour cream , vegetables and salads , olives , hard-boiled eggs or omelets , pickled and smoked herring , a variety of breads , and fresh orange juice and coffee . In addition , Jewish holidays influence the cuisine , with the preparation of traditional foods at holiday times , such as various types of challah ( braided bread ) for Shabbats and Festivals , jelly doughnuts ( sufganiyot ) for Hanukah , the hamantaschen pastry ( oznei haman ) for Purim , charoset , a type of fruit paste , for Passover , and dairy foods for Shavuot . The Shabbat dinner , eaten on Friday , and to a lesser extent the Shabbat lunch , is a significant meal in Israeli homes , together with holiday meals . Although not all Jews in Israel keep kosher , the tradition of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes , public institutions and many restaurants , including the separation of milk and meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods , especially pork and shellfish . During Passover , bread and other leavened foods are prohibited to observant Jews and matza and leaven-free foods are substituted . = = Foods = = Israel does not have a universally recognized national dish ; however , many consider it to be falafel , deep fried balls of seasoned , ground chickpeas . Street vendors throughout Israel sell falafel and it is a favorite \" street food \" . One book called the Israeli breakfast \" the Jewish state 's contribution to world cuisine \" . = = = Salads and appetizers = = = Vegetable salads are eaten with most meals , including the traditional Israeli breakfast , which will usually include eggs , bread , and dairy products such as yogurt or cottage cheese . For lunch and dinner , salad may be served a side dish . A light meal of salad ( \" Salat \" ) , hummus and French fries ( \" Chips \" ) served in a pita is referred to as hummuschipsalat . Israeli salad is typically made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil , lemon juice , salt and pepper . Variations include the addition of diced red or green bell peppers , grated carrot , finely shredded cabbage or lettuce , sliced radish , fennel , spring onions and chives , chopped parsley , or other herbs and spices such as mint , za 'atar and sumac . Although popularized by the kibbutzim , versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places . For example , Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers , North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper , and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar , without oil , in the dressing . Tabbouleh is a Levantine vegetarian dish ( sometimes considered a salad ) traditionally made of tomatoes , finely chopped parsley , mint , bulgur and onion , and seasoned with olive oil , lemon juice , and salt . Some Israeli variations of the salad use pomegranate seeds instead of tomatoes . Sabich salad is a variation of the well known Israeli dish Sabich , the ingredients of the salad are eggplant , boiled eggs / hard boiled eggs , tahini , Israeli salad , potato , parsley and amba . Kubba is a dish made of rice / semolina / burghul ( cracked wheat ) , minced onions and finely ground lean beef , lamb or chicken . The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with minced beef , chicken or lamb . It was brought to Israel by Jews of Iraqi , Kurdish and Syrian origin . Sambusak is a semi-circular pocket of dough filled with mashed chickpeas , fried onions and spices . There is another variety filled with meat , fried onions , parsley , spices and pine nuts , which is sometimes mixed with mashed chickpeas and breakfast version with feta or tzfat cheese and za 'atar . It can be fried and cooked . Sigarim are soft minced meat with onions and spices or mashed patato filling wrapped in phyllo-dough , and deep fried in oil or oven baked . They are commonly served at weddings and other celebrations .. Roasted vegetables includes bell peppers , chili peppers , tomatoes , onions , eggplants and also sometimes potatoes and zucchini . Usually served with grilled meat Hamusim are pickled vegetables made by soaking in water and salt ( and sometimes olive oil ) in a pot and withdrawing them from air . Ingredients can include : cucumber , cabbage , eggplant , carrot , turnip , radish , onion , caper , lemon , olives , cauliflower , tomatoes , chili pepper , bell pepper , garlic and beans . A large variety of eggplant salads and dips are made with roasted eggplants . Baba ghanoush , called salat \u1e25atzilim in Israel , is made with tahina and other seasonings such as garlic , lemon juice , onions , herbs and spices . The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an open flame so that the pulp has a smoky taste . A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called salat \u1e25atzilim b 'mayonnaise . Eggplant salads are also made with yogurt , or with feta cheese , chopped onion and tomato , or in the style of Romanian Jews , with roasted red pepper . Tahina is often used as a dressing for falafel , serves as a cooking sauce for meat and fish , and forms the basis of sweets such as halva . Hummus is a cornerstone of Israeli cuisine , and consumption in Israel has been compared by food critic Elena Ferretti to \" peanut butter in America , Nutella in Europe or Vegemite in Australia \" . Hummus in pita is a common lunch for schoolchildren , and is a popular addition to many meals . Supermarkets offer a variety of commercially prepared hummus , and some Israelis will go out of their way for fresh hummus prepared at a hummusia , an establishment devoted exclusively to selling hummus . Salat avocado is an Israeli-style avocado salad , with lemon juice and chopped scallions ( spring onions ) , was introduced by farmers who planted avocado trees on the coastal plain in the 1920s .

Israel 's first prime minister , David Ben-Gurion , is reputed to have asked the Osem company to devise this substitute , and it was thus nicknamed \" Ben-Gurion 's rice \" . Ptitim can be boiled like pasta , or prepared pilaf-style by saut\u00e9ing and then boiling in water or stock , or baking them in a casserole .

Sephardi hamin contains chicken or meat , rice , beans , garlic , sweet or regular potatoes , seasonings such as turmeric and cinnamon , and whole eggs in the shell known as haminados . Moroccan Jews prepare variations known as dafina or skhina ( or s \u2032 hina ) with meat , onion , marrow bones , potatoes , chickpeas , wheat berries , eggs and spices such as turmeric , cumin , paprika and pepper . Iraqi Jews prepare tebit , using chicken and rice . For desserts or informal gatherings on Shabbat , home bakers still bake a wide variety of cakes on Fridays to be enjoyed on the Sabbath , or purchased from bakeries or stores , cakes such as sponge cake , citrus semolina cake , cinnamon or chocolate babkas , and fruit and nut cakes . = = = Rosh Hashanah = = = Rosh Hashana , the Jewish New Year , is widely celebrated with festive family meals and symbolic foods . Sweetness is the main theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey , and end with honey cake . The challah is usually round , often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey , and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree , such as pomegranates , carrots , leeks and beets . Fish dishes , symbolizing abundance , are served ; for example , gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim , while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish , chraime . Honey cake ( lekach ) is often served as dessert , accompanied by tea or coffee . Dishes cooked with pomegranate juice are common during this period . = = = Hanukkah = = = The holiday of Hanukkah is marked by the consumption of traditional Hanukkah foods fried in oil in commemoration of the miracle in which a small quantity of oil sufficient for one day lasted eight days . The two most popular Hannukah foods are potato pancakes , levivot , also known by the Yiddish latkes ; and jelly doughnuts , known as sufganiyot in Hebrew , pontshkes ( in Yiddish ) or bimuelos ( in Ladino ) , as these are deep-fried in oil . Hannukah pancakes are made from a variety of ingredients , from the traditional potato or cheese , to more modern innovations , among them corn , spinach , zucchini and sweet potato . Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the standard strawberry jelly filling , and these include chocolate , vanilla or cappuccino cream , and others . In recent years downsized , \" mini \" sufganiyot have also appeared due to concerns about calories . = = = Tu Bishvat = = = Tu Bishvat is a minor Jewish holiday , usually sometime in late January or early February , that marks the \" New Year of the Trees \" . Customs include planting trees and eating dried fruits and nuts , especially figs , dates , raisins , carob , and almonds . Many Israelis , both religious and secular , celebrate with a kabbalistic-inspired Tu Bishvat seder that includes a feast of fruits and four cups of wine according to the ceremony presented in special haggadot modeled on the Haggadah of Passover for this purpose . = = = Purim = = = The festival of Purim celebrates the deliverance of the Jewish people from the plot of Haman to annihilate them in the ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire , as described in the Book of Esther . It is a day of rejoicing and merriment , on which children , and many adults , wear costumes . It is customary to eat a festive meal , seudat Purim , in the late afternoon , often with wine as the prominent beverage , in keeping with the atmosphere of merry-making . Many people prepare packages of food that they give to neighbors , friends , family , and colleagues on Purim . These are called mishloach manot ( \" sending of portions \" ) , and often include wine and baked goods , fruit and nuts , and sweets . The food most associated with Purim is called ozne haman ( \" Haman 's ears \" ) . These are three-cornered pastries filled most often with poppy seed , but also other fruit fillings . The triangular shape may have been influenced by old illustrations of Haman , in which he wore a three-cornered hat . = = = Passover = = = The week-long holiday of Passover in the spring commemorates the Exodus from Egypt , and in Israel is usually a time for visiting friends and relatives , travelling , and on the first night of Passover , the traditional ritual dinner , known as the Seder . Foods containing \u1e25ametz \u2013 leaven or yeast \u2013 may not be eaten during Passover . This means bread , pastries and certain fermented beverages , such as beer , cannot be consumed . Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes , known as kitniyot . Over the centuries , Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today . Chicken soup with matza dumplings ( kneidlach ) is often a starter for the Seder meal among Israelis of all the ethnic backgrounds . Spring vegetables , such as asparagus and artichokes often accompany the meal . Restaurants in Israel have come up with creative alternatives to \u1e25ametz ingredients to create pasta , hamburger buns , pizza , and other fast foods in kosher-for-Passover versions by using potato starch and other non-standard ingredients . After Passover , the celebration of Mimouna takes place , a tradition brought to Israel by the Jewish communities of North Africa . In the evening , a feast of fruit , confectionery and pastries is set out for neighbors and visitors to enjoy . Most notably , the first leaven after Passover , a thin crepe called a mofletta , eaten with honey , syrup or jam , is served . The occasion is celebrated the following day by outdoor picnics at which salads and barbecued meat feature prominently . = = = Shavuot = = = In the early summer , the Jewish harvest festival of Shavuot is celebrated . Shavuot marks the peak of the new grain harvest and the ripening of the first fruits , and is a time when milk was historically most abundant . To celebrate this holiday , many types of dairy foods are eaten . These include cheeses and yogurts , cheese-based pies and quiches called pashtidot , cheese blintzes , and cheesecake prepared with soft white cheese ( gvina levana ) or cream cheese .",

Two general types , a small , light traditional mountain horse and a taller , sportier modern type , are found . Always black in color , M\u00e9rens must meet strict physical standards in order to be registered in the stud book . The breed is known for its sure-footedness on mountain terrain , as well as for its endurance , hardiness and docility . The French breed registry organizes regional offices , and partners with other national organizations in Europe to preserve and promote the breed . The organization enforces rigorous selection of breeding stock , with a goal of increasing quality in the breed . In the past , the M\u00e9rens was used for farm work , draft work and as pack horses . Today it is mainly used as a saddle horse , although some members of the breed have been successful in carriage driving . Many M\u00e9rens are taken on an annual transhumance ( seasonal migration ) , in which they are moved higher in the mountains during the summer and into the valleys for the winter . An old practice , it fell into disfavor , but has recently re-emerged . Thought to have originated in prehistoric times , the exact early history of the M\u00e9rens remains a mystery . Theories on its origins include descent from Iberian horses , similar to many regional mountain horses , or possibly Oriental horses brought to the area by settlers from the east . Small black horses from the area of Ari\u00e8ge have been recorded as early as the time of Julius Caesar , as well as being associated with Charlemagne . They pulled artillery for Napoleon 's Grand Army , as well as being used by farmers , dock workers , miners and smugglers moving goods through the Pyrenees mountains . They were frequently seen at local horse fairs , and were used to breed mules in a cross with Catalan donkeys . By the end of the 19th century , they had gained a reputation as light cavalry horses . At the same time , however , uncontrolled crossbreeding led to a decline in the purebred population , and in 1908 the local agricultural society was put in charge of the breed . The breed registry was created in 1933 , and in 1948 the first stud book was created under the control of the French National Stud . In the second half of the 20th century , the population sharply declined , as mechanization transferred work in cavalry and agriculture to machines . By the 1970s , the M\u00e9rens was on the verge of extinction , with only 40 horses registered in the stud book . The breed was saved by members of the hippie movement , who re-settled in the Ari\u00e8ge mountains , boosting the local economy and restarting breeding programs . The M\u00e9rens also benefited from a new surge in popularity in riding horses , and between 1975 and 1985 its population rebounded , leading the breeding program to be considered an example for the conservation of rare breeds . The herd size remains relatively small , however , and one genetic study considers the traditional type of the breed to be endangered and recommends that efforts should be focused on its preservation . = = Naming = = The M\u00e9rens was traditionally bred in the village of M\u00e9rens-les-Vals in the department of Ari\u00e8ge . The French National Stud calls the breed the \" M\u00e9rens \" , a name which was officially mentioned for the first time in 1866 . Laetitia Bataille , a French horse breeding specialist , considers the use of \" M\u00e9rens \" incorrect , and prefers the names \" Ari\u00e9geois \" , \" Cheval de M\u00e9rens \" or \" M\u00e9rengais \" . Jean-Louis Savignol , a traditionalist breeder , prefers the name \" M\u00e9ringais \" , saying that \" M\u00e9rens \" refers to the village and the valley in which it is located , not the horse breed . = = Characteristics = = The traditional M\u00e9rens is a small , light horse , well adapted to the mountains , while modern M\u00e9rens are increasingly more sporting in style . The breed is known for its elegance , and in 2005 was ranked as one of the 23 most beautiful horse breeds by the French magazine Cheval Pratique . Since 1948 , M\u00e9rens horses must meet certain physical standards in order to be admitted to the stud book . In this time , the admission criteria have changed several times . Currently , the general appearance of a M\u00e9rens is strong and compact , with energetic movement . The M\u00e9rens , like many mountain horses , is calm , docile and hardworking . The report of a comprehensive study on the heritability of the breed 's temperament was published in Equ 'id\u00e9e in 2010 . It is a versatile breed , and very hardy , able to live all year outside without suffering from the weather . M\u00e9rens are known for their endurance , agility and sure-footedness . They require very little care , and can survive on poor food , even when working . They are resistant to cold , but react poorly to heat . M\u00e9rens foals are often born in the snow , without human intervention , but are usually handled and accustomed to humans from an early age . They show increased resistance to the anticoagulant properties of some varieties of fern , the consumption of which can cause bloody sweats and blood in the urine in other horses . The breed standard for the M\u00e9rens gives an ideal height of 14.1 to 15.1 hands ( 57 to 61 inches , 145 to 155 cm ) and a weight of 400 to 500 kilograms ( 880 to 1,100 lb ) . The desired size for stallions is 14.2 1 \u2044 2 hands ( 58.5 inches , 149 cm ) and 14.1 hands for mares . Horses smaller than 14.2 hands ( 58 inches , 147 cm ) can be considered ponies for some equestrian competitions . Horses bred in the valleys and plains are larger than those bred in the mountains ; the latter average around 12.3 1 \u2044 2 hands ( 51.5 inches , 131 cm ) . The coat is always black , but may have a reddish cast during the winter . Foals may be born black , silver-grey or coffee-colored , but become black as they grow . Dappling on the body is desirable . The head has a straight or slightly concave facial profile , a flat forehead , and wide , short ears . A distinguishing characteristic of the breed is a \" beard \" of hair growing below the cheeks . Small white markings are allowed on the face , but never on the legs . The neck is of medium length in the modern M\u00e9rens , and often shorter and broader in the traditional version . The shoulders are sloping and moderately long , and the chest wide and deep . Pronounced withers are favored in those M\u00e9rens used for pack horses , but as with most mountain horses , many traditional M\u00e9rens have wide , flat withers . The girth is deep . The back is generally shorter in modern M\u00e9rens than in the traditional version , where horses with long , strong backs were preferred for use as pack horses . The croup is well-muscled and the tail low-set . The legs are strong and solid , with well-defined joints . They tend to be quite short , and some have hocks set too close together , a recurrent fault in mountain horses . The feet are large and well-formed , allowing the horses to go without shoes . There is abundant feathering on the lower legs . = = Registration = = In France , the breed is organized by SHERPA ( Syndicat hippique des \u00e9leveurs de la race pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne ari\u00e9geoise / Union of Horse Breeders of the Ariege Pyrenees ) in La Bastide-de-Serou , which has about 400 members and 600 horses in the stud book . SHERPA unites eleven regional offices whose purpose is to organize M\u00e9rens breeders and enthusiasts . The role of SHERPA is to decide the overall direction of the breed in partnership with the French National Stud . It promotes the M\u00e9rens at fairs , national shows and international exhibitions , as well as publishing newsletters and breeder lists . SHERPA also organizes the annual breed show in Bouan . Only purebred M\u00e9rens may be registered in the breed stud book . The selection of stallions is rigorous , based on tests at the age of three . The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character . The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions , and during the three-year-old inspections , they must perform a dressage test , a cross-country jumping test , a test on the longe line and a physical inspection . The M\u00e9rens has one of the most stringent inspection procedures , and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed . Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud . French breeding of the M\u00e9rens is divided between two schools of thought . The first is traditional breeders seeking to preserve the original type , that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known . The second comes from the conversion of the M\u00e9rens to a leisure horse in the 1980s , and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed . This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed . Several countries besides France have populations of M\u00e9rens , and a few have breed registries and stud books that are recognized by the French . In Italy , the M\u00e9rens is the only foreign breed among the \" breeds of limited distribution \" recognised by the AIA , the national breeders ' association . M\u00e9rens are found mostly in northwestern Italy , in the provinces of Cuneo and Turin , but has spread to other mountain regions such as the valleys of Bergamo and Trento . The Italian breed registry for the M\u00e9rens is based in Cuneo . A Belgian non-profit organization has been organizing the breed in that country since June 2005 , and was recognized as an official stud book by the Belgian Ministry of Agriculture in August 2006 . An agreement has been signed with the French breed registry to recognize the Belgian stud book as a daughter organization . M\u00e9rens are also present in the Netherlands , Switzerland and Germany , where there are recognized stud books and active breeding populations . There are some M\u00e9rens in the Czech Republic and members of the breed have also been exported to India and Tunisia . = = Transhumance = = The department of Ariege is known for the annual transhumance ( seasonal migration ) of cattle , sheep and horses , including many members of the M\u00e9rens breed . Each year , in June , hundreds of horses are moved to summer pastures at around 1,500 metres ( 4,900 ft ) in altitude , where they live in a semi-feral state , traveling on steep mountain paths and weathering storms and other climactic variations . In October , they return to the valleys for the winter . An old tradition , the transhumance fell out of favor , but has been reintroduced to Ariege by the association Autrefois en Couserans . Since 2000 , the association has worked with local horse breeders to promote the return to the annual practice . Around 500 M\u00e9rens make the transhumance each year . Herds are usually led by an experienced mare marked with a bell , as is done with cattle . A stallion can accompany the mares with foals to maintain cohesion of the herd and prevent it from mixing with other herds on the mountain slopes . The behavior of transhumant herds is midway between that of feral horses and domesticated horses who are around humans year-round . Some horses , raised high in the mountains , stay there year-round and do not perform the transhumance . = = History = = The history of the M\u00e9rens is closely linked to its homeland in the Pyrenees , as evidenced by the many myths and legends in which it plays a role . The origins of the M\u00e9rens are very old , and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time . It is native to the upper valley of Ariege , near Andorra . The direct ancestor of the M\u00e9rens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period , approximately 15,000 years ago . These wild horses probably moved to the mountains to escape global warming that accompanied the end of the last glacial period . The physical characteristics of the M\u00e9rens are the result of the harsh mountain environment where they live , and they are reminiscent of the horses in the cave drawings at Niaux , made some 13,000 years ago . These images depict animals with dense coats and a skull shaped like the modern M\u00e9rens , with a beard-like protrusion of hair under the jawbone . The M\u00e9rens may be of Iberian origin , as are most breeds from the area of the Pyrenees . It resembles the Norwegian Dole Gudbrandsdal and the British Fell and Dales ponies . Unlike the latter , the M\u00e9rens has never been crossed with the Friesian horse . Another theory of origin for the M\u00e9rens is based on the straight or concave facial profile ( which distinguishes them from the convex-profiled Iberian horses ) , and asserts that they are descended from Oriental horses brought to Ariege by settlers from the east . With the isolation of their mountain homeland , the M\u00e9rens has undergone very little intermingling with foreign breeds . = = = Antiquity and Middle Ages = = = Julius Caesar mentions small black horses that resemble the M\u00e9rens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico ( Commentaries on the Gallic War ) , when discussing the defeat of Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry . Historian Paul Prunet was the first to link the animals discussed by Caesar to the M\u00e9rens , although the relationship has not been definitely established . The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy , with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix . The M\u00e9rens may have been used as a pack animal by the Romans , who may have taken some of the animals with them when they left . The small black horse from the Pyrenees is described throughout antiquity . There are also several mentions of what may be M\u00e9rens during the Middle Ages . They have been associated with Charlemagne , and a Carolingian statue showing Charlemagne on a small horse has been examined , and shown that the animal resembles a M\u00e9rens , standing no more than 13.3 hands ( 55 inches , 140 cm ) at the shoulder . The legend of the founding of L 'Hospitalet-pr\u00e8s-l 'Andorre depicts a traveler who , exhausted by the cold , kills his horse and buries himself in the steaming bowels , swearing that he will build a small hospital in the place if he survives . The local Cathars held a special place in their religion for horses , especially through their belief in the transmigration of souls . There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses with them when they died . In the 12th century , the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Ch\u00e2teau de Monts\u00e9gur on the back of a small , sure-footed black horse . In the 14th century , the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III , Count of Foix . = = = 18th and 19th centuries = = = Horses from Ariege were requisitioned for Napoleon 's Grand Army during his Russian campaign . They were used mainly to pull artillery , as were most horses of this type from French territory at the beginning of the 19th century . A popular legend has them becoming famous during the crossing of the Berezina River during the Battle of Berezina . The M\u00e9rens has long been used as a delivery and courier horse , as well as being used by local farmers . It has also been used by the winemakers of Languedoc , gardeners and dock workers , as well as continuing to be used by French armies , who appreciated its endurance . The breed was used in the mines , both under saddle and in harness . It was used by smugglers moving goods through the mountains between France and Spain , mainly carrying wood and minerals , and was known for its endurance and sense of direction . M\u00e9rens horses were sold at the Tarascon-sur-Ariege horse fair , and were popular with merchants from the large cities . The breed was sometimes called \" Tarasconnais \" , after the town , and was famous for the high quality of its legs and the ability to survive on poor food . It was used to breed mules , and the Pyrenees mule was derived from a cross between Catalan donkeys and horses of the Breton , M\u00e9rens and other breeds . Before World War I , almost 1,000 Pyrenees mules were born annually in the Ariege department . The first breed show was organized in 1872 . By the end of the 19th century , horses from the Pyrenees were known for their use as light cavalry . They were praised for their agility , sure-footedness , robust constitutions , and endurance , a result of their semi-feral existence in the Pyrenees mountains . = = = 20th century = = = Starting the late 19th century , uncontrolled crossbreeding created a decline in the population of purebred M\u00e9rens . By the early 20th century , some breeders in L 'Hospitalet and M\u00e9rens-les-Vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to the original M\u00e9rens . These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional M\u00e9rens , which they valued for its hardiness and versatility . In 1908 , control of breeding was given to the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d \u2019 Agriculture de l \u2019 Ari\u00e8ge ( Agricultural Society of Ariege ) , Gabriel Lamarque , who was dedicated to the preservation of the breed . In 1933 , the Syndicat d '\u00e9levage du M\u00e9rens ( Breeding Society of M\u00e9rens ) was created , and in 1948 the first stud book was created under the control of the French National Stud . In 1946 , the French army ceased to use the M\u00e9rens for drawing artillery in the mountains , and this corresponded to the beginning of the decline of the breed . The population fell dramatically during the second half of the 20th century , due to the modernization and mechanization of transport and agriculture . In 1950 in Senegal , the M\u00e9rens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than the native M 'Bayar , but the breeding program was not enough to significantly increase the M\u00e9rens population . The use of the M\u00e9rens in agriculture continued into the 1970s , and like many French draft breeds , it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat . The mountains of Ariege acted as a sanctuary , preventing the M\u00e9rens , as well as other breeds such as Gascon cattle and Tarasconnaise sheep , from disappearing completely . By the early 1970s , however , the M\u00e9rens was on the verge of extinction . By the early 1970s , there remained only 40 M\u00e9rens horses registered in the breed studbook . The breed was saved from extinction by utopian communities believing in an ecological apocalypse . As part of the hippie movement , people wanting to live on the fringe of society settled in the small villages of Ariege . They boosted the local economy , including encouraging the resumption of the breeding of M\u00e9rens . At the same time , the story of the semi-feral horse Bonbon became a local phenomenon . This M\u00e9rens , orphaned following an accident , was raised on bottle-fed goat milk . He was then sold to a horse-dealer before later returning to his homeland and winning prizes as a stallion . He died at twenty , having returned to his herd high in the mountains . Meanwhile , the M\u00e9rens breed was revived as a fashionable animal of leisure by Lucien Lafont de Sentenac , a national expert in horse breeding . He moved the efforts of farmers towards breeding sport pony-style animals , and the breed , originally called the \" M\u00e9rens horse \" , was renamed the \" M\u00e9rens pony \" for commercial and administrative reasons . With good breeding management and promotion , the population numbers of the breed gradually recovered . Between 1975 and 1985 , the number of M\u00e9rens doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 animals , and its rescue is considered a good example of saving an endangered breed . In 1977 , the M\u00e9rens was introduced to the island of R\u00e9union , where its breeding is now part of the local economy . It is used as a saddle horse and for hauling . The breed is also used for equestrian tourism on the mountains of the island , where it is particularly well suited for the steep terrain and climate , taking tourists into volcanic regions covered in ash . A national center for the breeding of M\u00e9rens was open in 1990 by SHERPA to offer support for the preservation of the breed . The equestrian center includes a living museum for the presentation of the breed . In 1997 , SHERPA offered a M\u00e9rens to then-Prime Minister of Britain Tony Blair . On January 1 , 1998 , the M\u00e9rens was removed from the classification of \" pony \" and returned to the category of \" horse \" by the French National Stud . In 2000 , the M\u00e9rens breed was chosen by Jean-Louis Savignol to launch the first breeding farm for certified organic horses intended for leisure use rather than human consumption . The horses are fed a natural diet , dewormed with a mixture of garlic and clay , treated using a combination of homeopathy and osteopathy , and moved high in the mountains during the transhumance each year . = = = Present = = = Today , M\u00e9rens closest to the original type and lifestyle are found in the valleys of the high mountains of the Pyrenees , near Andorra . The majority of M\u00e9rens breeding still takes place in Ariege , the traditional homeland of the breed . However , they can also be found in almost all regions of France , including the Alps , the C\u00e9vennes , the Centre , the Massif Central and the \u00cele-de-France . Besides the annual breed show in Bouan , M\u00e9rens are also commonly seen at the Paris International Agricultural Show and other major horse shows . The total herd size is relatively small . The population numbers stabilized somewhat at the beginning of the 21st century , with around 1500 broodmares , 150 active stallions and 500 births per year . In 2006 , 455 new foals were registered , 1,051 mares and 89 stallions were listed as active breeding stock and there were 306 breeders , a term applied to anyone who has at least one active broodmare . In the same year , the M\u00e9rens made up 2 percent of total horses in France . A genetic study in 2008 considers the original type of the breed to be endangered . The author suggested that the M\u00e9rens should be a conservation priority in order to maintain the maximum genetic diversity among French horse breeds . = = Uses = = In the past M\u00e9rens horses were used for farm work , particularly on steep or difficult terrain , as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or sledges . Today , following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type , they are used principally as saddle horses , especially for trekking in mountainous areas ; but have also proved successful in carriage driving . Some have been used for vaulting , dressage , show jumping and three-day eventing . The M\u00e9rens is now considered a multi-purpose recreational horse that is also attached to the cultural identity of the Ariege region . They are used for leisure and competitive trail riding . They are consistently ranked in the French national competitive trail riding championships , and in 1998 , a M\u00e9rens finished second in the European Championships . In 1998 , St\u00e9phane Bigot made a crossing of the Pyrenees on a M\u00e9rens . Many tourist facilities now offer guided trail rides through the mountains of Ariege on M\u00e9rens horses , with some centers having a stable consisting entirely of members of the breed . Several equine therapy centers use the M\u00e9rens in their program . Other uses for the breed include various agricultural work , including logging , where sure-footed mountain horses can be used to access areas where equipment cannot go . Mounted police sometimes use the M\u00e9rens . A few are bred for their milk , which can be used in the manufacture of various products .",

It originated in the United Kingdom and is one of the more popular breeds in many countries . Since 2000 , it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 18th most popular pure-breed in the United States ( 2013 Registration Statistics ) . It has a silky , smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail . The breed standard recognizes four colours : Blenheim ( chestnut and white ) , Tricolor ( black / white / tan ) , Black and Tan , and Ruby . The breed is generally friendly , affectionate and good with both children and other animals ; however , they require a lot of human interaction . The expected average lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is under ten years . The King Charles changed inordinately in the late 17th century , when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds . Until the 1920s , the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel . Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration of the breed , a dog resembling Charles II 's King Charles Spaniel of the Restoration . Various health issues affect this particular breed . Cavalier King Charles Spaniel descends from small toy Spaniels like the pug he was brought to Scotland from continental Europe in the 1500s where he became a fashionable lap dog for the noble class . King Charles II was a huge fan and lent his name to the breed . = = History = = During the early part of the 18th century , John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough , kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting . The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse . His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim . Because of this influence , the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim . Attempts were made to recreate the original King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century , using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniels . These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton , 16th Baroness Wentworth , in the book \" Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels , Pekingese , Japanese and Pomeranians \" published under the name of the \" Hon. Mrs Neville Lytton \" in 1911 . = = = Divergence from King Charles Spaniel = = = In 1926 , the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of twenty-five pounds each as a prize for the best male and females of \" Blenheim Spaniels of the old type , as shown in pictures of Charles II of England 's time , long face , no stop , flat skull , not inclined to be domed , with spot in centre of skull . \" The breeders of the era were appalled , although several entered what they considered to be sub-par King Charles Spaniels in the competition . Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition , but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed . The first standard was created , based on a dog named \" Ann 's Son \" owned by Mostyn Walker , and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as \" King Charles Spaniels , Cavalier type \" . The Second World War caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed , with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages . For instance , in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel , the population of sixty dogs dropped to three during the 1940s . Following the war , just six dogs would survive as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend . These dogs were Ann 's Son , his litter brother Wizbang Timothy , Carlo of Ttiweh , Duce of Braemore , Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh . The numbers increased gradually , and in 1945 the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . The history of the breed in America is relatively recent . The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown , together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts , she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day . In 1994 , the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club . The Cavalier would go on to be recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995 , and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers . = = Description = = Historically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a lap dog and is small for a spaniel , with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds . Breed standards state that height of a Cavalier should be between 12 to 13 inches ( 30 to 33 cm ) with a proportionate weight between 10 to 18 pounds ( 4.5 to 8.2 kg ) . The tail is usually not docked , and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length . Standards state that it should be free from curl , although a slight wave is allowed . Feathering can grow on their ears , feet , legs and tail in adulthood . Standards require this be kept long , with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed 's features . The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can be often confused with each other . In the United Kingdom , the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spaniel while in the United States , one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles . The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago . There are several major differences between the two breeds , with the primary difference being the size . While the Cavalier weighs on average between 10 to 18 pounds ( 4.5 to 8.2 kg ) , the King Charles is smaller at 9 to 12 pounds ( 4.1 to 5.4 kg ) . In addition their facial features while similar , are different ; the Cavalier 's ears are set higher and its skull is flat while the King Charles 's is domed . Finally the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin . = = = Colour = = = The breed has four recognized colours . Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace , where John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough , raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour . In some dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead : this is called the \" blenheim \" spot . The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the \" Duchess Thumb Print \" , based on the legend that Sarah Churchill , Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband 's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim , pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb , resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won . Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights , particularly eyebrows , cheeks , legs and beneath the tail . Black and Tan is referred to as \" King Charles \" in the King Charles Spaniel . Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over , although some can have some white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules . The fourth colour is known as Tricolour , which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks , inside ears , on eyebrows , inside legs , and on underside of tail . This colour is referred to as \" Prince Charles \" in the King Charles Spaniel . = = = Popularity = = = According to statistics released by The Kennel Club , Cavaliers were the sixth most popular dog in the United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year . Labrador Retrievers were the most popular with 45,079 registrations in that year . Their popularity is on the rise in America ; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular . They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics , being eighth in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul , seventh in Boston , Atlanta and Washington D.C. , and sixth in both New York City and San Francisco . The breed 's popularity has continued to grow , ranking in 18th place in 2013 . In 2009 , the Cavalier was the fourth most popular breed in Australia with 3,196 registrations behind only Labrador Retrievers , German Shepherd Dogs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers . In addition , there are also national breed clubs in Belgium , Canada , Czech Republic , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , South Africa , Spain and Sweden . = = Temperament = = The breed is highly affectionate , playful , extremely patient and eager to please . As such , dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs . Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs . They will adapt quickly to almost any environment , family , and location and suit city and country life . Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained . Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren 's The Intelligence of Dogs , being of average intelligence in working or obedience . Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful , but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap , making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly . Cavaliers are active and sporting . Cavaliers are successful in conformation shows , obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet , gentle natures . The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise , happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks . They have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets , and so most Cavaliers will never become \" street-wise \" . As they tend to regard all strangers as friends , members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs . Spaniels have a strong hunting instinct and may endanger birds and small animals . However , owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including hamsters and gerbils . The Cavaliers coat requires weekly brushing , but no trimming . However , some owners prefer to trim their Cavaliers long feathers and slippers which can become very dirty when walking or playing outside . = = Health = = Cavaliers can notably suffer from mitral valve disease , which leads to heart failure . This appears in many Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death . Some serious genetic health problems , including early-onset mitral valve disease ( MVD ) , the potentially severely painful syringomyelia ( SM ) , hip dysplasia , luxating patellas , and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed . As today 's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs , any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations . This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed . The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease , luxating patella , and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia . Cavaliers are also affected by ear problems , a common health problem among spaniels of various types , and they can suffer from such other general maladies as hip dysplasia , which are common across many types of dog breeds . = = = Mitral valve disease = = = Nearly all Cavaliers eventually suffer from disease of the mitral valve , with heart murmurs which may progressively worsen , leading to heart failure . This condition is polygenic ( affected by multiple genes ) , and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible . It is the leading cause of death in the breed . A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8 % of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related . The next most common causes are cancer ( 12.3 % ) and old age ( 12.2 % ) . The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5 . It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur . While heart disease is common in dogs generally \u2013 one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems \u2013 mitral valve disease is generally ( as in humans ) a disease of old age . The \" hinge \" on the heart 's mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate , along with the valve 's flaps , causing a heart murmur ( as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats ) then congestive heart failure . The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease , which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age . Veterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve disease in the breed , but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines . The chairperson of the UK CKCS Club said in 2009 : \" There are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock , and of those who do , it would appear that many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals . \" The MVD breeding protocol recommends that parents should be at least 2.5 years old and heart clear , and their parents ( i.e. , the puppy 's grandparents ) should be heart clear until age 5 . = = = Syringomyelia = = = Syringomyelia ( SM ) is a condition affecting the brain and spine , causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis . It is caused by a malformation in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain , compressing it and often forcing it out ( herniating it ) through the opening into the spinal cord . This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid 's pressure , creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets , or syrinxes ( hence the term syringomyelia ) , in the spinal cord . Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel , with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90 % of cavaliers have the malformation , and that between 30 \u2013 70 % have syrinxes . However , most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic . Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age , they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85 % of symptomatic dogs , according to Clare Rusbridge , a research scientist . Symptoms include sensitivity around the head , neck , or shoulders , often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder . Scratching is often unilateral \u2013 restricted to one side of the body . Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ( \" air scratching \" ) . The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking \u2013 without stopping \u2013 in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ( \" bunny hopping \" ) . Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar , is being walked on leash , or is excited , and first thing in the morning or at night . Not all dogs with SM show scratching behavior . Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to suffer pain , though several leading researchers , including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US , believe scratching in SM cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine . If onset is at an early age , a first sign may be scratching and / or rapidly appearing scoliosis . If the problem is severe , there is likely to be poor proprioception ( awareness of body position ) , especially with regard to the forelimbs . Clumsiness and falling results from this problem . Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition . A veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as ear mites , fleas , and allergies , and then , primary secretory otitis media ( PSOM \u2013 glue ear ) , as well as spinal or limb injuries , before assuming that a Cavalier has SM . PSOM can present similar symptoms but is much easier and cheaper to treat . Episodic Falling Syndrome can also present similar symptoms . An MRI scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of SM ( and also will reveal PSOM ) . If a veterinarian suspects SM he or she will recommend an MRI scan . Neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade . = = = Episodic Falling ( EF ) = = = Episodic Falling causes \" exercise-induced paroxysmal hypertonicity \" meaning that there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax . Previously thought to be a muscular disorder , it is now known to be neurological ; recently it has been discovered to be caused by a single recessive gene and a genetic test is available . Except for severe cases , episodes will be in response to exercise , excitement or similar exertions . Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy , which typically results in loss of consciousness , the dog remains conscious throughout the episode . Severity of symptoms can range from mild , occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours . Episodes can become more or less severe as the dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to the attacks . The onset of symptoms usually occurs before five months but can appear at any age . It is similar to Scotty Cramp , a genetic disorder in Scottish Terriers . About 1 % of Cavaliers are affected by the condition , with 19 % being carriers . Dogs with whole coloured coats were more likely to be affected than dogs with parti-coloured coats . = = = Thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytopenia = = = As many as half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may have a congenital blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia , an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood , according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States . Platelets , or thrombocytes , are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting . Excessively low numbers are the most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs . The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized , or macrothrombocytes . Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs . These large platelets function normally , and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets . = = = Hip and knee disorders = = = Hip dysplasia ( HD ) is a common genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels . It is not present at birth but develops with age . Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays , but it is not usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature . Even in adult spaniels with severe HD , X-rays may not always indicate the disease . In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals , the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds . The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog , Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux . Cavaliers can be subject to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella . This condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old . In the most serious cases , surgery may be indicated . The grading system for the patella runs from 1 ( a tight knee ) , to 4 ( a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced ) . If a cavalier has a grade 1 \u2013 2 , physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery . The grades 3 \u2013 4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb . = = = Eye problems = = = A disorder commonly found in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca , colloquially known as \" dry eye \" . The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog 's lacrimal gland ( tear gland ) , reducing the production of tears . According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database , the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness . This disorder can decrease or heal over time . A 1999 study of Cavaliers conducted by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30 % of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems . They include hereditary cataracts , corneal dystrophy , distichiasis , entropion , microphthalmia , progressive retinal atrophy , and retinal dysplasia . = = = Ear disorders = = = Primary Secretory Otitis Media ( PSOM ) , also known as glue ear , consists of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog 's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge . PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers , and it may affect over half of them . Because the pain and other sensations in the head and neck areas , resulting from PSOM , are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia ( SM ) , some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM . Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness , which is present at birth , due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear , although this is relatively rare . In addition , more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss , which usually begins during puppyhood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf , usually between the ages of three and five years . The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors . = = Urban myth = = An urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK , overriding \" no dog except guide dogs \" rules . A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament . This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . The UK Parliament website states : \" Contrary to popular rumour , there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster . We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it . \" Similarly , there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK . A spokesman for the Kennel Club said : \" This law has been quoted from time to time . It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn 't tracked it down . \"",

                    "text": "Culture of the Song dynasty = The Song dynasty ( 960 \u2013 1279 AD ) was a culturally rich and sophisticated age for China . There was blossoming of and advancements in the visual arts , music , literature , and philosophy . Officials of the ruling bureaucracy , who underwent a strict and extensive examination process , reached new heights of education in Chinese society , while general Chinese culture was enhanced by widespread printing , growing literacy , and various arts . Appreciation of art among the gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty , especially in regard to paintings , which is an art practiced by many . Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably shifted from the Northern ( 960 \u2013 1127 ) to Southern Song ( 1127 \u2013 1279 ) periods , influenced in part by the gradual embrace of the Neo-Confucian political ideology at court . People in urban areas enjoyed theatrical drama on stage , restaurants that catered to a variety of regional cooking , lavish clothing and apparel sold in the markets , while both urban and rural people engaged in seasonal festivities and religious holidays . = = Visual arts = = Chinese painting during the Song dynasty reached a new level of sophistication with further development of landscape painting . The shan shui style painting \u2014 \" shan \" meaning mountain , and \" shui \" meaning river \u2014 became prominent features in Chinese landscape art . The emphasis laid upon landscape painting in the Song period was grounded in Chinese philosophy ; Taoism stressed that humans were but tiny specks amongst vast and greater cosmos , while Neo-Confucianist writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena . The making of glazed and translucent porcelain and celadon wares with complex use of enamels was also developed further during the Song period . Longquan celadon wares were particularly popular in the Song period . Black and red lacquerwares of the Song period featured beautifully carved artwork of miniature nature scenes , landscapes , or simple decorative motifs . However , even though intricate bronze-casting , ceramics and lacquerware , jade carving , sculpture , architecture , and the painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem by the Song Chinese , landscape painting was paramount . By the beginning of the Song dynasty a distinctive landscape style had emerged . Artists mastered the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground , while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space . Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds and mist , while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground . There was a significant difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period ( 960 \u2013 1127 ) and Southern Song period ( 1127 \u2013 1279 ) . The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society , hence their paintings often depicted huge , sweeping landscapes . On the other hand , Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale , a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success . Hence , their paintings often focused on smaller , visually closer , and more intimate scenes , while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer . This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy . Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up , not the top down , which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era . Ever since the Southern and Northern Dynasties ( 420 \u2013 589 ) , painting had become an art of high sophistication that was associated with the gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes , the others being calligraphy and poetry . During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings , as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends . The poet and statesman Su Shi ( 1037 \u2013 1101 ) and his accomplice Mi Fu ( 1051 \u2013 1107 ) often partook in these affairs , borrowing art pieces to study and copy , or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed . The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting . Although they were avid art collectors , some Song scholars did not readily appreciate artworks commissioned by those painters found at shops or common marketplaces , and some of the scholars even criticized artists from renowned schools and academies . Anthony J. Barbieri-Low , a Professor of Early Chinese History at the University of California , Santa Barbara , points out that Song scholars ' appreciation of art created by their peers was not extended to those who made a living simply as professional artists : During the Northern Song ( 960 \u2013 1126 CE ) , a new class of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l 'oiel skills of the academy painters nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters . The literati 's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled , yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals , since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression . The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions , who employed a colorful palette , or , worst of all , who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace . They were not to be considered real artists . However , during the Song period , there were many acclaimed court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal family . One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was Zhang Zeduan ( 1085 \u2013 1145 ) , who painted the original Along the River During Qingming Festival scroll , one of the most well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art . Emperor Gaozong of Song ( 1127 \u2013 1162 ) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute , based on the woman poet Cai Wenji ( 177 \u2013 250 AD ) of the earlier Han dynasty . The Southern Song dynasty court painters included Zhao Mengjian ( \u8d99\u5b5f\u5805 , c.1199-1264 ) , a member of the Imperial family , known for popularising the Three Friends of Winter . During the Song period Buddhism saw a small revival since its persecution during the Tang dynasty . This could be seen in the continued construction of sculpture artwork at the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan province . Similar in design to the sculptures at Dazu , the Song temple at Mingshan in Anyue , Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era Buddhist sculptures , including the Buddha and deities clad in lavish imperial and monastic robes . = = = Paintings = = = = = = Ceramics = = = = = Poetry and literature = = Chinese literature during the Song period contained a range of many different genres and was enriched by the social complexity of the period . Although the earlier Tang dynasty is viewed as the zenith era for Chinese poetry ( particularly the shi style poetry of Du Fu , Li Bai , Bai Juyi ) , there were important poetic developments by famous poets of the Song era , with the flourishing of the ci form being especially being associated with Song poetry . Song developments in poetry included the works of the social critic and pioneer of the \" new subjective style \" Mei Yaochen ( 1002 \u2013 1060 ) , the politically controversial yet renowned master Su Shi ( 1037 \u2013 1101 ) , the eccentric yet brilliant Mi Fu ( 1051 \u2013 1107 ) , the premier Chinese female poet Li Qingzhao ( 1084 \u2013 1151 ) , and many others . Although having roots in the Liang dynasty ( 502 \u2013 557 AD ) , and further development during the brief existence of the Southern Tang immediate preceding the Song , the ci form of Chinese poetry found its greatest acceptance and popularity during the Song dynasty , and was used by most Song poets . The high court Chancellor Fan Zhongyan ( 989 \u2013 1052 ) , ardent Neo-Confucian Ouyang Xiu ( 1007 \u2013 1072 ) , the great calligrapher Huang Tingjian ( 1045 \u2013 1105 ) , and the military general Xin Qiji ( 1140 \u2013 1207 ) were especially known for their ci poetry , amongst many others . The great ci poet Li Yu ( who ruled the Southern Tang under the name Li Houzhu ) wrote some of his most famous works during his time as a prisoner at the first Song court , following the demise of his former kingdom : Li Yu is an important transitional figure , sometimes considered to be the first major Song poet , and sometimes acclaimed as the last major Tang poet . Historiography in literature remained prominent during the Song , as it had in previous ages and would in successive ages of China . Along with Song Qi , the essayist and historian Ouyang Xiu were responsible for compiling the New Book of Tang by 1060 , covering the history of the Tang dynasty . Chancellor Sima Guang ( 1019 \u2013 1086 ) , the political nemesis of Wang Anshi ( 1021 \u2013 1086 ) , was responsible for heading a team of scholars that compiled the enormous historical work of the Zizhi Tongjian , a universal history completed in 1084 AD with a total of over 3 million written Chinese characters in 294 volumes . It covered the major themes and intricate nuances of Chinese history from 425 BC during the Warring States all the way up to the 10th century and the fall of the Tang . In 1189 it was compiled and condensed into fifty-nine books by Zhu Xi ( 1130 \u2013 1200 ) , while this project was totally complete with the efforts of his disciples around the time of his death in 1200 . There were also very large encyclopedic works written in the Song period , such as the Four Great Books of Song compiled first by Li Fang in the 10th century and fully edited by the time of Cefu Yuangui in the 11th century . The largest of these was the 1013 publication of the Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau , a massive encyclopedia consisting of 9.4 million written Chinese characters divided into 1000 volumes . There were are also rhyme dictionaries written during the Song dynasty , such as the Jiyun of 1037 . Although Neo-Confucianism became dominant over Buddhism in China during this period , there was still a significant amount of Buddhist literature . For example , there was the collection of Zen Buddhist k\u014dans in the Blue Cliff Record of 1125 , which was expanded by Yuanwu Keqin ( 1063 \u2013 1135 ) . ' Travel record literature ' ( ' youji wenxue ' ) was also a popular category of literature during the Song period , which was accounts of one 's own travel experiences typically written in narrative or prose styles , and included authors such as Fan Chengda ( 1126 \u2013 1193 ) . A great example of Chinese travel literature in the Song period would be Su Shi 's ( 1037 \u2013 1101 ) Record of Stone Bell Mountain . There were many technical and scientific writings during the Song period . The two most eminent authors of the scientific and technical fields were Shen Kuo ( 1031 \u2013 1095 ) and his contemporary Su Song ( 1020 \u2013 1101 ) . Shen Kuo published his Dream Pool Essays in 1088 AD , an enormous encyclopedic book that covered a wide range of subjects , including literature , art , military strategy , mathematics , astronomy , meteorology , geology , geography , metallurgy , engineering , hydraulics , architecture , zoology , botany , agronomy , medicine , anthropology , archeology , and more . As for Shen Kuo 's equally brilliant peer , Su Song created a celestial atlas of five different star maps , wrote the 1070 AD pharmaceutical treatise of the Ben Cao Tu Jing ( Illustrated Pharmacopoeia ) , which had the related subjects of botany , zoology , metallurgy , and mineralogy , and wrote his famous horological treatise of the Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao in 1092 AD , which described in full detail his ingenious astronomical clock tower constructed in the capital city of Kaifeng . Although these two figures were perhaps the greatest technical authors in their field during the time , there were many others . For producing textiles , Qin Guan 's book of 1090 AD , the Can Shu ( Book of Sericulture ) , included description of a silk-reeling machine that incorporated the earliest known use of the mechanical belt drive in order to function . In the literary field of agronomy , there was the Jiu Huang Huo Min Shu ( The Rescue of the People ; a Treatise on Famine Prevention and Relief ) edited by Dong Wei in the 12th century , the Cha Lu ( Record of Tea ) written by Cai Xiang in 1060 AD , the Zhu Zi Cang Fa ( Master Zhu on Managing Communal Granaries ) written by Zhu Xi in 1182 AD , and many others . There were also great authors of written works pertaining to geography and cartography during the Song , such as Yue Shi ( his book in 983 ) , Wang Zhu ( in 1051 ) , Li Dechu ( in 1080 ) , Chen Kunchen ( in 1111 ) , Ouyang Wen ( in 1117 ) , and Zhu Mu ( in 1240 ) . Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century , the matured form known as \" treatise on a place \" , or fangzhi , replaced the old \" map guide \" , or tujing , under the Song . The major differences between the two were that fangzhi were products of local initiative and decision-making , were typically ten to fifty chapters in length , and were almost always printed for a large audience , whereas tujing were products of infrequent demands from the central government and were typically only four chapters long . The widespread availability of printing in the Song allowed many ordinary people to access materials that were once read almost exclusively by experts , such as printed texts and handbooks on agriculture , childbirth , pharmacy and medicine , domestic economics , geography , divination , and Taoist rituals . = = Performing arts = = Theatre and drama in China trace their roots back to the academy of music known as the Pear Garden , founded in the early 8th century during the Tang dynasty . However , historian Stephen H. West asserts that the Northern Song era capital Kaifeng was the first real center where the performing arts became \" an industry , a conglomerate involving theatre , gambling , prostitution , and food . \" The rise in consumption by merchants and scholar-officials , he states , \" accelerated the growth of both the performance and the food industries , \" asserting a direct link between the two due to their close proximity within the cities . Of the fifty some theatres located in the ' pleasure districts ' of Kaifeng , four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each , drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon . The chief crowd that gathered was composed of those from the merchant class , while government officials only went to restaurants and attended theatre performances during holidays . From Kaifeng , the zaju dramatic style employed the beiqu style of poetic lyrics . After the capital had shifted to Hangzhou , the dramatic style of xiwen ( also nanxi or nanqu ) developed separately . These two different regional genres of musical drama used different regional dialects of speech , recitation , and dialogue , entailed their own unique sets of role types ( juese ) , and employed different types of musical instruments playing different tunes . In Kaifeng drama , one singer was preferred for each play , accompanied by string and percussion instruments . In Hangzhou drama , there was a multitude of singers on stage for each set , while string and wind instruments were preferred . Color and clothing distinguished the rank of theatre actors in the Song . Similar to vendors who wore specific outfits to identify which guild they belonged to , actors ' generic costumes reflected the role type they played on stage , whether it be student , young man , young woman , official , soldier , etc . Actors honed their theatrical skills at drama schools . Musicians also found work in the theatre industry , since plays performed in the markets were often accompanied by music . Actors on stage always spoke their lines in Classical Chinese ; vernacular Chinese that imitated the common spoken language was not introduced into theatrical performances until the Yuan dynasty . Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language , acting troupes commonly drew their membership from one of the lowest classes in society : prostitutes . Themes enjoyed in stage skits varied from satires about corrupt officials to comedy acts with titles like \" Setting fire when delivering the soup , \" \" Raising a ruckus in the winehouse , \" \" The peony smells best when the wine is stolen , \" and \" Catching a monkey in a restaurant . \" The only xiwen play to have survived from the Southern Song era is the Zhang Xie zhuang yuan ( \u5f20\u5354\u72c0\u5143 ) , featuring interludes such as a clown stealing food and wine at a wedding banquet in act 16 and a quick comedy sketch about renting a room in act 24 . Surprisingly , actors on stage did not have a wholesale monopoly on theatrical entertainment , as even vendors and peddlers in the street , singing lewd songs and beating on whatever they could find to compensate for percussion instruments , could draw crowds . This practice was so widespread that West claims \" the city itself was turned into a stage and the citizens into the essential audience . \" Many of the songs played for stage performances were tunes that originated from vendors ' and peddlers ' songs . Contests were held on New Year 's Day to determine which vendor or peddler had the best chants and songs while selling wares ; the winners were brought before the imperial court to perform . The Wulin jiushi of the Southern Song states that these vendors , when presented to the consorts and concubines of the palace , were lavished with heaps of gold and pearls for their wares ; some vendors would \" become rich in a single evening . \" Theatrical stunts were also performed to gain attention , such as fried-glutinous-rice-ball vendors hanging small red lamps on portable bamboo racks who would twirl them around to the beat of a drum to dazzle crowds . Puppet shows in the streets and wards were also popular . = = Festivities = = In ancient China there were many domestic and public pleasures in the rich urban environment unique to the Song dynasty . For the austere and hardworking peasantry , annual festivals and holidays provided a time of joy and relaxation , and for the poorest it meant a chance to borrow food and alcoholic drink so that everyone could join in the celebration . People would gather around their local sanctuary to observe the festival 's games , theatrical entertainments , juggling , clowning , and other performances . The festivities on New Years were considered the most important of the year by the Chinese , its momentous occasion correlating with the beginning of February on the Western calendar . Preparations for the New Years festival took place over a month 's time , as people busied themselves painting door gods , crafting paper streamers with lucky characters for \" welcoming the spring , \" making printed images of Zhong Kui , and cooking special kinds of foods such as porridge of red haricot beans . The widely popular Lantern Festival was held every 15th day of 1st lunar month . According to the literatus and official Zhou Mi ( 1232 \u2013 1298 AD ) , during the Xiao-Zong period ( 1163 \u2013 1189 AD ) the best lantern festivals were held at Suzhou and Fuzhou , while Hangzhou was also known for the its great variety of colorful paper lanterns , in all shapes and sizes . Meng Yuanlao ( active 1126 \u2013 1147 ) recalled in Dongjing Meng Hua Lu ( Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital ) how the earlier Northern Song capital at Kaifeng would host festivals with tens of thousands of colorful and brightly lit paper lanterns hoisted on long poles up and down the main street , the poles also wrapped in colorful silk with numerous dramatic paper figures flying in the wind like fairies . There were also other venerated holidays , such as the Qingming Festival , as it was supposedly this period of the year that was depicted in the artwork ( mentioned above ) by the artist Zhang Zeduan ( although some would argue the painting actually represented the time of autumn in the year ) . With the advent of the discovery of gunpowder in China , lavish fireworks displays could also be held during festivities . For example , the martial demonstration in 1110 AD to entertain the court of Emperor Huizong , when it was recorded that a large fireworks display was held alongside Chinese dancers in strange costumes moving through clouds of colored smoke in their performance . The common people also purchased firecrackers from city shopkeepers and vendors , made of simple sticks of bamboo filled with a small amount of gunpowder . Although they were discontinued after the devastation of the Anshi Rebellion ( 755 \u2013 763 ) during the Tang dynasty , lavish Chinese carnivals were revived and once again celebrated during the Song dynasty . Chinese carnival celebrations were held nationwide when the emperor felt a great occasion warranted a grand display of his benevolence and generosity , such as renowned military victories , abundant harvests after long droughts or famines , the granting of grand amnesties by the throne , sacrifices to deities , the installation of a crown prince , marriages within the imperial family , etc . = = Clothing and apparel = = There were many types of clothing and different clothing trends in the Song period , yet clothes in China were always modeled after the seasons and as outward symbols of one 's social class . Coal used for heating one 's home was scarce and often expensive , so people often wore clothing with extra silk-floss and fur-lined coats in the winter . The clothing material preferred by the rich was silk , and for special occasions they had silk robes with gold brocade . The clothing material used by the poor was often hempen cloth , but cotton clothes were also used , the latter being most widely available in the south . The types of clothes worn by peasants and commoners were largely uniform in appearance ( with color standard of black and white ) , and so was the case for the upper class and elite . In fact , wealthy and leading members of society followed accepted guidelines and ritual requirements for clothing . In the upper class , each stratified grade in the social hierarchy was distinguished by the color and specific ornamentation of robes , the shape and type of headgear , and even the style of girdle worn . This rigid order was especially so during the beginning of the dynasty . However , the lines of hierarchy slowly began to blur as the color purple , once reserved solely for the attire of third rank officials or higher , began to diffuse amongst all ranks of officials who bore the color indiscriminately . Along with lower grade civil officials in the government protesting the rigid regulations for attire , the wealthy members of the merchant class also contributed to the disintegration of rules for ceremonial attire worn only by certain members of society . Yet there were still visible distinctions between civil officials and the class of rich merchants and business owners ; the officials were distinguished by their long robes reaching to the ground , while merchants often wore a blouse that came down below the waist with trousers . Pants and trousers were introduced to China during the Warring States in the 4th century BC , and were not exclusive to merchants ; every soldier wore trousers as part of his uniform , while trousers were also worn by the common people . Although most men were cleanshaven , soldiers , military officers , and professional boxing champions preferred side-whiskers and goatee beards , as they were a sign of virility . The attire of Song women was distinguished from men 's clothing by being fastened on the left , not on the right . Women wore long dresses or blouses that came down almost to the knee . They also wore skirts and jackets with short or long sleeves . When strolling about outside and along the road , women of wealthy means chose to wear square purple scarves around their shoulders . Ladies also wore hairpins and combs in their hair , while princesses , imperial concubines , and the wives of officials and wealthy merchants wore head ornaments of gold and silver that were shaped in the form of phoenixes and flowers . People in the Song dynasty never left their homes barefoot , and always had some sort of headgear on . Shops in the city specialized in certain types of hats and headgear , including caps with pointed tails , as well as belts and waistwraps . Only Buddhist monks shaved their heads and strolled about with no headgear or hat of any sort to cover their heads . For footwear , people could purchase leather shoes called ' oiled footwear ' , wooden sandals , hempen sandals , and the more expensive satin slippers . = = Food and cuisine = = From the Song period , works such as Dongjing Meng Hua Lu ( Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital ) preserve lists of names for entr\u00e9es and food dishes in customer menus for restaurants and taverns , as well as for feasts at banquets , festivals and carnivals , and modest dining . Many of the peculiar names for these dishes do not provide clues as to what types of food ingredients were used . However , judging from the listed seasonings they used for these dishes , such as pepper , ginger , soya sauce , oil , salt , and vinegar , Song era cuisine is perhaps not too different from the Chinese cuisine of today . Other additional seasonings and ingredients included walnuts , turnips , crushed Chinese cardamon kernels , fagara , olives , ginkgo nuts , citrus zest , and sesame oil . Regional differences in culture brought about different types of foods , while in certain areas the cooking traditions of regional cultures blended together ; such was the case of the Southern Song capital at Hangzhou . After the mass exodus from the north , people brought Henan-style cooking and foods ( popular in the previous Northern Song capital at Kaifeng ) to Hangzhou , which was blended with the cooking traditions of Zhejiang . However , records indicate that already in the Northern Song period , the first capital at Kaifeng sported restaurants that served southern Chinese cuisine . This catered to capital officials whose native provinces were in the southeast , and would have found northern cuisine lacking in sufficient seasoning for their tastes . In fact , texts from the Song era provide the first use of the phrases nanshi , beishi , and chuanfan to refer specifically to northern , southern , and Sichuan cooking , respectively . Many restaurants were known for their specialties ; for example , there was one restaurant in Hangzhou that served only iced foods , while some restaurants catered to those who wanted either hot , warm , room temperature , or cold foods . Descendants of those from Kaifeng owned most of the restaurants found in Hangzhou , but many other regional varieties in foodstuffs and cooking were sponsored by restaurants . This included restaurants catering Sichuan cuisine that emphasized use of pepper , dishes and beverages from Hebei and Shandong , and coastal foods of shrimp and saltwater fish . The memory and patience of waiters had to be keen ; in the larger restaurants , serving dinner parties that required twenty or so dishes became a hassle if even a slight error occurred . If a guest reported the mistake of a waiter to the head of the restaurant , the waiter could be verbally reprimanded , have his salary docked , or in extreme cases , kicked out of the establishment for good . In the early morning in Hangzhou , along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way , special breakfast items and delicacies were sold . This included fried tripe , pieces of mutton or goose , soups of various kinds , hot pancakes , steamed pancakes , and iced cakes . Noodle shops were also popular , and remained open all day and night along the Imperial Way . According to one Song source on Kaifeng , the night markets closed at the third night watch but reopened on the fifth , while they had also gained a reputation for staying open during winter storms and the darkest , rainiest days of winter . There were also some exotic foreign foods imported to China from abroad , including raisins , dates , Persian jujubes , and grape wine ; rice wine was more common in China , a fact noted even by the 13th century Venetian traveler Marco Polo . Although grape-based wine had been known in China since the ancient Han dynasty Chinese ventured into Hellenistic Central Asia , grape-wine was often reserved for the elite . Besides wine , other beverages included pear juice , lychee fruit juice , honey and ginger drinks , tea , and pawpaw juice . Dairy products and farming were foreign concepts to the Chinese , which explains the absence of cheese and milk in their diet . Beef was also rarely eaten , since the bull was an important draft animal . The main diet of the lower classes remained rice , pork , and salted fish , while it is known from restaurant dinner menus that the upper classes did not eat dog meat . The rich are known to have consumed an array of different meats , such as chicken , shellfish , fallow deer , hares , partridge , pheasant , francolin , quail , fox , badger , clam , crab , and many others . Local freshwater fish from the nearby lake and river were also caught and brought to market , while the West Lake provided geese and duck as well . Common fruits that were consumed included melons , pomegranates , lychees , longans , golden oranges , jujubes , Chinese and Japanese quinces , apricots and pears ; in the region around Hangzhou alone , there were eleven kinds of apricots and eight different kinds of pears that were produced . Specialties and combination dishes in the Song period included scented shellfish cooked in rice-wine , geese with apricots , lotus-seed soup , spicy soup with mussels and fish cooked with plums , sweet soya soup , baked sesame buns stuffed with either sour bean filling or pork tenderloin , mixed vegetable buns , fragrant candied fruit , strips of ginger and fermented beanpaste , jujube-stuffed steamed dumplings , fried chestnuts , salted fermented bean soup , fruit cooked in scented honey , and ' honey crisps ' of kneaded and baked honey , flour , mutton fat and pork lard . Dessert molds of oiled flour and sugared honey were shaped into girls ' faces or statuettes of soldiers with full armor like door guards , and were called \" likeness foods \" ( guoshi ) . = = Philosophy = = Song intellectuals sought answers to all philosophical and political questions in the Confucian Classics . This renewed interest in the Confucian ideals and society of ancient times coincided with the decline of Buddhism , which was then largely regarded as foreign , and as offering few solutions for practical problems . However , Buddhism in this period continued as a cultural underlay to the more accepted Confucianism and even Taoism , both seen as native and pure by conservative Neo-Confucians . The continuing popularity of Buddhism can be seen with strong evidence by achievements in the arts , such as the 100 painting set of the Five Hundred Luohan , completed by Lin Tinggui and Zhou Jichang in 1178 . The conservative Confucian movement could be seen before the likes of Zhu Xi ( 1130 \u2013 1200 ) , with staunch anti-Buddhists such as Ouyang Xiu ( 1007 \u2013 1072 ) . In his written work of the Ben-lun , he wrote of his theory for how Buddhism had so easily penetrated Chinese culture during the earlier Southern and Northern Dynasties period . He argued that Buddhism became widely accepted when China 's traditional institutions were weakened at the time . This was due to many factors , such as foreign Xianbei ruling over the north , and China 's political schism that caused warfare and other ills . Although Emperor Wen of Sui ( r . 581 \u2013 604 ) abolished the Nine Ranks in favor of a Confucian-taught bureaucracy drafted through civil service examinations , he also heavily sponsored the popular ideology of Buddhism to legitimate his rule . Hence , it was given free rein and influence to flourish and dominate Chinese culture during the Sui and Tang periods ; historian Arthur F. Wright describes Confucianism in this period as being reverted to a state of \" stale archaism \" . Ouyang Xiu wrote : \" This curse [ Buddhism ] has overspread the empire for a thousand years , and what can one man in one day do about it ? The people are drunk with it , and it has entered the marrow of their bones ; it is surely not to be overcome by eloquent talk . What , then , is to be done ? In conclusion on how to root out the ' evil ' that was Buddhism , Ouyang Xiu presented a historical example of how it could be uprooted from Chinese culture : Of old , in the time of the Warring States , Yang Zhu and Mo Di were engaged in violent controversy . Mencius deplored this and devoted himself to teaching benevolence and righteousness . His exposition of benevolence and righteoussness won the day , and the teachings of Mo Di and Yang Zhu were extirpated . In Han times the myriad schools of thought all flourished together . Tung Chung-shu deplored this and revived Confucianism . Therefore the Way of Confucius shone forth , and the myriad schools expired . This is the effect of what I have called \" correcting the root cause in order to overcome the evil \" . Although Confucianism was cast in stark contrast to the perceived alien and morally inept Buddhism by those such as Ouyang Xiu , Confucianism nonetheless borrowed ideals of Buddhism to provide for its own revival . From Mahayana Buddhism , the Bodhisattva ideal of ethical universalism with benevolent charity and relief to those in need inspired those such as Fan Zhongyan and Wang Anshi , along with the Song government . In contrast to the earlier heavily Buddhist Tang period , where wealthy and pious Buddhist families and Buddhist temples handled much of the charity and alms to the poor , the Song government took on this ideal role instead , through its various programs of welfare and charity ( refer to Society section ) . In addition , the historian Arthur F. Wright notes this situation during the Song period , with philosophical nativism taking from Buddhism its earlier benevolent role : It is true that Buddhist monks were given official appointments as managers of many of these enterprises , but the initiative came from Neo-Confucian officials . In a sense the Buddhist idea of compassion and many of the measures developed for its practical expression had been appropriated by the Chinese state . Although Buddhism lost its prominence in the elite circles and government sponsorships of Chinese society , this did not mean the disappeance of Buddhism from Chinese culture . Zen Buddhism continued to flourish during the Song period , as Emperor Lizong of Song had the monk Wuzhun Shifan share the Ch\u00e1n ( Zen ) doctrine with the imperial court . Much like the Eastern Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate promoting Roman paganism and Theurgy amongst the leading members of Roman society while pushing Christianity 's influence into the lower classes , so too did Neo-Confucians of the 13th century succeed in driving Buddhism out of the higher echelons of Chinese society . In terms of Buddhist metaphysics , Zhou Dunyi influenced the beliefs and teachings of Northern Song-era Confucian scholars such as Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi ( who were brothers ) , and was a major influence for Zhu Xi , one of the leading architects of Neo-Confucianism . They emphasized moral self-cultivation over service to the ruler of the state ( healing society 's ills from the bottom-up , not the top-down ) , as opposed to statesmen like Fan Zhongyan or Su Shi , who pursued their agenda to advise the ruler to make the best decisions for the common good of all . The Cheng brothers also taught that the workings of nature and metaphysics could be taught through the principle ( li ) and the vital energy ( qi ) . The principle of nature could be moral or physical , such as the principle of marriage being moral , while the principle of trees is physical . Yet for principles to exist and function normally , there would have to be substance as well as vital energy . This allowed Song intellectuals to validate the teachings of Mencius on the innate goodness of human nature , while at the same time providing an explanation for human wrongdoing . In essence , the principle underlying a human being is good and benevolent , but vital energy has the potential to go astray and be corrupted , giving rise to selfish impulses and all other negative human traits . The Song Neo-Confucian philosophers , finding a certain purity in the originality of the ancient classical texts , wrote commentaries on them . The most influential of these philosophers was Zhu Xi , whose synthesis of Confucian thought and Buddhist , Taoist , and other ideas became the official imperial ideology from late Song times to the late 19th century . The basis of his teaching was influenced by the Cheng brothers , but he greatly extended their teachings , forming the core of Neo-Confucianism . This included emphasis on the Four Books : the Analects , Mencius , Doctrine of the Mean , and the Great Learning ( the latter two being chapters in the ancient Book of Rites ) . His viewpoint was that improvement of the world began with improvement of the mind , as outlined in the Great Learning . His approach to Confucianism was shunned by his contemporaries , as his writings were forbidden to be cited by students taking the Imperial Examinations . However , Emperor Lizong of Song found his writing to be intriguing , reversing the policy against him , and making it a requirement for students to study his commentaries on the Four Books .",

                    "text": "Carolina wren = The Carolina wren ( Thryothorus ludovicianus ) is a common species of wren that is a resident in the eastern half of the United States of America , the extreme south of Ontario , Canada , and the extreme northeast of Mexico . Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range . Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests , farm edges and suburban areas . This wren is the state bird of South Carolina . There are seven recognized subspecies across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance . The birds are generally inconspicuous , avoiding the open for extended periods of time . When out in the open , they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary . After finding a mate , pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years . Both sexes give out alarm calls , but only males sing to advertize territory . Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season , but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds , among other species . Some populations have been affected by mercury contamination . = = Taxonomy = = The Carolina wren was first described under the name of Sylvia ludoviciana by John Latham in 1790 . Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot considered all wrens under the genus Troglodytes and called the Carolina wren Troglodytes arundinaceus but placed it subsequently in a separate genus Thryothorus ( initially misspelled Thriothorus ) that he created in 1816 . Thryothorus is of Greek origin from the combination of thryon ( rush , reed ) and thouros ( derivative of verb throskein to leap up , spring , jump at ) which means ' reed jumper ' ; its specific name ludovicianus is a post-classical Latin term for Ludovicus ( derivative from Louis XIV ) that means ' of Louisiana ' that identifies the locality of the specimen collected near New Orleans . There are seven recognized subspecies of the Carolina wren : T. l. ludovicianus ( Latham , 1790 ) \u2013 Southeast Canada ( Southern Ontario , irregularly in Eastern and Southern Quebec ) and the eastern United States ( Southern Wisconsin and New England southward to Texas and northern Florida ) . T. l. miamensis Florida wren ( Ridgway , 1875 ) \u2013 Florida from approximately 30 degrees ( Gainesville ) region southward through the rest of the state . T. l. nesophilus ( Stevenson , 1973 ) \u2013 Dog Island in Northwestern Florida . T. l. burleighi \u2013 Burleigh 's Carolina wren ( Lowery , 1940 ) Offshore islands off of the Mississippi coast : Cat Island , Ship Island ( Mississippi ) , and Horn Island . T. l. lomitensis \u2013 Lomita wren ( Sennett , 1890 ) southern Texas to the extreme northeast of Mexico ( Tamaulipas ) . T. l. berlandieri \u2013 Berlandier 's wren ( S. F. Baird , 1858 ) Northeastern Mexico ( eastern Coahuila , Nuevo Leon , and southwestern Tamaulipas ) T. l. tropicalis \u2013 Northeastern Mexico ( eastern San Luis Potosi and southern Tamaulipas ) . T. ludovicianus is traditionally placed within its own genus as its only representative of North America , but recent DNA work suggests it is closely allied with the Bewick 's wren . A distinct population in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico , Belize , Nicaragua , and in Guatemala is treated as a separate species , either known as Cabot 's wren or white-browed wren ( Thryothorus albinucha ) . It is considered a subspecies of T. ludovicianus by some authors , however . = = Description = = At 12.5 to 14 cm ( 4.9 to 5.5 in ) long , with a 29 cm ( 11 in ) wingspan and a weight of about 18 to 23 g ( 0.63 to 0.81 oz ) , the Carolina wren is a fairly large wren ; the second largest in the United States species after the cactus wren . Among standard measurements , the wing chord is 5.4 to 6.4 cm ( 2.1 to 2.5 in ) , the tail is 4.5 to 5.6 cm ( 1.8 to 2.2 in ) , the culmen is 1.4 to 1.8 cm ( 0.55 to 0.71 in ) and the tarsus is 2 to 2.3 cm ( 0.79 to 0.91 in ) . Sexual dimorphism is slight with males being larger than their mates . A study indicated that out of 42 mated pairs , all but one of male was larger than the female of the pair . The males were on average 11 percent heavier along with having longer wing chords . There are several differences among the subspecies . For T. l. ludovicianus , the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its rump and uppertail-coverts . Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown , with a series of small white dots on the lesser primary coverts . The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs ; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only , but darker and more noticeable . The retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail . The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below , and extends above and beyond its shoulders . The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black . Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest , flank and belly , though the latter two are of a warmer color . The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color . Its iris is reddish-brown , the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and lower mandible . The legs are flesh-colored . As for the other subspecies in contrast to T. l. ludovicianus , T. l. berlandieri is of a slightly smaller build , but possesses a larger bill , the upperparts are duller brown with deeper colored underparts , T. l. lomitensis is of a duller color ( than either ludovicianus or berlandieri ) with its underparts either pale or almost white , T. l. miamensis contains darker rusty chestnut upperparts and deeper colored below . T. l. burleighi is duller and sootier with less distinct tail markings , T. l. mesophilus has paler underparts and a whiter supercilium , and T. l. tropicalis is darker than all races , and contains heavier bars than T. l. berlandieri . = = = Plumage = = = The juvenile T.l. ludovicianus is similar in appearance , but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff-tipped wing coverts , a superciliary streak is less white , a fluffy vent and crissum ( flanks ) without bars . In August and September , the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage , wing coverts , tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe . The post-nuptial molt for adults in the same time period is more pronounced in color than the spring molt , with both sexes similar in appearance . = = = Life span = = = Survival rates differ by region . A male captured in Arkansas lived to be at least 73 months old , and in Alabama , the oldest female and male captured were six and ten years old , respectively . A mark-and-recapture analysis of the wrens analyzing survival probability within the Southeastern United States captured was monitored from 1992 to 2003 . Roughly 90 percent of the banded wrens died within 10 years . = = = Similar species = = = The easiest species to confuse with the Carolina wren is Bewick 's wren , which differs in being smaller but with a longer tail , grayer-brown above and whiter below . The Carolina and white-browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger , with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe ; their culmen has a notch behind the tip . = = Habitat and distribution = = These birds are largely resident , and will only disperse beyond their range after mild winters . Carolina wrens sporadically breed as far north as Maine and Quebec after mild winters . In certain parts of their range , such as most of Iowa , prolonged periods of snow can curtail potential expansion . Permanent breeding locations range from eastern Nebraska , southern Michigan , southeast Ontario and the New England states to Mexican states such as Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , San Luis Potos\u00ed and Tamaulipas and the Gulf Coast of the United States . Local occurrences with infrequent and likely breeding locations include southeast South Dakota , central Kansas , eastern Colorado , western Oklahoma and Texas as far as Maine and New Brunswick . There have been occasional vagrants spotted in Colorado , New Mexico , and Arizona , Wyoming , South Dakota , Manitoba , Nova Scotia , and the Gulf of St. Lawrence . The range of the wrens increased northward and westward in several regions over the past few centuries . In Massachusetts , the wrens had expanded westward and northeastward from its former southeastern location in approximately 35 years , in New York the population increased three-fold in roughly 25 years , while in midwest states such as Ohio and Michigan have seen numbers of the birds increase since the mid-1800s and early 1900s , respectively . Expansion around Ontario occurred since early reports in 1890 and 1905 . Explanations given include infrequent winter storms in the 20th century , expanded forest habitats , and the wrens taking advantage of urban areas containing feeders , especially in winter . Carolina wrens adapt to various habitats . Natural habitats include various types of woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands , ash and elmwoods , hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth . The preferred habitats are riparian forests , brushy edges , swamps , overgrown farmlands , and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees , and parks . It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas . Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos . = = Behavior = = = = = Song and calls = = = Carolina wrens sing year round and at any point during the daytime , with the exception of performing during the most harsh weather conditions . The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size . Males alone sing , and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average , thirty two . One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes , and although the male 's song can be repeated up to twelve times , the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition . While singing , the tail of the birds is pointed downward . Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery . Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel , whee-udel , whee-udel , che-wortel , che-wortel and t\u00fartee-t\u00fartee-t\u00fartee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart , sweet heart , come to me , come to me , sweet William , and Richelieu , Richelieu . Males are capable of increasing their repertoire through song learning , but due to their sedentary nature and territorial defense habits , the song learning must occur within the first three months of life . Geographic barriers affect song repertoire size from male wrens , as one study indicated that distances separated as close as 3 kilometres ( 1.9 mi ) by water barriers can have the same effect as that of a distance of 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) in the mainland with no barriers . Female Carolina wrens possess song control regions that would appear to make them capable of singing with repertoires like the male . Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male , it has been suggested that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance . Different subspecies have variations in songs and calls , such as miamensis having a more rapid song that contains more notes than the races that are further north . Their songs can be confused with the Kentucky warbler . The song patterns are similar , but is of a different quality , as the warbler 's songs is described as richer , with more ringing and a hurried pace . Other bird species that have their songs described as akin to the wrens are the flicker , Baltimore oriole , gray catbird , and more specifically the peto , peto , peto calls of the tufted titmouse , and whistles of the northern cardinal . Occasionally , the wrens mimic other species , and in Pennsylvania it has led for it to be also known as the ' mocking wren ' . = = = Sexual selection = = = A 2006 study suggested that the correlation of tail length and body size in males , wing length in females , and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality , and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals . The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use . Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle . Due to the large size of male wrens and the male 's vigor in defending its territory , intrasexual selection was given as a possible explanation for the sexual dimorphism . = = = Territorial and predator defense = = = Both sexes are involved in defending the territory . One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying the proximity of the threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls . In experiments involving playback , the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs , as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions , and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories , such as songs under foliage . Song degradation can also be used to determine the proximity of potential intruders . If the song of a bird appears to be degraded , the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond ; if the song is not degraded , they respond by attacking . Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies . Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as ' dear-enemies ' by the wrens , and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season . In spring , the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors , though in the fall , no major discrepancy in responses is shown . When protecting their nest , alarm calls are the general response . The wrens judge the size of the potential threat , such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking . Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens . Both males and females utilize calls in alarm situations , especially in territorial disputes and encounters with predators . Males alone produce the cheer call , which can sound indistinct . In southern regions of their range , the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p 'dink sound . Females are the only ones that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds . The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators , and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant . The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song , and the song can either follow or overlap her mate 's song . = = = Feeding = = = Carolina wrens spend the majority of their time on or near the ground searching for food , or in tangles of vegetation and vines . They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels , or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey . Their diet consists of invertebrates , such as beetles , true bugs , grasshoppers , katydids , spiders , ants , bees , and wasps . Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet . Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets , such as fruit pulp and various seeds . In the northern portion of their range , they frequent bird feeders . = = = Movement = = = Carolina wrens are wary , and are more often heard than seen . When on the ground , they move in jerky hops pillaging through various objects , whether man-made or natural . While moving abruptly , they pause momentarily for chattering or singing . When stationary , they move in twitched motions , jerking their breast around . They also sun- or sand-bathe . The wrens also displays a skittish behavior when encountered by humans , as they can be seen thrusting off into cover slowly if approaching is detected . However , they occasionally seek out humans that are near , so long as there is no movement from them . Other movements involve being capable of crawling like a creeper and hanging upside-down like a nuthatch . Flights are generally of short duration , rapid , low-leveled , and wavelike . The wings during flight are flapped rapidly , and are frequently used during foraging . They are also capable of flying vertically from the base of a tree to the top in a single wing assisted bound . = = = Breeding = = = Carolina wrens are both genetically and socially monogamous and will usually mate for life . Mate changing is rare , and there has been one possible instance of polygamy . During the winter season , males are more responsible for guarding the territory . Females vary in succeeding to maintain winter territories without a mate . It has been suggested that the possibility of desertion and decline in care-taking from males along with the need for security in resources year-round prevent extra pair copulations from females , as the mortality rate for Carolina wrens peaks during the winter . Along with thermoregulatory benefits , roosting is thought to reinforce pair-bonding and prevent divorce between mates . The nests are arch-shaped structures with a side entrance and built of dried plants or strips of bark , as well as horsehair , string , wool and snake sloughs . Males obtain nesting materials while the females remains at the site to construct the nest . Nests are located in fragmented or complete cavities in trees , or in man-made structures such as bird-boxes , buildings , tin cans , mailboxes or unorthodox places such as pockets of hanging jackets in sheds or in a tractor in everyday use . Nests are from 1 \u2013 3 m ( 3.3 \u2013 9.8 ft ) from the ground and are rarely higher . They occasionally can be built in sloping locations or at ground level . Egg laying dates and clutch size vary by region ; in Texas the time period is from late February to late August , in Iowa it ranges from late April to June . The clutch size is generally 3 to 6 eggs , but can reach as high as seven in Texas . The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots , and are more heavily marked at the broad end . The eggs are incubated by the female for 12 \u2013 16 days . After the young hatch , they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12 \u2013 14 days . As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season . In one study , three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area . Male and females are involved in the process of provisioning at similar rates throughout most nest stages , with the males providing slightly more in the nestling stages . Both sexes increase their provision rates as the nestlings grow in age . = = Predation and threats = = Brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds is common , with up to 25 % of Carolina wren nests being affected in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama . Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41 % , and is as low as 8 % and 0 % in July and August , respectively . Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own , and even if host eggs are retained , the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs . As a result , cowbirds may have a significant impact on the reproductive success of wrens . The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates , and some have been raised to independence . This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings . A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded . The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations . Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings . Fellow species of wren such as Bewick 's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food , respectively . In Virginia , some Carolina wrens populations show high levels of mercury in their blood and this is acquired from feeding all-year-round on spiders . Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury ( through biomagnification ) than herbivorous invertebrates . As these wrens are year-round residents , they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood . Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content . Exposure , and prolonged periods of cold , ice , and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations , respectively . Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season . Among the top predators of adult Carolina wrens are domestic cats , and snakes such as the canebrake rattlesnake . Raccoons and black rat snakes also feed on wren eggs and nestlings . = = In culture = = In 1930 , the South Carolina Federated Women 's club adopted the Carolina wren as the unofficial state bird over the eastern mourning dove and pushed for its official state adoption until 1939 , when the South Carolina Legislature named the northern mockingbird as the state bird . In 1948 , the legislature repealed their previous decision , and the wren became the official state bird . In 2000 , the Carolina wren was featured on the back of the South Carolina edition of the 50 State Quarters .",

                    "text": "Alligator gar = Alligator gar ( Atractosteus spatula ) are ray-finned euryhaline fish related to bowfin in the infraclass Holostei ( ho ' -las-te-i ) . The fossil record traces their existence to the Early Cretaceous over a hundred million years ago . They are the largest species in the gar family , and among the largest freshwater fishes in North America . Gars are often referred to as \" primitive fishes \" , or \" living fossils \" because they have retained some morphological characters of their earliest ancestors , such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks , and they can breathe both air and water . Their common name was derived from their resemblance to American alligator , particularly their broad snout and long sharp teeth . Anecdotal evidence in several scientific reports suggest that an alligator gar can grow up to 10 ft ( 3.0 m ) in length and weigh as much as 300 lb ( 140 kg ) ; however in 2011 the largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was 8 ft 5 1 \u2044 4 in ( 2.572 m ) long , weighed 327 lb ( 148 kg ) , and was 47 in ( 120 cm ) around the girth . The body of an alligator gar is torpedo shaped , usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface . Their scales are not like the scales of other fishes , rather they have ganoid scales which are hard , enamel-like , diamond-shaped scales , often with serrated edges . Ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable and have served the fish well as protection against predation . Unlike other gar species , the upper jaw of an alligator gar has a dual row of large sharp teeth which are used to impale and hold prey . Alligator gar are stalking , ambush predators , primarily piscivores , but they will also ambush and eat water fowl and small mammals they find floating on the water 's surface . Populations of alligator gar have been extirpated from much of their historic range as a result of habitat destruction , indiscriminate culling , and unrestricted harvests . Populations are now located primarily in the southern portions of the United States extending into Mexico . They are considered euryhaline because they can adapt to varying salinities ranging from freshwater lakes and swamps to brackish marshes , estuaries , and bays along the Gulf of Mexico . For nearly a half-century , alligator gar were considered \" trash fish \" , or a \" nuisance species \" detrimental to sport fisheries ; therefore , were targeted for elimination by state and federal authorities in the United States . The 1980s brought a better understanding of the ecological balance necessary to sustain an ecosystem , and eventually an awareness that alligator gar were no less important than any other living organism in the ecosystems they inhabit . Over time , alligator gar were afforded some protection by state and federal resource agencies . They are also protected under the Lacey Act which makes it illegal to transport certain species of fish in interstate commerce when in violation of state law or regulation . Several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild , and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public . Alligator gar are being cultured in ponds , pools , raceways and tanks by federal hatcheries for mitigation stocking , by universities for research purposes , and in Mexico for consumption . = = Anatomy = = Alligator gar are the largest species in the gar family , and among the largest freshwater fishes found in North America . Mature alligator gar commonly measure 6 ft ( 1.8 m ) in length , and weigh over 100 lbs . ( 45 kg ) . However , anecdotal reports suggest they can grow up to 10 ft ( 3m ) in length , and weigh as much as 350 lbs . ( 159 kg ) . The largest alligator gar officially recorded was inadvertently caught in the net of fisherman Kenny Williams of Vicksburg , Mississippi while he was fishing the oxbow lakes of the Mississippi River on February 14 , 2011 . Williams was pulling up his net on Lake Chotard expecting to find buffalo fish , but instead discovered a large alligator gar tangled in his net . The gar was 8 ft 5 1 \u2044 4 in ( 2.572 m ) long , weighed 327 lb ( 148 kg ) , and its girth was 47 in ( 120 cm ) . According to wildlife officials , the fish was estimated to be somewhere between 50 and 70 years old ; one report estimated the gar 's age to be at least 95 . Williams donated it to the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson where it will remain on display . All gars have torpedo-shaped bodies , but some distinguishing characteristics of adult alligator gar include their large size , heavy bodies , broad heads , short broad snouts , large sharp teeth and double row of teeth on their upper jaw . They are usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface . The dorsal and anal fins are positioned toward the back of their bodies , and their caudal fin is abbreviate-heterocercal , or non-symmetrical . = = Physiology = = Alligator gar have gills , but unlike other species of fish , with few exceptions , they also have a highly vascularized swim bladder lung that supplements gill respiration . The bladder not only provides buoyancy but also enables them to breathe in air which is why they are able to inhabit bodies of water in which most other fishes would die of suffocation . The swim bladder is connected to their foregut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface , an action that is seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern United States during the hot summer months . The scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales ; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are diamond-shaped and may have a serrated edge . These scales are designed for toughness and strength when under attack , and are composed of a tough inner layer of bone and a hard outer layer of ganoin that is nearly impenetrable . = = Taxonomy and evolution = = Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de first described the alligator gar in 1803 . The original name was Lepisosteus spatula , but was later changed by E.O. Wiley in 1976 to Atractosteus spatula in order to recognize two distinct extant taxon of gars . Synonyms of Atractosteus spatula include Lesisosteus [ sic ] ferox ( Rafinesque 1820 ) , and Lepisosteus spatula ( Lacepede 1803 ) . Fossils from the order Lepisosteiformes have been collected in Europe from the Cretaceous to Oligocene periods , in Africa and India from the Cretaceous , and in North America from the Cretaceous to recent times . Lepisosteidae is the only extant family of gar which has seven species all located in North and Central America . The fossil record traces the existence of alligator gar back to the Early Cretaceous over a hundred million years ago . Despite being a highly evolved species , alligator gar are often referred to as \" primitive fishes \" , or \" living fossils \" because they have retained a few morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors with seemingly little to no apparent changes , such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks , an abbreviate-heterocercal tail , and a swim bladder lung for breathing in both air and water . = = Feeding behavior = = Alligator gar are relatively passive , seemingly sluggish solitary fish , but voracious ambush predators . They are opportunistic night predators and are primarily piscivores , but they will also ambush and eat water fowl and small mammals that may be floating on the surface . Their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface , and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach . They lunge forward , and with a sweeping motion grab their prey , impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth . Diet studies have shown alligator gar to be opportunistic piscivores , and even scavengers depending on the availability of their preferred food source . They occasionally ingest sport fish , but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on forage fishes such as gizzard shad as well as invertebrates , and water fowl . Diet studies have also revealed fishing tackle and boat engine parts in their stomachs . = = Spawning = = As with most ancestral species , alligator gar are long living , and sexually late maturing . Most females do not reach sexual maturity until after their first decade of life while males reach sexual maturity in half that time . The conditions must be precise for a successful spawning to occur . Preparation for spawning begins in the spring with the extended photoperiod and rising water temperatures , but flooding is also necessary to trigger the event . When rivers rise and spread over the floodplain , they create oxbow lakes and sloughs , and inundate terrestrial vegetation which in turn provides protection and a nutrient rich habitat for larval fishes , and fry . Once the water temperature has reached 68 to 82 \u00b0 F ( 20 to 28 \u00b0 C ) , and all the other criteria are met , gars will move into the grassy , weed-laden shallows to spawn . Actual spawning occurs when a collection of males gather around gravid females , and begin writhing , twisting , bumping into and slithering over the tops of females , an activity which triggers the release of eggs . Males release clouds of milt to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column . The sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation , and development begins . It takes only a few days for the eggs to hatch into larval fish , and another ten days or so for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry . Egg production is variable , and believed to be dependent on the size of the female . A common formula used for predicting the volume of eggs a female can produce is 4.1 eggs / gram of body weight which gives an average of about 150,000 eggs per spawn . The eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested . = = Distribution = = = = = Natural range = = = Alligator gar inhabit a wide variety of aquatic habitats , but most are found in the Southern United States in reservoirs and lakes , in the backwaters of lowland rivers , and in the brackish waters of estuaries , bayous and bays . They have occasionally been seen in the Gulf of Mexico . In Texas and Louisiana it is common to see large gars breaking the surface in reservoirs , bayous , and brackish marshes . They are found throughout the lower Mississippi River Valley and Gulf Coast states of the Southern United States and Mexico as far south as Veracruz , encompassing the following states in the United States : Texas , Oklahoma , , Louisiana , Kentucky , Mississippi , Alabama , Tennessee , Arkansas , Missouri , Illinois , Florida , and Georgia . Reports suggest alligator gar were once numerous throughout much of their northern range , however valid sightings today are rare , and may occur once every few years . Records of historical distribution indicate alligator gar once inhabited regions as far north as central Kansas , Nebraska , Ohio , Iowa , and west-central Illinois where they are now listed as extirpated . The most northerly verified catch was in Meredosia , Illinois in 1922 . = = = Outside natural range = = = A few notable sightings of alligator gar have been reported outside North America . In November 2008 , a broadhead gar , genus Atractosteus , measuring 5.2 to 6.4 ft ( 1.6 to 2.0 m ) was caught in the Caspian Sea north of Esenguly , Turkmenistan by two officials of Turkmenistan Fishery Protection . Its species is unconfirmed but is believed to be an alligator gar . On September 4 , 2009 a 3 ft 3 in ( 0.99 m ) alligator gar was found in Tak Wah Park in Tsuen Wan , Hong Kong . Over the next two days , at least 16 other alligator gar , the largest measuring 4.9 ft ( 1.5 m ) , were found in ponds in public parks in Hong Kong . Nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by aquarium hobbyists , and had lived there for several years . However , after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as crocodiles , the use of terms like \" horrible man-eating fish \" had begun appearing in the headlines of some major local newspapers . Officials with Leisure and Cultural Services in Tak Wah Park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large , carnivorous fish might harm children . It is not unusual for the large sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar to precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species . Sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans even though none of the reports have been confirmed . On January 21 , 2011 , an alligator gar measuring 4 feet 11 inches ( 1.50 m ) was caught in a canal in Pasir Ris , Singapore by two recreational fishermen . The fish was taken to a nearby pond where the owner confirmed it was an alligator gar rather than an arapaima as the men had initially thought . There have been anecdotal reports of alligator gar captured in various parts of India but are believed to be the result of incidental releases by aquarium hobbyists and the like . In August 2015 , an alligator gar was found entangled in cloth inside a well in Dadar where it had been living for quite some time . It was rescued by animal activists and returned to the well unharmed . In June 2016 , a 3.5 ft Alligator Gar was caught from Subhash Sarovar Lake in Kolkata . Other incidents over the years have been random , ranging anywhere from captures in coastal waters during environmental assessments to captures in private ponds . = = Human utilization = = = = = Early history = = = Native Americans in the south , and Caribbean peoples used the alligator gar 's ganoid scales for arrow heads , breastplates , and as shielding to cover plows . Early settlers tanned the skins to make a strong , durable leather to cover their wooden plows , make purses , and various other items . Gar oil was also used by the people of Arkansas as a repellent for buffalo-gnats . For nearly half a century , alligator gar were considered \" trash fish \" , or a \" nuisance species \" by state and federal authorities who targeted them for elimination to protect game fish populations , and to prevent alleged attacks on humans , a claim that remains unsubstantiated with the exception of occasional injuries sustained from captured alligator gar thrashing around on the decks of boats . Fishermen participated in the slaughter of thousands of alligator gar believing they were providing a great service . In 1995 , KUHT channel 8 , a member PBS television station located on the campus of the University of Houston in Texas , distributed and broadcast the first video documentary ever produced on alligator gar . The documentary , \" Alligator Gar : Predator or Prey ? \" , debuted nationally in prime time during the July Sweeps , and according to the Nielsen rating report provided to KUHT , was the number one rated program of the evening . The documentary focused on the physiology and life cycle of alligator gar , addressed the destruction of habitat , the unregulated culling and over harvesting of alligator gar from various lakes in Texas and Louisiana , and expressed concerns for the future of the species at a time when they were still considered a \" trash fish \" . A decade passed before any significant action was taken to protect and preserve the remaining populations of alligator gar in the United States . The Missouri Department of Conservation has since partnered with Tennessee , Arkansas , Kentucky , Illinois , Alabama , Mississippi , Texas , Oklahoma , and Louisiana in restoration and management activities . = = = Sport fish = = = The long time public perception of alligator gar as \" trash fish \" , or a \" nuisance species \" has changed with increasing national and international attention on the species as a sport fish which some have attributed to features on popular television shows . Oklahoma , Texas , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana allow regulated sport fishing of alligator gar . Texas has one of the best remaining fisheries for alligator gar , and in concert with its efforts to maintain a viable fishery , imposed a one-per-day bag limit on them in 2009 . The Texas state record , and world record for the largest alligator gar caught on rod and reel is 279 lb ( 127 kg ) , taken by Bill Valverde on January 1 , 1951 on the Rio Grande in Texas . Alligator gar are also quite popular among bowfishers because of their large size , trophy potential , and fighting ability . The Texas state bowfishing record was set In 2001 by Marty McClellan with a 290 pounds ( 130 kg ) alligator gar from the Trinity River . The all-tackle record was a 302 pounds ( 137 kg ) alligator gar caught on a trotline in 1953 by T.C. Pierce , Jr . In 1991 , fishing guide , Kirk Kirkland , anecdotally reported catching an alligator gar measuring 9 feet 6 inches ( 2.90 m ) on rod and line from the Trinity River . = = = Commercialization and aquaculture = = = Declining populations of alligator gar throughout their historic range has resulted in the need to monitor wild populations and regulate commercial harvests . Alligator gar have a high yield of white meat fillets and a small percentage of waste relative to body weight . The meat is sold to wholesale distributors , and also sold retail by a few supermarkets with prices starting at around $ 3.00 / lb . Fried gar balls , grilled fillets , and fillets boiled in water with crab boil seasoning are popular dishes in the south . There is also a small cottage industry that makes jewelry out of ganoid scales , and tans gar hides to produce leather for making lamp shades , purses , and a host of novelty items . Atractosteus gars , including alligator gar , tropical gars , and Cuban gars are considered good candidates for aquaculture particularly in developing regions where their rapid growth , disease resistance , easy adaptation to artificial feeds as juveniles , and ability to tolerate low water quality are essential . Their ability to breathe in both air and water eliminates the need for costly aeration systems and other technology commonly used in aquaculture . In the Southern United States , as well as in parts of Mexico and Cuba , broodstocks have already been established , and are being maintained in their respective regions where they already are a popular food fish . = = = Aquaria = = = Despite the large size alligator gar can attain , they are kept as aquarium fish , though many fish labeled as \" alligator gar \" in the aquarium trade are actually smaller species . Alligator gar require a very large aquarium or pond , and ample resources in order for them to thrive in captivity . They are also a popular fish for public aquaria , and zoos . It is illegal in many areas to keep alligator gar as pets , but they will occasionally show up in fish stores . Alligator gar are highly prized and sought after for private aquaria , particularly in Japan . According to some reports , large alligator gar could fetch as much as US $ 40,000 in what some consider the \" Japanese black market \" . In June 2011 , three men from Florida and Louisiana were indicted on charges of illegally removing wild alligator gar from the Trinity River in Texas , and attempting to ship them to Japan for private collectors . The indictments resulted from an undercover sting operation by special agents with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service , the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department , and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission . The charges included violations of three separate provisions of the Lacey Act , specifically conspiracy to submit a false label for fish transported in interstate commerce ; conspiracy to transport fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation ; and conspiracy to transport and sell fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation . Two of the conspirators entered guilty pleas to one count , and the government dropped the other two charges against them . A third conspirator went to trial on all three counts , was acquitted on one count , and found guilty on two . The district court sentenced him to serve nine months in prison followed by one year of supervised release . The case was appealed , and on April 15 , 2014 , the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the district court .",

                    "text": "1997 Michigan Wolverines football team = The 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1997 NCAA Division I-A football season . In its third year under head coach Lloyd Carr , Michigan compiled a perfect 12 \u2013 0 record , won the Big Ten Conference championship , defeated Washington State in the 1998 Rose Bowl , and was declared the national champion by the Associated Press and numerous other polls . The Nebraska Cornhuskers , who also went undefeated and beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl , captured the top spot in the final Coaches ' Poll . Michigan 's defense was led by cornerback and Heisman Trophy-winner Charles Woodson . Woodson , who intercepted eight passes and also scored touchdowns via pass receptions , runs from scrimmage and punt return , became the first primarily defensive player to win the Heisman . Woodson and defensive end Glen Steele were both first-team selections on the 1997 College Football All-America Team . Other standouts on defense included linebackers James Hall with 8.5 quarterback sacks , Sam Sword with 91 tackles , and Dhani Jones with 90 tackles and six sacks . The defense allowed no fourth quarter points or second half touchdowns in the first eight games of the season . The unit 's performance across all games in total defense ( 222.8 yards per game ) and scoring defense ( 9.5 points per game ) are the lowest marks by any Big Ten Conference football team since the 1985 season . On offense , the 1997 Michigan team had neither a 1000-yard rusher nor a 500-yard receiver . Tai Streets was the leading receiver with 476 receiving yards , and Chris Howard led the team in rushing with 938 rushing yards . Quarterback Brian Griese set Michigan single-season records with 193 pass completions and 307 pass attempts . Tight end Jerame Tuman , who was the only player on the offensive unit selected as a first-team All-American , totaled 437 receiving yards and five touchdowns . Ten members of the team were honored as All-Big Ten Conference selections , and running back Anthony Thomas was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year . Thirty-one members of the 1997 Wolverines football team went on to play in the NFL . Prior to 1997 , the Wolverines had compiled four consecutive four-loss seasons and had not won a national championship since the 1948 Michigan team . = = Schedule = = = = Pre-season = = Pre-season ranking Going into the 1997 season , the Wolverines were ranked No. 17 in the pre-season Coaches ' Poll and had experienced four consecutive four-loss seasons for the first time since the 1934 \u2013 1937 Michigan Wolverines football teams . Michigan had not won a national championship in nearly 50 years and had not played in a Rose Bowl Game since the 1992 season . The 1997 Michigan team was the first since the 1969 team to have no Rose Bowl veterans . In early September 1997 , The Columbus Dispatch wrote off Michigan , noting that \" the longtime beast of the Big Ten ... has lost much of its aura \" and predicting that Michigan 's 1997 schedule \" doesn 't create a feeling that the pendulum is about to swing back . \" Quarterback competition The months before the 1997 season opener featured uncertainty over the quarterback position . Junior Scott Dreisbach had started 11 games for the 1996 team , but fifth-year senior Brian Griese had relieved Driesbach in the Ohio State game after Driesbach was injured and helped the team recover from a 9 \u2013 0 deficit . Dreisbach and Griese also faced competition from sophomore and future Super Bowl MVP , Tom Brady . Shortly before the season opener , head coach Lloyd Carr announced his selection of Griese as the starting quarterback . Receiving corps Despite uncertainty at quarterback , Michigan entered the 1997 season with a solid group of receivers , including Tai Streets and Russell Shaw , as well as returning All-Big Ten tight end Jerame Tuman . Analysts believed that a solid season by any of the Michigan quarterbacks could lead to a productive season in the passing game . Moreover , it was anticipated that Charles Woodson , who was regarded as one of the most versatile athletes in college football , would play on offense . Offensive line The offensive line was another uncertainty for the 1997 team . Three linemen from the 1996 team had been selected in the 1997 NFL Draft : center Rod Payne ( 3rd round , 76th overall ) , offensive guard Damon Denson ( 4th round , 97th overall ) and defensive tackle William Carr ( 7th round , 217th overall ) . As a result , Michigan began the season with only one offensive lineman , offensive tackle Jon Jansen , who had started a game . Jansen , a junior , had 25 consecutive starts entering the season . The offensive line was further weakened when left tackle , Jeff Backus , suffered a ruptured appendix . In spring practice , offensive line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting , searching for talent to fill in on the line . To fill the holes on the offensive line , two defensive linemen , Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to the offensive line . Strength of schedule Adding to the challenges facing the 1997 team , Michigan entered the season with the toughest schedule among the 112 NCAA Division I-A schools based on records from the previous year . Days before the season opener , Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to Mount Everest . Carr noted , \" It 's a little akin to climbing Mount Everest . But Mount Everest has been climbed . And with great preparation and determination , and great attitude , which I think our players have , I can assure you we 're looking forward to it . \" = = Season summary = = = = = Week 1 : Colorado = = = Michigan opened the 1997 season with a home game against Colorado . Three years earlier , Colorado had defeated Michigan in a game nicknamed \" The Miracle at Michigan \" on Kordell Stewart 's 64-yard Hail Mary pass to Michael Westbrook as time ran out .

The loss was Colorado 's worst defeat under head coach Rick Neuheisel , its lowest point total in 101 games , and fewest yards of total offense ( 224 ) in five years .

The game matched the nation 's best defense against the number two offense . Michigan 's defense allowed an average of 206.9 yards per game through the regular season , while Washington State averaged 42.5 points and 502.1 yards a game . Washington State , which featured quarterback Ryan Leaf and a five-wideout offense , had established Pac-10 passing records with 3,637 yards and 33 touchdowns . The game marked Michigan 's first Rose Bowl since 1993 and Washington State 's first since 1931 . Going into the game , Michigan held a 68 \u2013 1 and 53.5 \u2013 8.5 first place vote lead in the AP and Coaches Polls over fellow unbeaten Nebraska , respectively . The national television broadcast of the game featured announcers Bob Griese , the father of Michigan 's quarterback , and Keith Jackson , a Washington State alumnus and former radio and television announcer for the Cougars . In the first quarter , Washington State downed a punt at Michigan 's one-yard-line and forced the Wolverines to punt without a first down . After regaining possession at Michigan 's 47-yard-line , Leaf threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to McKenzie to take a 7 \u2013 0 lead with 3 : 07 remaining in the first quarter . On Washington State 's next possession , Woodson intercepted Leaf in the end zone . Later , Griese found Tai Streets for a 53-yard touchdown pass to tie the game with 7 : 08 left in the first half . Leaf opened the second half with a 99-yard drive for a go-ahead touchdown to take a 13 \u2013 7 lead after the extra point was blocked by James Hall . On the ensuing possession , Griese threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Streets on a play-action pass to take a 14 \u2013 13 lead with 5 : 07 left in the third quarter . After a punt by Washington State , Griese led a 14-play , 77-yard drive that ended with a 23-yard play-action touchdown pass from Griese to Jerame Tuman , giving Michigan a 21 \u2013 13 lead with 11 : 21 remaining in the fourth quarter . In the fourth quarter , Leaf converted a 3rd-and-18 play from his own 12 by connecting with McKenzie for 19 yards . Eventually , Washington State settled for a Rian Lindell 48-yard field goal with 7 : 25 to play to make the score 21 \u2013 16 . Michigan started a drive that included four consecutive third down conversions and consumed most of the clock . The conversions were as follows : a 3rd-and-11 Griese scrambled to the Michigan 29 ; a 3rd-and-7 lateral to Woodson who faked a pass before running eight yards to keep the drive alive ; a 3rd-and-6 13-yard pass to Shaw ; and a 3rd-and-7 pass to Woodson taking the ball to the Washington State 33 . A pooch punt by Jay Feely from field goal formation left Washington on its own seven-yard-line with 29 seconds remaining . Washington State 's final drive began at the Cougars 7-yard-line with 16 seconds left to play . Leaf completed a 46-yard pas to Nian Taylor to move the ball to the Michigan 47 . Washington State drew an illegal formation penalty with nine seconds remaining , but executed a hook and lateral play for 26-yards to the Michigan 26-yard-line , with an eight-yard catch by Love Jefferson and an 18-yard run by Jason Clayton who was tackled by Weathers and Jones . With two seconds to play , the clock was stopped to move the chains . With no timeouts left , Leaf spiked the football , but Dick Burleson , the referee from the Southeastern Conference crew , shook his head as Leaf contested the decision . Michigan 's victory evened the series between the Pac-10 and Big 10 in the Rose Bowl at 26 wins apiece . Michigan totaled 379 yards of offense in the game , slightly less than the 398 yards of offense gained by Washington State . Griese , who was selected as the game 's Most Valuable Player , completed 18 of 30 passes for 251 yards and three touchdowns . Leaf completed 17 of 35 passes for 331 passing yards , the fifth highest total in Rose Bowl history . Washington State running back Michael Black injured his calf muscle and was held to 24 yards on 7 carries , while the team totaled just 67 yards rushing . Streets had 4 receptions for 127 yards . = = = Final rankings = = = Following the Rose Bowl , Michigan needed to wait a few days for the final polls . On January 4 , it was revealed that Nebraska had overtaken Michigan by four points and two first place votes in the coaches poll to earn a split in the major national polls . Nebraska had beaten Tennessee 42 \u2013 17 and totaled 534 yards of total offense , including 409 rushing yards and an Orange Bowl record-setting 206 rushing yards by Ahman Green . Michigan held on to a 51.5 \u2013 18.5 final first place vote lead in the AP Poll , but had a 32 \u2013 30 deficit in the coaches poll . Since the 1968 permanent creation of the final post bowl game AP poll , no winning No. 1 team had lost its lead following a bowl game , but the 1990 Colorado Buffaloes football team had lost the coaches poll to Georgia Tech following a 10 \u2013 9 1991 Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame . In addition to bowl game victory margins , Tom Osborne 's retirement and the Big Ten 's cumulative 2 \u2013 5 bowl game record were considered factors leading to the split polls . Michigan was named as the national champion by the following polls : Associated Press , Football News , Football Writers Association of America , National Championship Foundation , National Football Foundation , and Sporting News . = = Statistical achievements = = Michigan 's 1997 defense set the NCAA Division I FBS record for fewest yards allowed per pass completion ( 8.8 yards per completion , 100 \u2013 149 completions ) Over the course of the 1997 season , including conference and non-conference games , Michigan 's defense led the Big Ten Conference in most statistical categories , including rushing defense ( 89.0 yards per game ) , passing defense ( 133.8 yards per game ) , passing defense efficiency ( 81.8 points per game ) , total defense ( 222.8 yards per game ) and scoring defense ( 9.5 points per game ) . Michigan 's 1997 season totals in total defense and scoring defense are the lowest marks among all Big Ten football teams since the 1985 season . The last Big Ten team with a lower scoring defense mark was the 1985 Michigan team that held opponents to 6.8 points per game . Including the 1997 season , Michigan won the Big Ten statistical championship in rushing defense six times in eight years from 1990 to 1997 . On offense , quarterback Brian Griese set Michigan single-season passing records with 193 pass completions and 307 pass attempts .

                    "text": "Honey ( Mariah Carey song ) = \" Honey \" is a hit song by American singer Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album , Butterfly . It was released as the lead single from the album on August 26 , 1997 . The song was written and produced by Carey , Puff Daddy , Q-Tip and Stevie J. It samples \" Hey DJ \" by the World 's Famous Supreme Team , and \" The Body Rock \" by the Treacherous Three . \" Honey \" was a re-defining song in Carey 's career , pushing her further into the hip-hop music world . The song was acclaimed by music critics , who called Carey 's musical transition \" genuine . \" \" Honey \" was successful in the United States , becoming Carey 's third single to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 , a feat that has yet to be duplicated . The song stayed at number one for three weeks . \" Honey \" also reached number one in Canada , and hit the top ten in Australia , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , and the United Kingdom . \" Honey \" was nominated in two categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards , for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance and Best R & B Song . Carey included the song in the set-list of various live shows and future tours , where she would sing both the original and remix versions . \" Honey \" is well known for its accompanying music video , which presented a more sexual and less conservative image of Carey than had been previously seen . The video features Carey being held hostage in a mansion , which she escapes in a James Bond-themed plot . Subsequent scenes see Carey escaping her assailants on a watercraft , dancing aboard a ship with sailors , and frolicking on a beautiful island with her lover . The video garnered much coverage , as many comparisons were made between the video and the rumors of Carey 's failing marriage . While Carey denied the comparisons were anything more than coincidence , many close friends including Walter Afanasieff , Carey 's writing partner , felt they were more than obvious . = = Background and recording = = After the success of her urban crossover album Daydream , Carey began exerting more control over the creative aspects of her career . In doing so , she began pursuing a more hip-hop oriented sound , something very different from anything she had recorded previously . However , she was still writing ballads with Afanasieff , but began looking for more hip-hop / R & B producers to helm part of her new project . The song was recorded in February 1997 . After Carey began working on the song with Q-Tip , they brought the lyrics , samples and melody over to Puff Daddy , who as a producer , had just earned his second number one single on the Hot 100 with \" Mo Money Mo Problems . \" Due to rumors of Puffy 's overbearing nature , Carey recorded her vocals separately , until she gave him a few demos to choose from . Puffy explained why Carey recorded her vocals separately , and his feelings regarding having worked with her : A lot of people feel I 'm overbearing , so I wasn 't allowed in the studio when she did her vocals . I 'm trying to work on that , I 'm such a perfectionist , sometimes I don 't give people the chance to breathe . So I 've been banned from a lot of studios . Mariah [ recorded \" Honey \" ] until she thought it was perfect , like a hundred times . She gave me like a hundred tracks to choose from . Puffy expressed his respect for Mariah and her craft , mentioning that she re-did her vocals many times until she felt they were perfect . After they had the vocals , Carey and Puffy began working on the song 's hook and incorporating the music samples and blending them into the bridge and chorus . After the song was completed , Combs was very confident with the song , calling it \" slammin ' , \" but because of its heavy hip-hop influence , he felt only cautiously optimistic about the song 's commercial success . On a more personal note , \" Honey \" served as Carey 's first single after her separation from estranged husband , Tommy Mottola , who also lead her current record label , Columbia . = = Composition = = \" Honey \" is an up-tempo song , that blends hip hop and contemporary R & B genres . The song is set in the signature common time , and is written in the key of E \u266d major . It features a basic chord progression of A \u266d -F \u266d -1 . Carey 's vocal range in the song spans from the note of C3 to the high note of B \u266d 5 ; with the piano and guitar pieces range from G \u266d 3 to G \u266d 5 . The song 's remix featured rap leads from The Lox and Mase , with some vocals rapped by Combs himself . The track was very different from anything Carey had ever recorded , and was described as \" street Hip-Hop music , with a booming bass . \" The song 's melody was driven by Q-Tip 's drum programming and Stevie J 's keyboard notes . Combs 's production gave the song a \" light and airy \" effect , further distancing it from Carey 's contemporary sound . \" Honey \" featured musical samples from Treacherous Three 's \" The Body Rock , \" and \" Hey DJ \" from the World 's Famous Supreme Team . The track united hip-hop and R & B with traces of pop music and was described as a \" [ song with a ] catchy chorus , combining hip-hop and R & B into something that simply wasn 't going to be denied by anyone , and offering a powerful start to a record . \" According to author Chris Nickson , \" Honey \" revealed a more confident and independent side to Carey that had never been presented in her previous work . The song truly embodied a more mature and confident woman , with sultrier lyrics and a thumping hip-hop beat to accompany it . = = Critical reception = = \" Honey \" garnered acclaimed response from contemporary music critics . David Browne from Entertainment Weekly described the importance the song held for Carey 's musical transition . He wrote \" You 're prepared for a song on which Carey finally breaks free of her adult-contemporary chains and gets down . \" He felt \" Honey \" sounded as \" anyone striking out on his or her own \u2014 caught between old and new habits and taking cautious baby steps into the future . \" Browne also commented that Carey showed a commendable vocal restraint in the song , \" showing some admirable restraint , she nestles herself into the downy-soft beats of \" Honey . \" Author Chris Nickson felt the single 's importance was \" well beyond its chart placing \" and that the single was one of the most important songs in Carey 's career , enabling her to transition into R & B and hip-hop . Nickson commented that before , Carey was seen as a pop singer with R & B tendencies , but \" Honey \" changed that idea , giving the singer \" hip-hop credibility \" , and forced naysayers to \" take another look . \" Rich Juzwiak from Slant complimented the song , calling it \" awakening , both sensually and musically . \" Juzwiak concluded the review writing \" Honey exemplifies the abrupt gear shifting that appreciating Mariah the artist requires . Its new pop brilliance doesn 't always come easy , where detecting it depends on the audience 's newfound ability to apply Carey 's pop life to her pop music . \" \" Honey \" was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 1998 ceremony , for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance and Best R & B Song . The song did not win either nomination , a typical trend of Carey 's nominations at the Grammys . \" Honey \" won many prestigious awards throughout the music industry in 1997 and 1998 . The song was nominated at the 1998 Grammy Awards for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance and Best R & B Song . Additionally , the song won the BMI Pop Award for \" Songwriter . \" = = Chart performance = = \" Honey \" became Carey 's third single to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 ; the most number one debuts of any artist to this day . Additionally , the song became her 12th chart topper , breaking the fifth place record she had shared with Whitney Houston and tying Madonna . It replaced \" Mo Money Mo Problems \" by The Notorious B.I.G. featuring Puff Daddy and Mase , and it was replaced by Boyz II Men 's \" 4 Seasons of Loneliness . \" At this point , Carey was tied with The Supremes for fourth most US number ones , behind Michael Jackson with thirteen , and Elvis Presley and The Beatles with 17 and 20 , respectively . \" Honey \" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting shipments of over one million units . The song stalled at number two on the Hot R & B / Hip-Hop Songs , spending 22 weeks in the chart . \" Honey \" finished number 32 on the Billboard end of year chart for 1997 . In Canada , the song debuted on the RPM Singles Chart at forty-eight on the RPM issue dated August 18 , 1997 , and reached the top of the chart on September 22 , 1997 . It was present on the chart for a total of 20 weeks , and ranked 18 on the RPM Year-end chart for 1997 . The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart on September 6 , 1997 at its peak of number three , and spent a total of eight weeks in the chart . \" Honey \" is Carey 's 15th best-selling single in the United Kingdom as of 2010 , with estimated sales of 165,000 .

In Sweden , the song performed well , peaking at number eight and staying within the chart for ten weeks . In Austria and France , \" Honey \" peaked at number 39 , spending one and four weeks on the charts , respectively . The song peaked at number 29 and 30 in Belgium Flanders and Wallonia . = = Music video = = Aside from the attention surrounding the song , the music video garnered much speculation . For the first time in her career , Carey was featured provocatively dressed , giving viewers a \" taste of the freer Mariah . \" The Puerto Rico-filmed video 's concept was created by Carey with Paul Hunter filling in as the director . Serving a James Bond theme , Carey was cast as \" the very sexy agent M \" , a woman who escapes a large mansion in which she has been held captive . Carey said of the video that \" I don 't really think the video is overtly sexual , but for me-I mean people used to think I was the nineties version of Mary Poppins ! \" The video premiered on MTV and BET in September 1997 and was shot in Puerto Rico on July 26 , 1997 . The video begins with Carey , playing as \" Agent M , \" being held hostage in a large mansion . The captors are played by Eddie Griffin , Frank Sivero , and Johnny Brennan of The Jerky Boys , who continue to taunt Carey over her capture and eventual death . \" Agent M \" speaks in Spanish to the captors , saying she can not understand them . After a series of dialogue , Carey escapes her Griffin 's character and dives into a swimming pool from the mansion 's roof . After an ensemble change , Carey dons a swimsuit and escapes the island via a watercraft . The video 's antagonists continue their pursuit of Carey throughout a large body of water , until she arrives aboard a large ship . It is unclear if both scenes are happening separately or side by side . Throughout most of the video , Carey is seen posing on a large sailboat , while wearing a white bikini . After boarding the ship , Carey begins dancing and is soon joined by a group of male sailors . After a sequence of dance light dance routines , Carey is seen on an island with her lover , male model David Fumero , and her real life dog , Jack . They frolic together on the island , while Carey happily enjoys her romance . During the time of the video 's release , Carey and Mottola were in the midst of their divorce and this led to many speculation on the video 's message . Tabloids and critics were linking the video 's theme to Carey 's marriage , writing how Mottola would lock Carey in their mansion . While Carey denied the allegations , many found it to be very obvious . Carey 's writing partner of six years , Afanasieff , felt the video was undeniably about Mottola . While speculation about the video grew , Carey continued to deny any intention of portraying her marriage in the video . In an interview , Carey said that \" Tommy loves the video , he says it 's my best video yet . \" The song 's Bad Boy remix featured a different music video as well . It features the same concept , however not emphasizing on the kidnapping and escape . The video begins with Carey diving into the pool , and driving a watercraft . As she reaches a point far into the body of water , she is offered a rope lift from a helicopter . After she accepts and ascends the line , Carey boards the aircraft alongside its pilots , Puffy and the members of Bad Boy Entertainment . Other scenes sequence Carey dancing with Puffy in a golden indoor tunnel . As the video concludes , more staff from the helicopter join Carey in the golden entryway , as they dance and enjoy themselves . = = Remixes = = Several remixes were commissioned for \" Honey , \" most notably the Bad Boy remix and the Classic mix , the latter of which appears on Carey 's remix compilation The Remixes ( 2003 ) . The former is similar to the original version , with the addition of a new spoken intro from Carey in which she states , \" I thought I told you , we won 't stop . \" The string chords present in the original \" Honey \" are entirely excised from the Bad Boy remix , and it features rapping verses by The Lox and Mase ( who did the bridge on the original version ) . The rap from Mase entirely replaces the second chorus of the song , while the Lox 's parts replaces a section of the song 's bridge . The song 's main remix , \" Honey \" ( Bad Boy remix ) , has an accompanying music video , with additional sequences directed by Paul Hunter . Much of the footage from the video is from the original , with few new scenes featuring Carey with Puffy , Mase and the Lox in a long golden tunnel flowing with water ( \" The Honey Tunnel \" ) . During Mase 's rap , Carey is rescued by them ( rather than joining the sailors on the boat ) when he lowers a rope into the ocean from his helicopter . Another major hip-hop mix of the song was released : \" Honey \" ( So So Def mix ) , produced by Jermaine Dupri and featuring rap verses from him and Da Brat . Carey re-recorded some of her vocals , but most lyrical and melodic structures were kept similar to the album version . The song uses a new sample from \" It 's Great to Be Here \" ( originally performed by The Jackson 5 ) , but it does not use \" The Body Rock \" melody from the album version and Bad Boy remix . The So So Def remix does use the sample of \" Hey DJ , \" but in a different manner : both the album and Bad Boy remixes use the piano riff from \" Hey DJ , \" while the So So Def remix uses the line \" Hey JD , won 't you play that song , keep them dancing , dancing all night . \" David Morales created several dance remixes of the song , the most notable being \" Honey \" ( Classic mix ) , and variations of this include \" Honey \" ( Def Club mix ) , \" Honey \" ( Rascal dub ) , and \" Honey \" ( Boss Anthem mix ) . These give songwriting credit to the writers of \" The Body Rock , \" although this is not sampled . Morales is also credited as a songwriter for the remixes , although they are close to the original melodic and lyrical structure of the original song . = = Live performances = = \" Honey \" was performed on various live television appearances as well as most of Carey 's tours . Carey first performed a mash-up of the song and the Bad Boy remix live on the British music chart program Top of the Pops in 1997 . The performance incorporated themes from both videos , in which Carey was dressed in the same white bikini from the music video . Additionally , the stage was set up to resemble the deck of a ship . Dancers similar to the video joined Carey on stage as she performed the song . Carey performed \" Honey \" at the 1998 World Music Awards . The performance garnered her a standing ovation , and featured many male dancers , all donning sailor costumes . After the second verse , a large projection of the Bad Boy remix video played while pre-recorded rap verses from Puffy played . A live performance of the song was taped via satellite and aired live in Japan , featuring similar costumes and themes as the others . Carey performed the song throughout her Butterfly World Tour ( 1998 ) , which served as the accompanying tour for Butterfly . During her live routine of the song , various male dancers donned in similar sailor outfits joined Carey on stage . Serving as an intro to the song , Carey re-enacts the hostage from the video , and formulates her escape . The song 's performance in Taipei , Taiwan was used as the official act of the song on Carey 's 1998 concert DVD , Around the World , which featured live tapings from Japan , Taiwan , Australia and the US . For her Rainbow World Tour ( 2000 ) , the beginning of the original video served as the acts intro . As the music began playing , Carey emerged wearing a mini sailor suit and a matching headpiece . During the set , many male dancers joined Carey on stage , and re-enacted a similar performance than that of her previous tour . \" Honey \" was performed during Carey 's following tour , the Charmbracelet World Tour ( 2002 \u2013 2003 ) . The performances of the song throughout the tour were altered from those in 1997 \u2013 98 . The act began with the video intro like before , however the dancers featured , no longer bared any resemblance to the video . Male and female dancers joined , performing traditional and exotic dance routines . Carey donned a blue one piece mini skirt , and joins with some light dance moves . Carey continued performing the song throughout her 2006 tour , The Adventures of Mimi . The performance did not include any video intro , but did introduce a four-piece of male dancers dressed in sailor outfits . Carey wore a pair of black leggings , accompanied by a sparkling mini-bra . During the performance in Madison Square Garden , Carey was joined with Sean \" Diddy \" Combs ( previously known as Puffy ) on stage after the second verse . During her Angels Advocate Tour ( 2010 ) performance of the song , Carey donned a sparkling mini-Herve Leger gown , with a faux-fur snug jacket . During the song , male and female dancers joined her on stage , and performed up-tempo dance routines .

It was co-written by Swift and Liz Rose , and produced by Nathan Chapman . It was released on February 3 , 2008 by Big Machine Records as the fourth single from Swift 's eponymous studio album , Taylor Swift ( 2006 ) . It was inspired by the narcissistic and cocky nature of her former high school classmate and ex-boyfriend Jordan Alford with whom Swift never established a formal relationship . In retrospect , Swift has stated that she has evolved on a personal level and as a songwriter , claiming she processed emotions differently since \" Picture to Burn \" .

The music video for \" Picture to Burn \" was directed by Trey Fanjoy and features Swift fantasizing about taking revenge on her ex-boyfriend after she discovers him with another woman . The video also has Swift and her band performing with pyrotechnics as a backdrop .

She was his classmate at Hendersonville High School in Tennessee and they went out before he dated classmate Chelsea who would later become his wife . \" ' They dated in freshman year , but then after that , girl code , once you date an ex-boyfriend you 're not friends anymore . Picture To Burn is about him . Because he 's always had big old trucks and stuff , ' Taylor Swift said . She was frequently frustrated by his narcissistic and cocky nature , and decided to write a song about how she felt at her after school job , writing songs for Sony / ATV Music . It was co-written with Liz Rose on guitar , and given a comedic edge ( an idea of Swift 's ) . Swift found herself sitting , playing her guitar , and saying , \" I hate his stupid truck that he doesn 't let me drive . He 's such a redneck ! Oh my God ! ' , a line that was ultimately developed into the song 's chorus . Swift described it as brutally honest , and cited it as an example of how she expresses herself if someone leaves her heartbroken , offends her , or is hostile towards her . Furthermore , she said \" Picture to Burn \" became the only song driven by anger on Taylor Swift , a topic she felt most teenage females could identify to . \" It 's OK to be mad after a breakup or after something goes wrong with a relationship \" , Swift said .

Swift recalled that , although \" Tim McGraw \" ( 2006 ) was her only single at the time she began opening for Rascal Flatts ' Me and My Gang Tour ( 2006 \u2013 07 ) , \" Picture to Burn \" was the performance in which the crowd seemed to be the most enthusiastic with most screaming it \" at the top of their lungs \" . In retrospect , Swift has stated that the song was something typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time , adding \" I didn 't know anything then . \" She explained , \" I had this song called ' Picture to Burn , ' that 's talking about how ' I hate your truck , ' and ' I hate that you ignored me , ' ' I hate you . ' Now , the way that I would say that and the way that I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different . \" Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter , she claimed not to be regretful of \" Picture to Burn \" , rather happy she was able to demonstrate \" those emotions that when you 're so angry , you hate everything . It 's like recording your diary over the years , and that 's a gift \" , she said . = = Composition = = \" Picture to Burn \" is a country song with a length of two minutes and 55 seconds .

The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation : \" There 's no time for tears / I 'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There 's nothing stopping me / From goin ' out with all of your best friends . \" For the refrains , she speaks of igniting fire on photographs of her ex-boyfriend , concluding them with a musical punch line , \" As far as I 'm concerned / You 're just another picture to burn \" .

Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine selected the track as one of Swift 's six best singles , and stated , \" She really shows her age in this one \" . Roger Holland of PopMatters commented that the song was the epitome of how , according to him , Swift was more given in uptempo tempos , and that it served as indication to the nature of Swift 's debut album . Holland added , \" ' Picture to Burn ' is two parts Ashlee Simpson to one part Amy Dalley , with an overly familiar guitar melody that could have been lifted directly from the latter . \" Top music critic Robert Christgau selected \" Picture to Burn \" as a highlight on Taylor Swift . Josh Love of The Village Voice attributed the song to be one of the reasons how the singer rose to stardom . He called it a \" bluntly relatable composition [ ... ] that connected [ Swift ] with teens from across the spectrum . \" Patrick McDonald of The Seattle Times called it a \" clever , sassy , upbeat song \" Alison Bonaguro of the Chicago Tribune said the song was a \" clean-but-still-rowdy \" number for Swift .

The single was certified gold by Music Canada for sales of 40,000 digital downloads . = = Music video = = The accompanying music video for \" Picture to Burn \" was directed by Trey Fanjoy , who directed all three of Swift 's prior music videos . Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she felt that since Fanjoy directed her prior videos , she knew how to deviate from it and what new grounds to cover . As opposed to their previous collaborations , the video was conceptualized to be edgy and comical . Swift herself was styled edgier than usual , sporting clothing , hair , and jewelry she was not accustomed to . She was intended to wear thigh-length boots , but was not able to find a pair to correspond with her height . Instead , her stylist sewed black fabric to strap onto black high heels to give the illusion of thigh-length boots . The video 's plot was conjectured to involve rampaging and seeking revenge on her ex-boyfriend . Swift chose football player Justin Sandy to portray her ex-boyfriend in the video , believing he had a classic and suspiciously perfect demeanor ; she described him as \" real like Ken \" . Swift desired to portray her backup band 's sense of humor , and thus enlisted them for the video . Swift 's real-life best friend Abigail Anderson also made a cameo appearance in the video . The video was filmed over the course of two days in Nashville , Tennessee . On the first day , performance scenes were filmed inside the Sommet Center ( now named the Bridgestone Arena ) , and involved pyrotechnics . Swift was at first nervous about the shoot , as it was her first experience with pyrotechnics . \" There are some things I 'm nervous about . My hair could very well catch on fire \" , she said . She was later assured of its safety and explained to about the discrepancy in the distance of the fire in reality than on camera : on camera , it appears to be quite close to her , whereas , in actuality , it was placed far behind her . On the second day , the remaining scenes were filmed at a suburban house in Nashville . Props were provided by the video personnel . On the set , Fanjoy suggested using a binoculars for the primary scenes , but Swift disagreed , believing it could come across as cheesy depending on how it was filmed . She ultimately succumbed to the idea due to Fanjoy explaining how it would translate on camera . The video premiered on March 14 , 2008 on AOL 's The Boot . It commences with Swift and her best friend in a grey 2009 Ford Mustang GT 45th Anniversary Edition , parked behind a tree . Swift reminiscences , looking at a photograph of her and her ex-boyfriend together , and states , \" Would you look at how happy we were back then ? I can 't believe he turned out to be such a jerk . \" Anderson is then seen ogling outside the window with binoculars , and spots Swift 's ex-boyfriend and another woman arriving in a black late 90s ford f150 pick-up truck . She notes the other woman in driving the truck , and Swift states angrily he never allowed her to drive it . As Swift 's ex-boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck , and the music begins and the music video transcends to a concrete room where the singer ( clothed by a grey , one-shoulder mini-dress and black leather , thigh-length boots ) is playing an electric guitar , alongside her backup band . During \" Picture to Burn \" ' s chorus , fire ignites behind them . Afterwards , the band is depicted entering a house furtively , using flashlights . Swift is sitting on a brown couch , sporting a black tank top , black leather pants , and beehive hair , as the band ransacks the house . They throw darts at photographs of him , envelop all of his furniture with toilet paper , mess his mirror with the word \" loser \" , lick his utensils and spit into his mouthwash . Suddenly , the ex-boyfriend and the woman are shown approaching the house , and , seeing this , Anderson informs them of it via handheld transceiver . He enters the house and discovers it was ransacked , and repeats the word \" Taylor \" . The video then transitions to Anderson and Swift inside the Ford Mustang , with Anderson also repeating \" Taylor \" . She then suggests leaving , and Swift says , \" You know what ? I 'm over it . \" The video concludes with the photograph of Swift and her ex-boyfriend in flames , thrown in the sidewalk . Cut-scenes feature Swift and her band performing in the concrete room , Swift singing on the couch , or Swift dancing affront a shower of sparks . To date , the video has 76 million views on YouTube . = = Live performances = = Swift first performed the track at Billboard headquarters in 2006 . She then performed \" Picture to Burn \" as she opened for Rascal Flatts on several dates , from October 19 to November 3 , 2006 , included on the Me and My Gang Tour ( 2006 \u2013 07 ) . Swift performed the song dressed in a black , knee-length dress and red cowboy boots with a design of a skull and crossbones across it , as she roamed around the stage . She also performed the song when she served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait 's 2007 United States tour , and selected dates for Brad Paisley 's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour in 2007 . During mid-2007 , Swift embarked as the opening act on several dates for Tim McGraw 's and Faith Hill 's joint tour , Soul2Soul II Tour ( 2006 \u2013 07 ) , where she again performed the song .

During 2009 performances , Swift donned a black cocktail dress with sparkly ornaments along the stomach , as she roamed throughout the stage , which was projected with images of searing flames , singing the song . In the 2010 extension , Swift bared a spangly , violet mini-dress . Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News believed \" Picture to Burn \" ' s performance on April 11 , 2010 at the HP Pavilion in San Jose , California demonstrated how versatile Swift was as a performer , feeling equally at gusto with tender ballads and uptempo rockers . Of the performance at the tour 's final concert on June 5 , 2010 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough , Massachusetts , Jay N. Miller of The Patriot Ledger said , \" She strutted down the catwalk chastising another hapless ex-boyfriend \" .

Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said \" Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye \u2013 style automooing . He 's quite good at it , too . Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings . There 's a middle bit , and it 's like nothing else in the song ... It sounds more like someone doing the \" I 've lost my keys \" song , just before they leave the house in the morning . The odd thing is that it was left in there . I mean if minimal is your bag , surely that 'd be the first bit to cut ? \" He awarded in four out of five stars . Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song , saying , \" Lyrically and stylistically , it \u2019 s a pretty standard club track \u2014 over various synth beats , the song covers the usual topics : hot girls dancing , crowds waiting to have fun , and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week ... But honestly , we \u2019 re just overjoyed this song isn \u2019 t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy \u2019 s various products . \" However Nicki Escudero of the Phoenix New Times said that although the song was good for what it is , it lacked substance . \" Now that Diddy-Dirty Money has had success with a superficial track about money , sex and cheating , here 's hoping the group will release a deeper song about something more meaningful . Unfortunately , hope can only go so far . \" Meanwhile , Michael Cragg from The Guardian 's music blog commented that the UK remix featuring Skepta salvages what would otherwise be a boring Diddy track . \" Thankfully , UK grime king , Skepta , has rescued the song by pushing Diddy to the periphery \u2013 his flow consists of going ' uh ' , ' Skepta ' and spelling out ' D.I.D.D.Y. # \u2013 setting off a smorgasbord of sonic explosions , tightening the whole thing up and making it sound a lot darker and more thrilling than a host of US producers could manage .

In an interview for MTV , Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel : \" When I first heard the idea about doing a part two , I was just completely against it . I just felt like you couldn 't beat the ' original ' . There 's no way you can outdo that , so why compete with it ? \" . She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem , sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey , her reservations about recording it went away . While the demo was only accompanied by a piano , Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem . \" Love the Way You Lie \" and \" Love the Way You Lie ( Part II ) \" were based on a demo written and recorded in late 2009 by Grey .

Emily Mackay of NME commented about the vocals provided by Rihanna and Eminem in the song , stating that \" There \u2019 s great contrast in Part II of \u2018 Love The Way You Lie \u2019 . With the balance of vocals neatly flipped and extra cavernous beats ramping up the drama , it wallows ever-deeper in the tortured relationship sketched out in Part I. Eminem at points is practically screaming with rage , and sounding , frankly , mental .

' It \u2019 s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied , ' she sings . A lone piano humanizes her first vocals , and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve ; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage . It \u2019 s purely theatrical , but it \u2019 s also , for a moment , raw .

Will the real Rihanna please stand up ? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever . \" James Skinner of BBC Online viewed ' Love the Way You Lie ( Part II ) ' as being even better than the original . He said , \" Eminem \u2019 s verse exuding the kind of volatile , simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place . But it is Rihanna \u2019 s vocal \u2013 at once commanding , soulful and vulnerable \u2013 that anchors the song , and Loud itself , elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting . \" Steve Jones of USA Today gave a mixed review of the collaboration , commenting , \" Eminem puts in a cameo on ' Love the Way You Lie ( Part II ) ' , which extends , but doesn 't really add , to their earlier hit about a tortured relationship from his Recovery album . \" Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave a negative review of the song , stating , \" She collaborated with Eminem this summer on the controversial ' \" Love the Way You Lie \" ' , a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault . She returns to this on \" Loud \" with \" Love the Way You Lie ( Part II ) \" , an extension of the melody and the arson metaphor , in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her , loving her , hitting her and hugging her . It 's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue : Is this a social statement , or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people . \" = = Chart performance = = Both the original and the piano version of \" Love the Way You Lie ( Part II ) \" were not made available to purchase individually in the majority of iTunes stores , and could only be bought along with the iTunes edition of the album . However , the song may be purchased separately as part of the album INdependent omen Volume II . It debuted on Canadian Hot 100 for the week of December 4 , 2010 , at number 19 and stayed on the chart for eight weeks . In South Korea , it peaked at number four on the International Chart . The song also debuted and peaked at number 160 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong digital sales upon the release of Loud . = = Live performances = = Rihanna performed a shortened version of the song as part of a medley with \" What 's My Name ? \" and \" Only Girl ( In the World ) \" at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21 , 2010 . Rihanna opened the performance singing an acappella version of \" Love The Way You Lie ( Part II ) \" . She was sitting on a stylized tree hovering above a field of sable-colored blades of grass . Once she had finished the first frame of the song , she plummeted from the tree to the ground . She reemerged from the fog revealing a changed costume now consisting of a black-and-white bra top and shorts singing \" What 's My Name ? \" . The performance featured an accompaniment of background dancers . Rihanna then ended the performance after transitioning into \" Only Girl \" , which featured drummers and a background of fire for the finale . Rihanna and Eminem performed the song together for the first time at the 53rd Grammy Awards on February 13 , 2011 as part of a medley with \" I Need a Doctor \" performed by Eminem , Dr. Dre , Skylar Grey and Adam Levine from Maroon 5 , who provided background vocals .

                    "text": "When Love Takes Over = \" When Love Takes Over \" is a song by French DJ-music producer David Guetta with vocals by Kelly Rowland from his fourth studio album , One Love . It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records ( EMI France ) . The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008 ; American recording artist Kelly Rowland , who fell in love with the track , convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it . It was co-written by Nervo . According to Rowland , the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am ( 2011 ) , while Guetta noted \" When Love Takes Over \" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds . Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track . Veronica Ferraro mixed the song , focussing primarily on giving Rowland 's vocals a magical and inspiring tone . Critics would later state that Rowland 's vocals on \" When Love Take Over \" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist . The song 's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other , while the production bears some similarities to Coldplay 's 2002 hit single , \" Clocks \" , particularly the opening riff . \" When Love Takes Over \" has been praised by many critics . Most noted the addition of Rowland 's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love . The production was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments . It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries , including in the United Kingdom , Republic of Ireland , Italy and Switzerland . At the time of release , it became Guetta 's highest charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland 's second number one single in the United Kingdom . \" When Love Takes Over \" ranked at number one on Billboard 's Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart . In 2013 , Billboard named \" When Love Takes Over \" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time , in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release . In the song 's accompanying music video , Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together . It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result . \" When Love Takes Over \" was promoted mainly at award shows , including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards , NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards . Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \" When Love Takes Over \" for the annual Miss Universe competition . The single earned seven Platinum certifications as well as five Gold certificates , selling over 5,5 million copies worldwide . Additionally , it earned Guetta two Grammy Award nominations for \" Best Dance Recording \" and \" Best Non-Classical , Remixed Recording \" , the latter of which Guetta won for his \" Electro Extended Mix \" of \" When Love Takes Over \" . = = Background = = Rowland has acknowledged on several occasions that although she loved dance music , it was not really the type of music she would record . While in Europe in 2008 , she met Guetta at one of his DJ shows in Southern France , and commented that \" Listening to him was just crazy . \" Guetta was playing the instrumental version of \" When Love Takes Over \" . Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes , Rowland remarked , \" I felt so much emotion from the track ; something happened the first time I heard it , and it was just beautiful . And I remember thinking ' Why is this touching me like this ? ' You know , it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it ! \" Upon meeting Guetta , she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics . \" So I met David and asked him for the track ... He gave it to me , and I brought it back here to London , UK and wrote the actual song \" . At a writing session in a London hotel room , Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta 's backing track . Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lef\u00e8vre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song . Later in a 2010 interview , The Nervo Twins revealed that Rowland 's record label were not keen on the song despite their and Rowland 's enthusiasm . Consequently , \" When Love Takes Over \" was shelved until Guetta rediscovered the song when compiling his fourth studio album , One Love . The finished song with Rowland 's vocals and Guetta 's production was premiered in March 2009 at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami . A month later on 21 April 2009 , the single was released in Europe , and the United States . In the UK , the single 's release had to be brought forward to 11 June 2009 to combat an \" inferior \" cover version released on 9 May 2009 . Additionally , beginning in July / August 2009 , American TV channel Bravo licensed the song for a two-month period , to use for in-house advertising . = = Recording and production = = The recording and mixing of \" When Love Takes Over \" took place in summer and autumn of 2008 . After Rowland heard the instrumental of \" When Love Takes Over \" \u2014 a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion \u2014 she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on . She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London , within a day . She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo ( The Nervo Twins ) . However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album . After getting selected for the album , \" When Love Takes Over \" was given to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer who , aside from producing the song with Guetta , was tasked the final audio mixing of the song . However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro , who would later go on to say that \" Reisterer was supposed to mix it , but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out . The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit . \" The track was mixed in September 2008 , at Ferraro 's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris , the day after her birthday . Before working on the song 's individual elements , Ferraro converted the recording sessions from a generic digital audio workstation system to her programme of choice , Pro Tools . Following this , she decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland 's vocals . \" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards , so I did not change very much . I just did some standard things , with EQ and compression and things like that . After that my obsession was to get the vocals to sound as good as possible . When I 'm mixing a track , I want something to happen , something that takes the listener somewhere . You want the right things in the right place , but it 's not a technical issue . It 's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place \u2013 the mixing has to be magic . It was not difficult in this case , because I knew the song would be a hit , but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical , like an angel singing , so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious . I wanted to make sure that the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn 't lose you . \" Ferraro told Sound On Sound that she did add a bass drum sample , as she felt that the kick was missing something . \" Rather than equalise it , I added a little bit of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger \" . However she did alter the two piano elements of the song , using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay . Additionally , Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track 's instruments , including the violin , strings and guitar samples . She then moved on to Rowland 's vocals , which \" were extensively processed \" , including equalization and de-essing . Then upon completion of her work on the song , Ferraro sent \" When Love Takes Over \" to her husband , Bruno Gruel , and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio . Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format , 24-bit / 44.1 kHz . He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song , particularly the bass drums and low synths . = = Composition = = \" When Love Takes Over \" is a synthpop and \" uplifting floor-filler \" produced by Guetta and his associate Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer . Jason Lipshutz from Billboard magazine described it as a \" pop number built around a lush piano loop and throbbing percussion \" with trance elements . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , the song was written in the key of F Mixolydian with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 130 beats per minute . The chord progression is Cm / F \u2013 Gm / F \u2013 F4 \u2013 F. The final recording and mixing took place at Gum Prod Studios in Paris . Some elements of the song were compared to the riff and piano opener in the song \" Clocks \" by Coldplay . After gaining Guetta 's approval to write vocals for the song , Rowland took the instrumental version to London , where she wrote the bulk of the lyrics with The Nervo Twins ( Miriam and Olivia Nervo ) before sending the song back to Guetta , who added his own contributions with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer . Rowland uses a vocal range of F3 to D5 . Guetta said that \" Kelly [ ' s vocals ] had this Whitney Houston vibe and nailed it . \" Critics agreed , noting that often her vocals were \" powerful \" and \" grand \" . Others called them \" a diva masterclass \" and \" emotionally charged \" . Fraser McAlpine from BBC Online compared Rowland 's vocals to those by Madonna in \" Ray of Light \" , for their \" hands-in-the-air pop song \" qualities . = = Critical reception = = The song received critical acclaim from music critics for both Guetta 's catchy production and Rowland 's strong vocals . It was called the strongest and most commercial single choice from Guetta 's album , One Love . Critics noted that the song 's opening piano riff was similar to that from Coldplay 's hit single \" Clocks \" ( 2002 ) . David Jefferes of Allmusic gave the song a thumbs up saying , calling \" When Love Takes Over \" one of the strongest songs from One Love and praising the \" [ addition of ] the powerful voice of Kelly Rowland for one grand , uplifting floor-filler . \" Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly agreed calling the song the \" most memorable from the album \" and recalling \" Clocks \" by Coldplay to make \" a showstopper starring Kelly Rowland . \" Michael Hibbard of MusicOMH was impressed with both the production and vocal work on \" When Love Takes Over \" . He pointed out the rarity in the amount of promotion given to the song , referring to \" When Love Takes Over \" being given \" its own poster on the Tube . \" He also described the song as a \" euphoric masterpiece \" backed by \" at least eight remixes \" and the accompany vocals from \" Destiny 's Child songbird Kelly Rowland on hand for a diva masterclass . \" Also agreeing with these comments was Fraser McAlpine from BBC Online who awarded the song four out of five stars . \" The genius ingredients include a thinly reworked go at the piano riff to ' Clocks ' by Coldplay and handclaps ... And the fairy dust is ... well ... it 's your standard dance-pop production , actually . \" However he noted that the production was \" tastefully done to make sure that the good bits are not spoilt \" . Other elements of the song such as the \" bed of synthistrings , a skippy beat , a breakdown , some riffing glassy electronics and a dramatic , cinematic bottom end drone \" were praised . McAlpine also praised Rowland 's appearance on the track , commenting who she sounded \" entirely unlike herself , so that even SHE is all buffed up and shiny . \" He described the marriage of Rowland 's vocals and Guetta 's production by stating that \" [ Rowland 's ] got a spiralling , sky-scraping melody to sing too . \" Erin Martin of PopMatters said that \" When Love Takes Over \" had euphoric properties . Martin said the song was \" a classic , triumphant dance number , and Rowland 's powerhouse vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come . This song just feels good to listen to \" . She also noted that the song was central to the concept and \" love-spreading message [ that ] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole . \" David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song 's anthem credentials . \" [ It ] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyonc\u00e9 [ Knowles ' ] shadow . Fusing classic dance beats with a heady , emotionally charged vocal , it 's a world away from the mid-tempo R & B numbers with which she started her solo career . In fact , this packs a punch from the very first listen , meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009 . \" However , Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics , simply noting the song as \" a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay 's ' Clocks ' . \" Wood did however state that it was among Guetta 's best work and was an example of when the DJ is \" most commercial \" . The song was nominated for the Best Dance Recording award at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony . It lost out to \" Poker Face \" by Lady Gaga . The song 's Electro Extended Remix was successful at the ceremony , winning Guetta his first Grammy Award for the Best Remixed Recording , Non-Classical . In 2013 , Billboard named \" When Love Takes Over \" their number one dance-pop collaboration of all time . = = Chart performance = = In Guetta 's native France , \" When Love Takes Over \" debuted on the French Digital Chart at number 14 on 25 April 2009 before subsequently peaking at number three on 18 July 2009 .

He said , \" you see Kelly doing her thing and then me on the other side doing mine . Eventually we come together just like how we recorded the song . It 's all about sharing the love from this record and making a big party \" .

Melinda Newman from Hitfix praised Rowland 's role in the clip saying that \" [ Rowland ] is fierce throughout and it clearly experiencing a bit of a career resurgence after a dip . [ She ] gives her best Beyonc\u00e9-type stares straight into the camera ( but we 're sure that 's just a coincidence ) ... Guetta , who is relegated to a supporting role in his own video , shows up pushing his gear on a cart , looking basically like any other homeless guy hanging out in Venice . \" Some criticism did follow the video . Capital FM radio station felt that Guetta 's appearance in the clip was slightly disappointing . \" Guetta looks a bit like a binman pushing his gear round the streets in some of the earlier shots in the video \" . Newman said that the video 's director , Jonas \u00c5kerlund , had removed something from the song . \" The video could have built on the great beat that builds within the song and the feeling of abandon that falling in love can bring you , but , instead , we get a telegenic couple making out who seem to drop in from nowhere . \" = = Performances and promotion = = Guetta premiered the completed version of \" When Love Takes Over \" on 23 March 2009 at the Ultra Music Festival .

The cover debuted and peaked at number twenty-two , selling 12,000 copies whilst Guetta and Rowland 's version debuted at number seven with 25,000 copies . According to Yahoo !

The team is famous for being the first Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing a match . This feat earned them the nickname of The Invincibles , and they are regarded as one of the greatest cricket teams of all time . According to the Australian federal government the team \" is one of Australia 's most cherished sporting legends \" . Including five Test matches , Australia played a total of 31 first-class fixtures , plus three other games , two of the non-first-class matches being played in Scotland . They had a busy schedule , with 112 days of play scheduled in 144 days , meaning that they often played every day of the week except Sunday . Their record in the first-class games was 23 won and 8 drawn ; in all matches , they won 25 and drew 9 ; many of the victories were by large margins . They won the Test series 4 \u2013 0 with one draw . The strength of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line-up , which included Bradman , Arthur Morris , vice-captain Lindsay Hassett , Neil Harvey and Sid Barnes , and the hostile fast bowling of Ray Lindwall , Keith Miller and Bill Johnston . Due to the popularity of Bradman , generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time , and the fact that he had announced that it was his farewell international tour , the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country , and many records for match attendances were broken . The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times , in the Second , Third and Fourth Tests , and stands to this day . = = Touring party = = = = Significance = = The 1948 Australian team has great significance in cricket history as it is the only side to tour England unbeaten , earning the sobriquet The Invincibles . The tour was captain Donald Bradman 's last Test series , and the immediate postwar team was the most successful that Bradman appeared in . It has been claimed that English cricket suffered more heavily from the effects of World War II than the Australians . Even so , various commentators have rated the 1948 Australians as one of the best cricket teams ever , and it is often compared to other great outfits such as the 1902 Australian touring team , Warwick Armstrong 's Australian side of just after World War I , the West Indies team of the 1980s and the Australian team of the 1990s and 2000s . This was not a view shared by Jack Fingleton , Bradman 's batting rival from the 1930s , who wrote ' the 1948 Australian side to England , side that some critics , ignoring the apparent lack of strength in English cricket that season , dubbed the \" best Australian team ever \" \u2013 which was just moonshine . Yorkshire almost beat the Australians of 1948 ' , but his view is very much in the minority . The high regard with which The Invincibles are held in the annals of Australian and world cricket is reflected in the various honours accorded to the players . Bradman , Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 . Hassett , Morris and Harvey were later inducted , so that 20 % of the inductees are from the 1948 team . Of these six , all except Hassett were selected in Australia 's Team of the Century , with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy . Bradman , Lindwall , Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council 's Hall of Fame . In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians . Graveney strongly disagreed with the result , writing ' there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman 's Australian tourists of 1948 ' . The computer regarded Sam Loxton as a member of the team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey , if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team . = = Preparations = = Since the resumption of cricket following World War II , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and their captain Donald Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . The committee that selected the touring party was Bradman , Jack Ryder and Chappie Dwyer . They held their final meeting on Wednesday 11 February and announced the team that day . The team was chosen with a dual emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling . This was in large part because England had agreed to make a new ball available after 55 six-ball overs in the Tests ; a new ball was generally taken after every 200 runs , which usually takes more than 55 overs to accumulate , the rule change meant that a new ball was more frequently available . A new ball is more helpful to fast bowling , so this move favoured the team with the better pace attack , in this case Australia . Australia had injury concerns to key players ahead of the tour . Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack , and he only made the trip after a 3 \u2013 2 vote by a medical panel , despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit . Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon . In addition , his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action . The injury was worked on ahead of the tour , while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action . The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled , and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied . Bradman 's counsel was effective , as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour . Bill Jeanes , who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the previous Australian tour of England in 1938 , was offered the job of managing the 1948 team , but turned it down . Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that cricket historian Gideon Haigh has called \" increasingly officious and liverish \" . He was replaced by Keith Johnson , the New South Wales delegate to the Australian Board of Control . Johnson had previously managed the Australian Services team \u2014 which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett \u2014 in the Victory Tests that took place in 1945 at the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe . = = = Warm-up matches in Australia = = = Before they sailed for England , Australia played three warm-up matches . The first two were two-day games against Tasmania in Hobart and at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground , Launceston ; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth . In Hobart , Australia scored 538 / 5 declared with centuries by Barnes , Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122 . Using a mixture of pace and spin , they reduced Tasmania to 186 / 7 when time ran out . In Launceston , Australia won by an innings and 49 runs . Toshack took 5 / 24 as Tasmania fell for 123 . Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116 , Barnes taking 3 / 1 . Four days later , on Saturday 13 March , the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia . Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112 , while five bowlers took two wickets each . Australia replied with 442 / 7 declared , including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman . Western Australia only had time to reach 62 / 3 and the game was drawn . The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500 . = = Voyage and stopover in Ceylon = = The team set sail on board RMS Strathaird from Fremantle on Friday 19 March . En route to England , the Australians berthed in Colombo where they played a one-day single-innings match \u2014 not limited overs \u2014 against the Ceylon national team at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground . The local newspaper The Islander ran a headline of \" Bradman Will Definitely Play \" and this guaranteed a crowd of more than 20,000 . Australia batted first and became suspicious about the pitch as the morning went on . At lunch , Ian Johnson demanded that the pitch be measured and it was found to be only 20 yards ( 18 m ) long . After that , the bowlers delivered from two yards behind the crease . Australia made 184 / 8 declared ( Barnes 49 , Miller 46 ) before a monsoon ended the match with Ceylon at 46 / 2 in reply . The party docked at Tilbury on Friday 16 April to a resounding welcome . Bradman announced the delivery of 17,000 food parcels as a gift to the British people from the State of Victoria . Great Britain was still in the throes of rationing and post-war austerity . = = Popularity = = Despite Australia 's ruthless on-field dominance and a succession of one-sided victories , the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest . Bradman 's dominant cricketing stature was a key factor in his team 's popularity with the public , especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign . A leading cricket writer of the time , R. C. Robertson-Glasgow , said \" we want him to do well . We feel we have a share in him . He is more than Australian . He is a world batsman . \" The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that \" cities , towns and hotels are beflagged , carpets set down , and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome . He is the Prince of Cricketers . \" Writing later , Haigh opined that \" perhaps no touring cricketer ... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer \" . Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day , and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live , causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin . Of Bradman 's retirement , Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack : \" ... a miracle has been removed from among us ... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal . \" As a team , the Australians were greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country , even when wet weather curtailed the matches . The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times , in the Second Test at Lord 's , the Third Test at Old Trafford , and the Fourth Test at Headingley . The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil . Off the field , the Australians were inundated with requests for social functions , including appointments with government officials and members of the royal family , and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements , with 112 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days . Three-day matches were often held consecutively with only the traditional Sunday rest day , although their dominance ended several matches prematurely and earned them extra rest days . Team manager Keith Johnson , the only administrator in the touring party , was flooded with phone calls and letters . Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson 's tireless work would cause health problems and that \" it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through \" . Wisden said \" Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager , Mr Keith Johnson , hard-working and always genial ... Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players , Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour . \" Bradman said that \" no side could have wished for a better manager \" . = = Bradman 's role = = Bradman 's position as a selector gave him more power than previous Australian captains , who did not have an explicit vote in team selection . This was further magnified by Bradman being a member of the Board of Control while still an active player , a threefold combination that he alone has occupied in Australian cricket history . According to Haigh , he \" was the dominant figure in Australian cricket \" , and an \" unimpeachable figure \" . At the age of 40 , Bradman was by four years the oldest player on the team ; three quarters of his team were 32 or younger , and some viewed him as a father figure . Bradman wrote that this was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days , as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed . He wrote : Knowing the personnel , I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for . A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned , who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice , follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs ... there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do . The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment . However , some players expressed displeasure at Bradman 's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition . Miller deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball for a duck in a protest against Australia 's world record of 721 runs in one day against Essex . He also deplored Bradman 's hard-nosed attitude in fixtures nominally designated as \" festival matches \" . Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability , Miller played with reckless aggression , rather than a measured style in line with his captain 's aim of remaining undefeated . Bradman 's letters in later life , published posthumously , revealed his hostility towards Miller . Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence \u2014 one of the reserve batsmen \u2014 to partake in meaningful matchplay due to captain 's reluctance to risk Australia 's unbeaten run . = = Roles and strategy = = As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , sometimes amounting to six days of cricket a week \u2014 Sunday was always a rest day \u2014 Australia employed a rotation policy in order to allow the players to recuperate , except for the Tests and matches against Worcestershire , the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Leveson-Gower 's XI , when they chose their strongest team . As a result , no member of the squad \u2014 Bradman included \u2014 played in more than 23 of the first-class matches . Thus , the vice-captain Hassett led the Australians in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested , and maintained the unbeaten run in all of them . Wisden opined that \" in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders \" . Likewise , the batting was regularly rotated . The three openers Barnes , Morris and Brown took turns sitting out , while the middle-order was changed frequently and the wicket-keeping duties divided between Tallon and Saggers . Australia 's bowling attack was led by Lindwall and Miller , who took the new ball in the Tests . Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball . English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs ; at the time , the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored , something that usually took longer than 55 overs . The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians , as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack . Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs . As a result , Australia 's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs , and the left arm seamer Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign . The new ball rule also meant that spin bowling was less effective in the Tests , so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests , off spinner Johnson , until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring . Together they took only eight wickets . Things were different in the county matches . As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests , he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches , and the three spinners Ring , Johnson and McCool did more of the work , especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests . Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests , despite not being in Bradman 's first-choice team . Bradman even used Hamence , a reserve batsman , to open the bowling at times , in order to rest his bowlers , and in the second match against Yorkshire , decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win , so that his bowlers could recuperate . = = Ashes Test matches = = The five-Test Ashes series was won convincingly by Australia 4 \u2013 0 . England was captained by Norman Yardley and their batting was strong on paper , the first four in the order generally being Len Hutton , Cyril Washbrook , Bill Edrich and Denis Compton . They were supported by the likes of Joe Hardstaff junior , Tom Dollery , Charlie Barnett , Jack Crapp , John Dewes , Allan Watkins , Yardley and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans . However , they found the fast bowling trio of Lindwall , Miller and Johnston \u2014 supported by the medium pace of Toshack \u2014 a real handful , especially with the 55-over new ball rule . Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers , with high pace and the ability to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen . Prior to World War II , pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body . England were yet to develop similar bowlers , and as a result , Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation . At one stage , the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton , something that provoked great controversy . Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece , at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively , while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15 . For England , the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton , who scored 562 runs at 62.44 . Washbrook ( 356 runs at 50.85 ) was the only other player to average beyond 45 . In contrast , Australia 's batsmen had relatively little difficulty against the hosts ' attack . England 's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser and against a powerful Australian batting line-up he managed only 18 wickets at 38.22 . Alec Coxon , Dick Pollard , Edrich , Barnett and Yardley provided his seam support . Jim Laker , Jack Young , Eric Hollies and Doug Wright were the spinners in action . Bedser was the only English bowler to take more than nine wickets . Morris led the runscoring and century-making with 696 runs at 87.00 and three triple-figure scores , supported by Bradman ( 508 at 72.57 ) and Barnes ( 329 at 82.25 ) . With the first three batsmen in such form , Australia regularly made strong starts to their innings , averaging more than 120 for their first two wickets . The resounding Australian victories gave the England selectors many problems as they sought to find a combination that could challenge the tourists ' superiority . As a result , England used 21 players in all , while Australia only used 15 , one of which was forced by injury . Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests , while England only had seven such players . = = = First Test = = = Since the Second World War , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . Prior to the First Test , Australia had played 12 first-class matches , winning ten and drawing two . Eight of the victories were by an innings , and another was by eight wickets . It was thought that Bradman would play Ring , but he changed his mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast . Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The first innings set the pattern of the series as the England top-order struggled against Australia 's pace attack . Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather , but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton . During the interval , heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption . Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall . At 15 / 2 , Compton came in , and together with Edrich , they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter . Two balls later , Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring , leaving England at 46 / 4 . Two runs later , Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board . Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again . Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74 , England only had two wickets left . Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes . Both fell within two runs , ending England 's innings at 165 . Laker top-scored with 63 . Johnston ended with 5 / 36 , a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing . Miller took 3 / 38 and a catch . Australia 's openers Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes . Ideal batting conditions greeted the players on the second day . Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris . Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62 . Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker . Australia scored slowly , as Yardley employed leg theory to slow the scoring . Brown came in at No. 5 , but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24 . Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293 / 4 , a lead of 128 . Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes , with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes . It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs . On the third morning , Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg . Johnson and Tallon came and went , failing to pass 21 . The scoring was slow during this passage of play \u2014 Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs . Lindwall came out to bat at 365 / 7 and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket . Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting . Both fell in quick succession , but Australia 's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509 , leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead . Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners , with Young ( 1 / 79 ) and Laker ( 4 / 138 ) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively . Bedser bowled 44.2 overs , taking 3 / 113 . At the start of England 's second innings , Washbrook and Edrich fell early , leaving England at 39 / 2 . This brought together England 's leading batsmen , Hutton and Compton , who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day . Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon , delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day . One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd . The English had the better of the late afternoon period , scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes . Hutton resumed on 63 and he and Compton progressed before the light deteriorated and a thunderstorm stopped proceedings . Shortly after the resumption , Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions , ending a 111-run partnership at 150 / 3 . The innings was then repeatedly interrupted by poor light . Wisden opined that \" rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day \" . Hardstaff supported Compton in a partnership of 93 before being removed by Toshack , and Barnett followed soon after at 264 / 5 . Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge , aided by a 57-run partnership with his captain before Johnston dismissed Yardley for 22 . England reached stumps at 345 / 6 , just one run ahead , with Compton on 154 . Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning , which was briefly interrupted twice by rain . After the resumption , Compton was out hit wicket for 184 after attempting to hook Miller . He had batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours . Wisden opined that \" No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side 's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances \" . Compton 's fall at 405 / 7 exposed the bowlers and Australia quickly finished off the innings within half an hour . England finished at 441 , leaving Australia a target of 98 . Lindwall 's absence meant that the remaining four frontline bowlers had to bowl more than 32 overs each \u2014 Johnston bowled 59 and ended with 4 / 147 while Miller took 4 / 125 from 44 overs . Australia progressed steadily to 38 before Bedser bowled Morris for nine and then dismissed Bradman for a duck , again caught by Hutton at short fine leg . This left Australia 48 / 2 . Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss . Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries . = = = Second Test = = = Australia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge . On the other hand , England made three changes ; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox of Young , all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5.batsman . Following his injury in the previous Test , Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman , who gambled on his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat . Miller played , but was unfit to bowl . Barnes fell for a duck , and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings , slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser . In the meantime , Morris , after a slow start , made 105 runs out of a total of 166 scored while he was at the wicket , including 14 fours and one six . His innings was noted for powerful , well-placed cover drives . His dismissal left Australia at 166 / 3 , quickly followed by Miller , left Australia at 173 / 4 . Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly , taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run . Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225 / 6 . Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258 / 7 . Australia 's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning . Tallon batted on , supported by Johnston and Toshack , who scored their highest Test scores . Australia 's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston \u2014 who scored 29 . Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston fell . Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers , ending with 4 / 100 from 43 overs , while debutant Coxon took 2 / 90 from 35 overs . Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball . He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over . Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32 / 2 . Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later . England were 46 / 4 and Australia were firmly in control . Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings , scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes . After the tea break , Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball . Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53 . One run later , Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134 / 6 with their skipper dismissed for 44 . Johnson then removed Evans for nine , before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket . After 85 minutes of resistance , Johnston removed both . England 's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9 / 207 . On the third morning , Lindwall removed Bedser , ending England 's innings at 215 , giving Australia a 135 first innings lead . Lindwall ended with 5 / 70 . The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings . Barnes was given an early life and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122 before Morris was bowled for 62 . Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket . Barnes accelerated after reaching his half-century . Once he reached his century , Barnes became particularly aggressive . He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs , including two successive sixes before finally falling for 141 , caught on the boundary from Yardley . He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings . The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296 / 2 after 277 minutes when he departed . Hassett was bowled first ball , so Miller came to the crease at 296 / 3 to face Yardley 's hat-trick ball . Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball . Bradman fell to Bedser again , this time for 89 . Brown joined Miller at 329 / 4 and Australia reached stumps at 343 , without further loss . After the rest day , the fourth morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages . In 88 minutes of play , Australia added a further 117 runs . Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run partnership with Miller , who was out for 74 , followed by Lindwall for 25 . Bradman declared with Australia at 460 / 7 , 595 runs ahead . Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers , with two each . Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch , and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball , troubling the English batsmen . Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times . Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42 , before Hutton edged Lindwall and was out for 13 . Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65 / 3 . However , Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106 / 3 . The final day started poorly for England , with Compton being caught off Johnston from the second ball of the day . Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over . Eight runs later , Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall bouncer that stayed low . Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141 / 8 . England were bowled out for 186 , ceding a 409-run victory . Toshack ended the innings with 5 / 40 , while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively . The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were \u00a3 43,000 \u2014 a record for a Test in England . = = = Third Test = = = When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short-pitched bowling . The omission generated considerable controversy. and the Australians were pleased , feeling that Hutton was England 's best batsman . Hutton 's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett . England made three further changes . Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department . Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp . Australia dropped Brown , who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings , for the all rounder Loxton . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The change in England 's opening pair did not result in better results . A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball , and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that helped the bowlers . Both fell early , leaving England 28 / 2 . Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves . Compton attempted to hook a Lindwall bouncer , but edged it into his face . This forced him to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33 / 2 . Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting , resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added . They reached lunch at 57 / 2 . Upon the resumption , Crapp accelerated , hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson . Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37 . Dollery then fell for one . England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97 / 4 . After 170 minutes of slow batting , Edrich fell to Lindwall . At 119 / 5 , Compton returned to the field , his wound having been stitched . Yardley fell for 22 with the score at 141 / 6 , bringing Evans to the crease . Compton and Evans added 75 runs , before Lindwall removed the latter to leave England at 216 / 7 . England resumed on the second day at 231 / 7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball . Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes , adding 37 and featuring in a 121-run partnership with Compton . Soon after , Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes , who was standing at short leg , forcing him into hospital . The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363 . Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting , having struck 16 fours . Lindwall took 4 / 99 and Johnston 3 / 67 . Barnes 's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener . Johnson was deployed as Australia 's makeshift second opener , but made only one , and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13 / 2 . Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings , adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell . Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126 / 3 at stumps . Australia had added only nine runs on the third morning when Miller fell for 31 . Four runs later , Morris fell for 51 , leaving Australia 139 / 5 . Barnes came in , despite having collapsed in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow to his chest . He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital . Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell . Lindwall came into bat at 172 / 6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on . Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled , leaving Australia 208 / 7 , five runs behind the follow-on mark . Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221 , giving England a lead of 142 runs . During his innings , Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich . One of the short-pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand , evoking cheers from the crowd . Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers , taking 4 / 81 and 3 / 53 respectively . Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at the start of the second innings , bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease . Lindwall did not bounce Edrich , but Miller did , earning the ire of the crowd . Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes . This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook . Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six , but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit . Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball , as England reached 174 / 3 at the close , with Washbrook unbeaten on 85 . The rest day was followed by the fourth day , which was abandoned due to persistent rain . Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day , leaving Australia a victory target of 317 , but the rain meant that the entire first session was lost . The tourists batted in a defensive manner to ensure a draw . They ended at 92 / 1 in 61 overs . Morris finished unbeaten on 54 , his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series . The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test . = = = Fourth Test = = = Australia made two changes for the Test . Harvey replaced the injured Barnes , while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps . England made three changes . Emmett was dropped and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position . Laker replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young . Dollery , who had made only 38 in three innings , was replaced by all-rounder Cranston . England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch . Hutton and Washbrook put on an opening partnership of 168 , the best by England in the series . Washbrook refrained from the hook shot , which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series . The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall . Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich , the pair batted until late in the first day , when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day . His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs . Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268 / 2 , with Edrich on 41 . The next day , Bedser batted on in steady support of Edrich . The pair saw England to lunch without further loss , and 155 runs were added for the third wicket before Bedser was out after almost three hours of batting for 79 . Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes . Edrich fell three runs later at 426 / 4 for 111 . With two new batsmen at the crease , Australia quickly made further inroads to leave England at 473 / 6 . Loxton then successively removed Cranston , Evans and Laker as England fell from 486 / 6 to 496 / 9 , before Miller bowled Yardley to end England 's innings at 496 . The home team had lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs . Loxton took 3 / 55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two . Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury . With Barnes injured , Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris . Morris fell for six , before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63 / 1 . Bradman did the majority of the scoring , finishing unbeaten on 31 . On the third morning , England made the ideal start when Pollard removed Hassett for 13 and Bradman for 33 in the same over . This left Australia struggling at 68 / 3 . Harvey , playing his first Ashes Test , joined Miller at the crease . Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner \" Let 's get stuck into ' em \" . If England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a substantial lead . The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead with many lofted boundaries . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker . Miller was dismissed by Yardley for 58 while attempting another six , but the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , prompting Wisden to liken it to a \" hurricane \" . Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The high rate of scoring during the innings freed the match from England 's firm control . Loxton was particularly severe on Laker , lifting his deliveries into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours . At the other end , Harvey and Johnson fell to Laker in quick succession to leave the score at 329 / 6 . Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson , and 15 runs later , Yardley bowled Loxton for 93 , while Saggers only managed five , leaving Australia at 355 / 8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He was the last man out at 458 , leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3 / 92 . Laker took 3 / 113 , while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each . England set about extending their first innings lead for the remainder of the fourth day . For the second time in the match , Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership . Washbrook made 65 and Hutton 57 , leaving England at 129 / 2 . Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off , adding 103 before Lindwall trapped Edrich lbw for 54 . England lost wickets at regular intervals late in the day to be 278 / 6 . When Johnston removed Compton for 66 , England were 7 / 293 with no recognised batsmen remaining , having lost 4 / 33 . Wicket-keeper Evans led a rearguard action as England reached 362 / 8 at the close of the fourth day . England batted on for five minutes on the final morning , adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365 / 8 , with Evans on 47 not out . Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures , with 4 / 95 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin . This left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce . Only 44 runs came in the first hour . Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton 's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57 . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack ; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton 's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121 / 1 . In the half hour preceding the interval , Australia had added 64 runs . Both had given chances , but England fumbled them . Upon resumption , Morris severely attacked Compton , who had been bowling in an attempt to exploit the spin , aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs . This prompted Yardley to take the new ball . Australia reached 202 , halfway to the required total , with 165 minutes left . Morris passed his century , and was then dropped on 126 . Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity . Australia reached tea at 288 / 1 with Morris on 150 . The pair had added 167 during the session . Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182 , having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes . He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting . This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required . He fell with eight runs still needed . Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs . Australia had won by seven wickets , setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase , with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours . The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds . The attendance remains a record for a Test in England . = = = Fifth Test = = = With the series already lost , England made four changes to their team . Dewes replaced the injured Washbrook , while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder . Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut . England played two spinners ; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker , while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard 's pace . The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes . Australia made three changes . Off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring . Australia 's second change was forced on them ; the injured seamer Toshack was replaced by the recovered batsman Barnes . The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury . The match saw Lindwall at his best . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch . Precipitation during the week meant that the start of the Test was delayed until the afternoon . The humid conditions , along with the rain , assisted the bowlers , with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights . Miller bowled Dewes for one with his second ball to leave England at 2 / 1 , before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10 / 2 . Lindwall dismissed Compton after Morris had taken a diving catch , and Miller then removed Crapp , who failed to score in his 23-ball innings , leaving England at 23 / 4 . After the lunch break , England had struggled to 35 / 4 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . The debutant Watkins then batted for 16 balls without scoring before Johnston dismissed him for a duck to leave England at 42 / 6 . Watkins also collected a bruise on the shoulder that inhibited his bowling later in the match . Lindwall then removed Evans , Bedser and Young , all yorked in the space of two runs . The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket-keeper Tallon , who grasped the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left . In his post-lunch spell , Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs , taking five wickets for eight runs , finishing with 6 / 20 in 16.1 overs . Bradman described the spell as \" the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket \" . Hutton was the only batsman to resist , scoring 30 in 124 minutes from 147 deliveries . No other player passed seven . Miller and Johnston took 2 / 5 and 2 / 20 respectively , and Ring was not needed to bowl . In contrast , Australia batted with apparent ease , and Morris and Barnes passed England 's first innings total by themselves . The score had reached 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61 , ending a partnership that had taken only 126 minutes . This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day . As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level , the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once . The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat . Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers . With 6996 Test career runs , he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket , but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly . Hassett came in at 117 / 2 and Australia closed at 153 / 2 . Morris was unbeaten on 77 . On the second morning , Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett 's fall for 37 . The following four batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20 . Morris was finally removed for 196 , ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving ; it took a run out to remove Morris . Australia were eventually out for 389 . Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies , who took 5 / 131 . England had relied heavily on spin ; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners . England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears . Lindwall made the early breakthrough , and Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the innings to close at the end of the second day on 54 / 1 . Early on the third day , Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 , before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes . On 39 , Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall . Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64 , having top-scored in both innings , to leave England at 153 / 4 . Thereafter , England collapsed in the fading light , . prompting the umpires to call off play . The ground was then hit by rain , resulting in a premature end to the day 's play . England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178 / 7 . England resumed on the fourth morning and Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs . Johnston ended with 4 / 40 and Lindwall 3 / 50 . This result sealed the series 4 \u2013 0 in favour of Australia . The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches . = = Other matches in Great Britain = = = = = v Worcestershire = = = At Worcester , 28 , 29 , 30 April . Worcestershire ( 233 and 212 ) lost to the Australians ( 462 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 17 runs . The pitch was slow , and the weather was cold and showery for the traditional tour opener against Worcestershire . Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than \u20a4 4000 . The hosts elected to bat , and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137 / 1 after 133 minutes . However , the dismissal of Charles Palmer , who top-scored with 85 , precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233 . Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets , with Johnson taking 3 / 52 . In their sole innings , Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris ( 138 ) and Bradman ( 107 ) . This took them to 265 / 1 , before they declared at 462 / 8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time . Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6 / 135 for the locals . In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs , with 70 minutes to spare . McCool took 4 / 29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets . = = = v Leicestershire = = = At Leicester , 1 , 3 , 4 May . The Australians ( 448 ) defeated Leicestershire ( 130 and 147 ) by an innings and 171 runs . Australia elected to bat , and Miller , who had been promoted to No. 3 , shared century partnerships with Barnes ( 78 ) and Bradman ( 81 ) . A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack , but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century . He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448 . The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler , taking 5 / 91 . Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings ; another Australian expatriate , Jack Walsh , top-scored with 33 . Ring took 5 / 34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs . Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced the prospect of being bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5 / 83 . After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day ; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat . Johnson ended with 7 / 42 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Bradford , 5 , 6 May . Yorkshire ( 71 and 89 ) lost to the Australians ( 101 and 63 / 6 ) by four wickets . This low-scoring game was the closest that Australia came to defeat on the tour . The game was played in cold , blustery , overcast and wet conditions that suited spin bowlers . Yorkshire made only 71 in their first innings . Miller mixed medium-paced off-breaks with his fast bowling and this combination returned him 6 / 42 . At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4 / 22 from 26 overs . Together the pair bowled almost unchanged , delivering 49.3 of 54.3 overs . Australia struggled in reply and stumps were called when they fell to 4 / 38 . Miller came in at the start of the second day 's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added , before falling at 7 / 86 , part of a collapse of 5 / 27 . He hit two sixes in his innings , including one from the first ball that he faced , feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions . Australia ended at 101 , and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury . Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire , 6 / 51 . Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings , which followed a similar pattern to their first effort . Wickets fell steadily as Johnston ( 6 / 18 ) and Miller ( 3 / 49 ) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs . Australia were set a target of 60 runs for victory , and Hassett elected to not have the pitch rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett \" might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch \" . Hassett and Hamence both fell with the score on 20 to leave Australia five down . Australia slumped to 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Loxton incapacitated by injury , but scraped home without further loss with Harvey and Tallon at the crease . Harvey was given two chances , once when he was on one , and Tallon was also missed . It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912 , but Harvey won the game with a straight drive over the fence . Wickets had fallen at less than 10 runs apiece , and at the rate of every four overs . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 8 , 10 , 11 May . The Australians ( 632 ) defeated Surrey ( 141 and 195 ) by an innings and 296 runs . Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for the opening stand before the latter fell for 65 . Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket . Barnes ' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes . After Bradman departed at 403 / 3 , wickets began to fall more regularly , but Hassett held up his end and made 110 , while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50 . Surrey 's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4 / 104 . On the second afternoon , Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings . Johnson took 5 / 53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out , but received little support , the next highest scores being 15 and 10 . Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day . They made continual inroads on the final day , and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win . Johnston took 4 / 40 and Johnson 3 / 40 . = = = v Cambridge University = = = At Fenner 's , Cambridge , 12 , 13 , 14 May . Cambridge University ( 167 and 196 ) lost to the Australians ( 414 / 4 declared ) by an innings and 51 runs . Cambridge elected to bat and wickets fell regularly . No player made over 33 and the hosts were out in the second session of the first day for 167 . Miller was prominent with the ball and in the field , taking 5 / 46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers . In reply , Australia were already 184 / 1 at stumps , with Brown heading for a consecutive century . He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence , who made 92 . Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter , prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414 / 4 , having reached 61 not out himself . In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool , who took 7 / 78 as the match ended early on the third morning . Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000 . = = = v Essex = = = At Southend , 15 , 17 May . The Australians ( 721 ) defeated Essex ( 83 and 187 ) by an innings and 451 runs . After electing to bat , Australia made history on the first day by breaking the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day . Ironically , it was the only time they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour . With centuries from Brown ( 153 ) , Bradman ( 187 ) , Loxton ( 120 ) and Saggers ( 104 * ) , Australia 's first innings totalled 721 ; they were dismissed on the close of the first day 's play . Bradman 's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown 's 153 lasted three hours ; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145 / 1 . Bradman came in and seized the initiative , reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch , including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore . Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364 / 2 only halfway through the day 's play . Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia 's merciless crushing of their hosts , something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman . Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had wanted to go to the local horse races , but this was refused by Bradman . The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest , but still did not get to go to the races . Later , Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket , before an late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5 / 57 , leaving Saggers unbeaten , but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career . After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen on the first day , Essex made only 83 in their first innings , capitulating within 37 overs . Toshack took 5 / 31 and Miller 3 / 14 , and Australia enforced the follow-on . Essex 's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46 / 6 . However , a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187 . Johnson ended with 6 / 37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day . The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record . = = = v Oxford University = = = At Oxford , 19 , 20 , 21 May . The Australians ( 431 ) defeated Oxford University ( 185 and 156 ) by an innings and 90 runs . Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss , and the opening pair of Brown and Morris put on 139 . Brown scored his third century in succession , before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108 . Morris , Loxton , McCool and Ring all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431 . Oxford 's best batting performance came in the form of a 75-run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings , resisting the spin bowlers on the dry wicket . Despite Kardar 's innings of 54 and 29 , the top-score in both innings , Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily . The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists ; Toshack took three in each innings , while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match . = = = v Marylebone Cricket Club = = = At Lord 's , 22 , 24 , 25 May . The Australians ( 552 ) defeated Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) ( 189 and 205 ) by an innings and 158 runs . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and with two other capped players , were basically a full strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first-choice team . Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage . After winning the toss , Australia batted first . After the loss of Morris early , Barnes ( 81 ) and Bradman ( 98 ) set about regaining the ascendancy with a 160-run stand . Bradman scored eleven fours in his 98 , which took two hours , and Hassett then took over and added 51 . Miller then saw Australia to stumps at 407 / 5 . He continued the next day and Australia 's highest scorer with 163 , and Johnson supported him with 80 . Despite a collapse which saw the last five wickets fall for 54 runs following the pair 's departure , Australia reached 552 . Bradman 's batsmen gained a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests by attacking the off spin of Jim Laker . They hit nine sixes from the English Test representative on the second morning . Miller and Lindwall then sought to gain an advantage over England 's leading batsmen \u2014 Hutton and Compton \u2014 before the Tests . The MCC side , composed almost entirely of Test players , reached 91 / 2 , Toshack removed Compton and Hutton in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 104 / 5 . He took three more wickets to end with 6 / 51 as the MCC were eventually dismissed for 189 , conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs . Some English observers decried Toshack 's leg stump attack as being negative , but former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack 's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played . Bradman opted to enforce the follow on , and his spinners did most of the damage , McCool taking 4 / 35 and Johnson 3 / 37 . Only Len Hutton of the locals batsmen passed 26 during the match , scoring 52 and 64 , and Australia had taken a key psychological victory ahead of the Tests with an innings victory . The total attendance was 60,000 . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Manchester , 26 , 27 , 28 May . The Australians ( 204 and 259 / 4 ) drew with Lancashire ( 182 ) . The first day was abandoned due to rain . Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch . The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman 's wicket twice in the match , causing a media sensation . Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11 , the Australian captain 's first score on tour below 80 . The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40 . Australia looked set to concede a lead for the first time on tour as the hosts reached 3 / 129 , but Johnston ( 5 / 49 ) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire 's only innings , which ended on the third morning . With a result impossible , Australia had time for batting practice . Bradman reached 43 , and when Hilton came on , the Australian captain , perhaps perturbed by earlier events , attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack . After missing the first two balls , Bradman charged the third , swung and missed , fell over and was stumped . Harvey ( 76 * ) and Hamence ( 49 * ) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52 . = = = v Nottinghamshire = = = At Nottingham , 29 , 31 May 1 June . Nottinghamshire ( 179 and 299 / 8 ) drew with the Australians ( 400 ) . In Nottinghamshire 's first innings , Ray Lindwall took 6 / 14 from 15.1 overs , with only 10 scoring strokes being made off him . Reg Simpson made 74 and Joe Hardstaff junior 48 , but only one other batsman reached double figures . After their 98-run third-wicket stand was broken , Australia took 8 / 68 to bowl the hosts out for 179 . Lindwall , conceded less than a run per over . Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls . Fingleton said that Lindwall \" absolutely paralysed \" the batsmen , with some of his bowling \" in the real Larwood manner \" . Australia only batted once , and Brown top-scored with 122 in 3 hours 45 minutes , while Bradman added 86 . The Australia middle-order fell away and the tourists lost their last six wickets for 74 runs . In the county 's second innings , Keeton was hit in the chest by one of Lindwall 's deliveries and took no further part in the match . On the final day , Hardstaff hit the first century against the Australians on the tour , 107 , and Simpson again batted well , making 70 . Lindwall and the Australian pacemen were less incisive in the second innings , and Ring and Johnson took four and three wickets respectively . = = = v Hampshire = = = At Southampton , 2 , 3 , 4 June . Hampshire ( 195 and 103 ) lost to the Australians ( 117 and 182 / 2 ) by eight wickets . Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat against the Australians , who were led by Hassett while Bradman rested . The Australians were behind on the first innings for the first time on the tour and the match remained in the balance until the third afternoon . On a drying pitch , the hosts reached 116 / 3 before losing their remaining wickets for 79 to be all out for 195 , while Johnston took 6 / 74 . In reply , Australia fared worse and collapsed from 2 / 70 and made only 117 . Charles Knott 's off spin proved challenging for the Australians , but Miller scored three successive sixes from him before the collapse , top-scoring with 39 . In their second innings , both Miller and Johnston took five Hampshire wickets . John Arnold top-scored for the hosts in both innings , with 48 and 42 . Australia needed 182 runs in 175 minutes to win . Barnes went for a duck but Johnson , sent in five minutes before lunch , hit 74 out of a second-wicket partnership of 105 , including three sixes and seven fours . Brown , with 81 not out , and Hassett saw the Australians through to victory . = = = v Sussex = = = At Hove , 5 , 7 June . Sussex ( 86 and 138 ) lost to the Australians ( 549 / 5 declared ) by an innings and 325 runs . Lindwall won the match for the Australians with his bowling , taking 11 / 59 . After winning the toss , the Sussex batsmen struggled with his length and variation of pace , and he hit the off-stump five times in the first innings alone to end with 6 / 34 . Loxton also bowled well in the first innings , taking 3 / 13 . Australia replied to Sussex 's 86 strongly , and were already 254 / 1 by the end of the first day . Powered by Morris 's 184 and with centuries too for Bradman ( 109 ) and Harvey ( 100 * ) , Australia added a further 295 runs on the second day to declare at 549 / 5 . They then still had time to send down 63.3 overs , enough to finish the match within two days . In Sussex 's second innings Lindwall took two wickets in the first over . Harry Parks made 61 , but Sussex were all out for 138 , losing their last seven wickets for 59 . In all , eight of Lindwall 's wickets were bowled , five these by swinging yorkers , the batsmen unable to counter the swerving deliveries . Fingleton said that \" Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions \" as Sussex \" crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew \" . At the other end , Toshack helped to pin down the batsmen for Lindwall . He delivered 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs . = = = v Northamptonshire = = = At Northampton , 16 , 17 , 18 June . Northamptonshire ( 119 and 169 ) lost to the Australians ( 352 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 64 runs . Starting the day after the First Test , the Northamptonshire match was interrupted by rain . Northamptonshire batted first and collapsed to 7 / 61 before some tail-end resistance took them to 119 ; Johnston and Johnson took three wickets each . The Australians passed the locals ' score on the first afternoon , and their innings was built around Hassett 's 127 , which included 17 fours . Morris and McCool also made fifties . Northamptonshire made 169 runs in their second innings , Johnston and Ring taking four wickets each . In neither of the county innings did any player reach 50 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Sheffield , 19 , 21 , 22 June . The Australians ( 249 and 285 / 5 declared ) drew with Yorkshire ( 206 and 85 / 4 ) . The Australians were made to work hard for their 249 , with only Bradman reaching 50 . Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores . Alec Coxon took 4 / 66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test . Yorkshire made 206 in reply , Toshack taking 7 / 81 and Johnston 3 / 101 : together , they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings . Like the Australians , the local batsmen struggled to make the most of their starts ; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40 . Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test , Bradman declared Australia 's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining . Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86 , putting on 154 for the second wicket . Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to the upper half of the order in the second innings . The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result . Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw . The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 30 June , 1 \u2013 2 July . Surrey ( 221 and 289 ) lost to The Australians ( 389 and 122 / 0 ) by 10 wickets . Australia won the toss and sent Surrey in to bat . They made 221 , and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort in which there were six single-figure scores . As the match started the day after the Second Test , Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers , and Ring took three wickets , while the Test players only took two in total . Hamence opened the batting for Australia \u2014 Brown injured a finger while fielding \u2014 but he was out for a duck . Hassett ( 139 ) and Bradman ( 128 ) then put on 231 , Bradman making his sixth century of the tour . However , the Australians lost wickets steadily thereafter to be all out for 389 . Surrey made 289 in their second innings , with McCool taking 6 / 113 after bowling more than 40 % of the overs . The hosts batted steadily with three fifties , but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised . The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time . = = = v Gloucestershire = = = At Bristol , 3 , 5 , 6 July . The Australians ( 774 / 7 declared ) defeated Gloucestershire ( 279 and 132 ) by an innings and 363 runs . The Australians elected to bat and made the highest score of the tour , and it was also the second biggest score by an Australian team in England ( the 1893 team made 843 against a \" Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present \" at Portsmouth ) , and the highest score by an Australian team versus an English county . Morris 's 290 , made from 466 balls in five hours , was the highest individual score of the tour , and he featured in century stands with Barnes , Miller and Harvey . Loxton made 159 not out , Harvey 95 and McCool 76 . This match preceded the Third Test , and off spinner Tom Goddard was regarded as a candidate for England selection after strong performances in county cricket . However , Morris and Loxton 's aggressive attack gave Goddard figures of 0 / 186 from 32 overs , effectively ending his chances of selection . Former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \" Tom [ Goddard ] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [ shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking ] to him and that gets him many wickets . \" Instead , it was Loxton who forced his way into the Third Test . Gloucestershire replied with an innings of 279 , in which Jack Crapp made 100 not out , while Johnson took 6 / 68 . Made to follow on during the final day , the hosts made only 132 , losing their last eight wickets for 60 . Johnson took 5 / 32 to end with 11 / 100 for the match , while Ring took 5 / 47 to end with seven for the match .

Denis Compton hit a cautious 62 , but Middlesex lost wickets regularly to fall from 1 / 78 to 203 all out . Five bowlers shared the wickets , Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece . At one stage , Australia were 53 / 3 , but Morris ( 109 ) and Loxton ( 123 ) put on a partnership of 172 . No other batsman bettered Hamence 's 30 , and Jim Sims took 6 / 65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46 . Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings , with only John Dewes ( 51 ) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists , while eight managed only single figures . Five bowlers shared the wickets , and McCool was the only one to take three . McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs . = = = v Derbyshire = = = At Derby , 28 , 29 , 30 July . The Australians ( 456 ) defeated Derbyshire ( 240 and 182 ) by an innings and 34 runs . The Australians chose to bat first , and Brown top scored with 140 , his first 50 taking three hours . He shared century stands with Bradman , who made 62 , and Miller ( 57 ) . Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away late in the innings , losing 7 / 142 . Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57 , while Miller , Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece . The county followed on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs . In their second innings they made 182 , with Denis Smith making 88 , the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians . However , only one other player reached double figures , as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9 / 72 , taking 6 / 77 , while Loxton took 3 / 16 . There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17,000 on the first day . = = = v Glamorgan = = = At Swansea , 31 July , 2 \u2013 3 August . Glamorgan ( 197 ) drew with the Australians ( 215 / 3 ) . Rain prevented play after 3pm on the second day . No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197 , with the four Australian bowlers , Lindwall , Miller , Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets . The Australians ' 215 / 3 was based on an aggressive 84 from Miller , with five sixes and seven fours , and a partnership of 126 with stand-in Hassett , who was 71 not out when the rain came . The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50,000 . = = = v Warwickshire = = = At Birmingham , 4 , 5 , 6 August . Warwickshire ( 138 and 155 ) lost to the Australians ( 254 and 41 / 1 ) by nine wickets . Bradman put Warwickshire in to bat on a wet pitch and the hosts struggled to 138 in an innings that lasted almost 80 overs . Martin Donnelly ( 28 ) was the only batsman to pass 20 , and Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets each . Australia scored 254 in reply ; Hassett top-scored with 68 , Lindwall made 45 , and the pair 's partnership of 70 was the highest of the match . Three other batsmen reached 30 , but most of the Australians were uncomfortable against the leg spin of Eric Hollies , who opened the bowling and took 8 / 107 , the best innings analysis against the Australians on the whole tour . This performance earned the Warwickshire bowler a call-up for the fifth and final Test . In their second innings Warwickshire made 155 runs , Johnston and McCool taking four wickets each , the former conceding only 32 from 39 overs . Australia made the required 41 by lunch on the third day . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Old Trafford , Manchester , 7 , 9 , 10 August . The Australians ( 321 and 265 / 3 declared ) drew with Lancashire ( 130 and 199 / 7 ) . Cyril Washbrook 's benefit match brought him a then record sum , \u00a3 14,000 , but it was a mixed experience because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test . The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes ( 67 ) reaching 50 . Nine of the Australians made a start , reaching 14 , but could not capitalise on their opportunities , and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123 . The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6 / 73 . Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38 , while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece , but the Australians did not enforce the follow on . Australia made 265 / 5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133 , his highest at Old Trafford , with 90 for Barnes . Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match , but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day . Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers . Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller , who refused to bowl , saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century . Lindwall ( 4 / 27 ) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century . = = = v Durham = = = At Sunderland , 11 , 12 August . The Australians ( 282 ) drew with Durham ( 73 / 5 ) . In the absence of the resting Bradman , Hassett won the toss and elected to bat . Attendance was 17,000 on the first day of this two-day non-first-class match . Rain prevented any play on the second day . After a poor start that saw them fall to 22 / 3 , McCool ( 64 ) and Miller ( 55 ) made half-centuries for the Australians . Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20 , but none went on . Paceman Keith Jackson took 5 / 76 for the hosts . Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match . = = = v Kent = = = At Canterbury , 21 , 23 August . The Australians ( 361 ) defeated Kent ( 51 and 124 ) by an innings and 186 runs . Australia elected to bat first and Brown made 106 , while Bradman ( 65 ) and Harvey ( 60 ) both scored half-centuries . Kent collapsed to the lowest score of the tour in the first innings , succumbing in only 23 overs . Johnston and Loxton both took 3 / 10 , and six local batsmen made ducks . Forced to follow on , half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings . Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71 , but the match , held in front of record crowds for the ground , ended inside two days , soon after Evans was run out . It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets . Lindwall took 4 / 37 in the second innings ; all his wickets were top-order batsmen . = = = v Gentlemen of England = = = At Lord 's , 25 , 26 , 27 August . The Australians ( 610 / 5 declared ) defeated the Gentlemen of England ( 245 and 284 ) by an innings and 81 runs . In his last match at Lord 's , Bradman won the toss and made his ninth century ( 150 ) of the tour against a side composed almost entirely of Test players . Brown ( 120 ) and Hassett ( 200 * ) also scored centuries , and Miller made 69 . Bradman elected to bat into the second day . The Gentlemen responded with 242 of which Reg Simpson made 60 and , following on , 284 , with Bill Edrich making 128 . There were no other scores beyond 30 in either innings . Ring took 5 / 70 for the innings and eight for the match , while Johnson secured seven wickets . The Victorian spin duo bowled the majority of the overs in both innings . = = = v Somerset = = = At Taunton , 28 , 30 August . The Australians ( 560 / 5 declared ) defeated Somerset ( 115 and 71 ) by an innings and 374 runs . After winning the toss , the Australians made all their runs on the first day , with centuries for Hassett ( 103 ) , Harvey ( 126 ) and Johnson ( 113 * ) and 99 for Hamence . The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket , through Hassett and Barnes , who was replaced by Harvey after retiring ill . The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries , and were keen to see Hamence do the same . The rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone , only to see him stumped for 99 , his highest score for the season . On the Monday , the second day , on a pitch that was taking spin , Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total . McCool took 4 / 21 and 4 / 23 , and Johnston also took eight , including 5 / 34 in the second innings . He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner , and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls . = = = v South of England = = = At Hastings , 1 , 2 , 3 September . The Australians ( 522 / 7 declared ) drew with the South of England ( 298 ) . The tourists elected to bat and after losing the openers early , Hassett top scored with 151 , his third consecutive century . He was supported by Bradman ( 143 ) and Harvey ( 110 ) , whose quick scoring enabled the Australians to declare with a large total . Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman and Harvey . Harvey 's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day . The second and third days were continually interrupted by rain , and Compton made 82 in the showers . Bradman gave his regular bowlers a light workload and Brown took 4 / 16 in 4.1 overs to finish off the tail , the only time he bowled in first-class matches on the entire tour . There was no time left for the second innings . = = = v HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI = = = At Scarborough , 8 , 9 , 10 September . HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI ( 177 and 75 / 2 ) drew with the Australians ( 489 / 8 declared ) . This was the final match for Bradman in England , and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions . It was Australia 's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches . During the last Australian campaign in 1938 , this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full-strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Ring . The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat , but Lindwall took 6 / 59 in an innings that lasted into the second day , bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs . Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively , sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62 . Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face , breaking his nose . Australia reached 2 / 407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8 / 469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result . Leveson-Gower 's XI played out time , with Bradman bowling the last over . = = = v Scotland = = = At Edinburgh , 13 , 14 September . The Australians ( 236 ) defeated Scotland ( 85 and 111 ) by an innings and 40 runs . The match against Scotland was a two-day fixture that did not have first-class status . Australia elected to bat and Morris top-scored with 112 , and McCool made 52 , but all struggled against the leg-spin of William Laidlaw , who took 5 / 51 . The Australians collapsed at the end , losing their last six wickets for 36 runs , and only three made double figures . Scotland collapsed against Johnston and Johnson , who took 6 / 15 and 3 / 18 respectively . Forced to follow on , a second innings opening stand of 50 preceded a second collapse , this time Ring and Morris took 4 / 20 and 5 / 10 . Only three Scottish players passed double figures in either innings . = = = v Scotland = = = At Aberdeen , 17 , 18 September . Scotland ( 178 and 142 ) lost to the Australians ( 407 / 6 declared ) by an innings and 87 runs . In another two-day non-first-class match , Scotland batted better than in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat , but still lost . Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts ' 178 , before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool , promoted to open , made 108 , while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5 . Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring . Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball , and the wickets were shared , with nobody taking more than four .",

P\u00e9rez also proposed the song to be covered by Mexican singer Luis Miguel for his album Segundo Romance ( 1994 ) .

Lasting for a duration of four minutes and twenty-five seconds , the song is one of two original ballads included on Merry Christmas II You . It encompasses a range of genres , including Christmas , adult contemporary , urban contemporary and religious music . The music and Carey 's vocals recorded by Brian Garten at several recording studios , which included Henson Studios and 20th Century Fox Scoring Stage in Los Angeles , Guardian Angel Studios Bel Air , Germano Studios New York City and Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood .

Mike Diver for BBC wrote that although the song is \" bogged down in sentiment \" , \" any unpleasantness in the mouth is soon washed clean by the arrival of that hit \" , while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone simply described the orchestration as \" gooey \" . Jack Foley of IndieLondon echoed Diver 's observation about its sentiment , writing that the \" more serious songs \" on the album such as \" One Child \" , \" Oh Come All Ye Faithful \" and \" Auld Lang Syne \" are \" stifling \" and makes the album an \" endurance test \" . He continued with \" Hence , Auld Lang Syne , One Child and Oh Come All Ye Faithful literally make your skin crawl and howling for the nearest slice of Linkin Park to add some musical grit to your life . \" The Village Voice writer Rich Juzwiak was critical of the song , describing it as a \" needless retelling \" of the birth of Jesus that does not add anything new or original to the story of his birth .

The latter originally appeared on the 1965 television special A Charlie Brown Christmas and the soundtrack of the same name . Also included are three original tracks , \" Redribbon Foxes \" , \" Winter White \" and \" Wish You Well \" . Of \" Redribbon Foxes \" , Sudol stated : ... when I was writing it , I was in a cabin covered with snow and it was very quiet outside . This was all in my head , of course . Down a hill there 's a little town , all lit up , carolers singing . It 's a little bit sad , although it 's very beautiful . There 's a little fox creeping through the snow , a fox that 's very hard to catch . Sudol stated that \" Winter White \" was the \" first genuinely heart-achy song \" she had ever written and revealed that \" Wish You Well \" is about a family member . According to Sudol , the group \" expand [ ed ] its sound \" by incorporating horns , mandolins and pedal steel guitars . The EP was recorded in five days at record producer David Bianco 's studio ( Dave 's Room ) in Los Angeles . She said of the recording process : We all holed up in ( producer ) David Bianco 's lovely studio , which was built in the ' 70s and hasn 't changed much since then \u2014 and though it was the sticky , hot LA summer outside , inside , it was snowy , delightful Christmastime .

Leahey complimented Sudol 's \" lilting , whimsical \" performance and mentioned that songs like \" Redribbon Foxes \" have a broader appeal . Brian Moore of RedEye , a daily publication put out by the Chicago Tribune , thought the EP contained both traditional and indie qualities and described Sudol 's voice as \" smooth , velvety and well-suited for holiday music \" . OffBeat 's Alex Rawls thought the EP was more \" wintry \" than \" Christmas-y \" , more melancholic than celebratory , and only \" Wish You Well \" evoked a warm , joyous tone . One reviewer for Skope Magazine described the collection as \" whimsical \" . \" Christmas Time Is Here \" in particular received positive critical reception . Moore and Rawls both considered the song to be the best track on the EP . Rawls called it the collection 's \" finest moment \" , having \" evocative sounds that swell and recede \" . Frye described the track as \" bone-chilling \" ; Brandon Ferguson of OC Weekly called it \" nostalgia-inducing \" . = = Track listing = = Track listing adapted from AllMusic . = = Personnel = = Credits adapted from AllMusic . = = Chart performance = = Oh Blue Christmas managed to chart in the United States , peaking at number 87 on the Billboard 200 , number three on Billboard 's Top Holiday Albums chart and number 28 on the Top Rock Albums chart .",

                    "text": "Pain in My Heart = Pain in My Heart is the debut album of soul singer-songwriter Otis Redding . Redding recorded for Volt Records , a subsidiary of Stax Records , based in Memphis , Tennessee . Volt LPs were initially issued on the Atco label , which released this album ( the singles were issued on the Volt label ) . The album includes four successful singles , released in 1962 and 1963 : \" These Arms of Mine \" , \" That 's What My Heart Needs \" , \" Security \" , and the title track . Since Billboard did not publish an R & B singles chart from late 1963 to early 1965 , the R & B chart peaks of the latter two singles are unknown . = = Biography = = As a member of the Pat T. Cake and the Mighty Panthers , Redding toured in the Southern United States , mostly on the chitlin ' circuit , a string of nightclubs and dance halls hospitable to African-American musicians when racial segregation of performance venues was prevalent . Guitarist Johnny Jenkins , who helped Redding win a talent contest at the Hillview Springs Social Club 15 times in row and also at the talent show \" The Teenage Party \" , left the band to become a featured artist with the Pinetoppers . Around this time , Redding met Phil Walden , the future founder of the recording company Phil Walden and Associates ( even though without an associate ) , and later Bobby Smith , who ran Confederate Records , a small label . He signed with Confederate and recorded his second single , \" Shout Bamalama \" ( a rewrite of his \" Gamma Lamma \" ) , with his band Otis and the Shooters . Wayne Cochran , the only solo artist signed to Confederate , became the Pinetoppers ' bass guitarist . At the same time , Walden started to look for a record label . Atlantic Records representative Joe Galkin was interested in working with Jenkins and around 1962 proposed to send him to the Stax studio in Memphis . On the way to a Pinetoppers studio session , Redding drove for Jenkins , as the latter did not have a driver 's license . Jenkins performed with Booker T. & the M.G. ' s , and when the session ended early , Redding received the opportunity to perform two songs . The first was \" Hey Hey Baby \" , but studio chief Jim Stewart thought it sounded too much like Little Richard . Next , he sang \" These Arms of Mine \" , which became his first single for Stax . After that performance , Redding was signed by Stax . = = Recording and release = = Pain in My Heart includes songs from Redding 's 1962 \u2013 1963 sessions . Stewart signed Redding for Stax and released Redding 's debut single , \" These Arms of Mine \" , with \" Hey Hey Baby \" on the B-side . \" These Arms of Mine \" was released by Volt , a subsidiary of Stax , in October 1962 , and charted in March the following year . It was one of his most successful songs , selling more than 800,000 copies . In the 1963 session , \" That 's What My Heart Needs \" and \" Mary 's Little Lamb \" were recorded and cut in June 1963 ; the latter became one of the worst-selling singles by Redding . Rob Bowman , in his book Soulsville , U.S.A. : The Story of Stax Records , wrote that in these two songs \" Otis sings with a harsh , impassioned gospel voice reminiscent of Archie Brownlee of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi \" and further reckoned the ending of the first would have made Redding \" a suberb gospel singer had he chosen to record in that idiom . \" \" That 's What My Heart Needs \" became Redding 's second single on Stax . The title track , recorded on September , the next year , sparked some copyright issues , as it sounded like Irma Thomas 's \" Ruler of My Heart \" . After a few months , \" Pain in My Heart \" , with the B-side \" Something Is Worrying Me \" , peaked at number 60 on Billboard 's Hot 100 chart . Rob Bowman observed that \" with ' Pain in My Heart , ' Otis 's dynamic control is front and center as he uses his voice as a horn , swelling and decreasing in volume , swallowing syllables and worrying the word ' heart . ' ... It was Otis 's most successful effort to date , commercially and aesthetically . \" The last single , \" Security \" , was released in April 1964 and reached number 97 on Billboard 's Hot 100 chart . According to Matthew Greenwald of Allmusic , the song is \" a stinging , up-tempo groover \" and \" showed Otis Redding stretching his funky rock & roll roots . Aided by the usual gang of Stax musicians , it 's one of his tightest early records .... [ T ] he song could have easily succeeded as an instrumental . \" The other tracks on the album are covers of popular songs , including \" The Dog \" , by Rufus Thomas ; \" Louie Louie \" , by Richard Berry ; \" Lucille \" , by Little Richard ; and \" Stand by Me \" , by Ben E. King . Despite the alleged copyright infringement , Pain in My Heart was released on Atlantic Records ' subsidiary Atco Records on January 1 , 1964 , and peaked at number 20 on Billboard 's R & B chart and at number 85 on Billboard 's Hot 100 . = = Reception = = Pain in My Heart received positive critical reception . Bruce Eder of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars , reckoning that the album \" was practically a road map to Mick Jagger and any number of other would-be white soul shouters in the UK \" , and finding elements of hard rock in \" Hey Hey Baby \" . He praised Redding 's version of \" You Send Me \" , considering it \" the least stylized of any of his renditions of [ Sam ] Cooke 's songs \" , but criticized Redding 's restraint , compared to future recordings , and the \" somewhat less than memorable \" writing , except on \" Security \" , \" These Arms of Mine \" and \" That 's What My Heart Needs \" . The reviewer concluded by saying \" Redding exudes astonishing power , energy and boldness \" . A review of several albums by Redding in Rolling Stone magazine observed that \" [ t ] he title track on [ Pain in My Heart ] set the pattern for all his ballads to come \u2014 Otis triumphed at rendering agony . Signs of the singer 's virtuosity are already apparent in the almost teasing way he lingers over some lyrics and spits out others ; virtually never would he sing a line the same way twice \" . The review gave the album 4 out of 5 stars . When Redding performed \" These Arms of Mine \" during his first session at Stax , witth Jenkins on guitar and Steve Cropper on piano , producer Jim Stewart praised his performance and noted , \" Everybody was fixin ' to go home , but Joe Galkin insisted we give Otis a listen . There was something different about [ the ballad ] . He really poured his soul into it . \" = = Track listing = = = = Musicians = = Otis Redding - vocals Booker T.

The tour supported her debut solo album , Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ) . Most of the songs on Live at Wembley originate from that album , but it also contains a medley of past songs by her former group Destiny 's Child and two soundtrack singles : \" Work It Out \" and \" Summertime \" . The second disc of Live at Wembley contains three previously unreleased studio recorded songs , including a cover of Rose Royce 's \" Wishing on a Star \" , and one remix each of \" Crazy in Love \" , \" Baby Boy \" and \" Naughty Girl \" . Behind-the-scenes footage can be also seen on the DVD . The concert audio was mixed by Rick Camp , the same engineer who mixed at the concert venues . It is uncommon for mix engineers to specialize in both live and recorded mixing . For Camp , \" Mixing Beyonc\u00e9 is a pleasure because she 's a real singer and makes it easy . There is hardly an overdub on this project \u2014 it 's 95 percent live Beyonc\u00e9 . \" He further talked about the collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9 with Mix magazine , saying : \" In my 22 years of mixing , I 've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does : vocally and her ability to do a show . I 've seen this young woman run across a 60-foot stage , hit every note and never miss a thing . And that makes my job so much easier . \" = = Show synopsis = = On stage , Beyonc\u00e9 was backed by several male and female dancers performing choreography during the show .

She introduces the next song \" Me , Myself and I \" saying that she wrote it for all the ladies , \" I thought it was something we all need to hear . When we get in these relationships they don 't work out . Sometimes we blame the man , we blame another girl , we blame ourselves . But I think we should take every experience and learn a lesson out of it , even the bad experiences and I want all the ladies to know that we will never disappoint ourselves . You 'll always have yourself . \" She introduces the next song \" Summertime \" as one of her favorite songs asking from the crowd to dance further performing a step dance while footage of flowers was projected on the screen .

                    "text": "West End Girls = \" West End Girls \" is a song by British pop duo Pet Shop Boys . Written by Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe , the song was released twice as a single . The song is influenced by hip hop music , with lyrics concerned with class and the pressures of inner-city life which were inspired partly by T. S. Eliot 's poem The Waste Land . It was generally well received by contemporary music critics and has been frequently cited as a highlight in the duo 's career . The first version of the song was produced by Bobby Orlando and was released on Columbia Records ' Bobcat Records imprint in April 1984 , becoming a club hit in the United States and some European countries . After the duo signed with EMI , the song was re-recorded with producer Stephen Hague for their first studio album , Please . In October 1985 , the new version was released , reaching number one in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1986 . In 1987 , the song won Best Single at the Brit Awards , and Best International Hit at the Ivor Novello Awards . In 2005 , 20 years after its release , the song was awarded Song of The Decade between the years 1985 and 1994 by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters . In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation 's 12th favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV . The song was performed by Pet Shop Boys at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and was included as part of the soundtrack of the 2013 game Grand Theft Auto V on the Non-Stop-Pop radio station . = = Background = = = = = Recording and production = = = In 1983 , Neil Tennant met producer Bobby Orlando , while on an assignment in New York interviewing Sting for Smash Hits . After listening to some demos , Orlando offered to produce for the duo . In 1983 \u2013 84 , the duo recorded eleven songs with Orlando , at Unique Studios in New York , \" West End Girls \" , \" Opportunities ( Let 's Make Lots of Money ) \" , \" One More Chance \" , \" I Want A Lover \" , \" A Man Could Get Arrested \" , \" I Get Excited \" , \" Two Divided by Zero \" , \" Rent \" , \" It 's A Sin \" , \" Pet Shop Boys \" , and \" Later Tonite \" . Orlando played most of the instruments on \" West End Girls \" , including the jazz riff at the end . Lowe played one chord and the bassline . It included a drum part lifted from Michael Jackson 's \" Billie Jean \" , and an arrangement involving what Tennant called \" Barry White chords \" . Orlando was thrilled by the song 's production ; his idea was to make a rap record in a British accent . In April 1984 , \" West End Girls \" was released , becoming a club hit in Los Angeles and San Francisco , and a minor dance hit in Belgium , and France , but was only available in the United Kingdom as a 12 \" import . In March 1985 , after long negotiations , Pet Shop Boys cut their contractual ties with Orlando , and hired manager Tom Watkins , who signed them with EMI . They re-recorded \" West End Girls \" with producer Stephen Hague , and re-released the song in late 1985 , topping the charts in both the UK and the U.S. In an interview on BBC4 's Synth Britannia programme ( Video on YouTube at 1h 21m 19s ) , Neil Tennant explains the role of the then new sampling technology on the track and how every single sound came from the newly introduced E-mu Emulator keyboard . = = = Music and lyrics = = = \" West End Girls \" is a synthpop song influenced by hip hop music . The song 's socially conscious streak , as well as the propulsive bass line , derives from Grandmaster Flash 's protest rap song \" The Message \" . Lowe and Hague created a \" snaky , obsessive rhythm punch \" for the music , replacing the song 's previously sparse beats and minimal keyboard lines . Tennant started to write the song when he was staying at his cousin 's house in Nottingham while watching a gangster film . Just when he was going to sleep he came up with the lines : \" Sometimes you 're better off dead , there 's a gun in your hand and it 's pointing at your head \" . The lyrics were inspired by T.S. Eliot 's poem The Waste Land , particularly in the use of different narrative voices and arcane references . The song 's lyrics are largely concerned with class , inner-city pressure . Tennant later said that some listeners had assumed the song referred to prostitutes , but was actually , \" about rough boys getting a bit of posh . \" The lyric \" From Lake Geneva to the Finland Station \" refers to the train route taken by Vladimir Lenin when he was smuggled by the Germans to Russia during World War I , a pivotal event in the Russian Revolution . Indeed , it is highly likely the lyric was inspired by the book To the Finland Station by Edmund Wilson , a very famous work on the history of revolutionary thought and Socialism that Tennant would have at least heard of , if not read , as a student . The Bobby Orlando-produced version of the single included another line , \" All your stopping , stalling and starting , / Who do you think you are , Joe Stalin ? \" which was removed for the 1985 version . = = Critical reception = = \" West End Girls \" has been generally well received by music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic in a review of the album Please called the song \" hypnotic \" , adding that \" it 's not only a classic dance single , it 's a classic pop single \" . In a review for the group 's second studio album Actually , Rob Hoerburger from Rolling Stone magazine commented that \" West End Girls \" was \" as catchy as anything on the radio in 1986 \" , praising \" its enticing bass line and foreboding synth riffs \" , but felt that it was almost \" nullified by peevish spoken asides and the cryptic posturing of the duo 's lyrics \" . In a review of the live album Concrete , Michael Hubbard from musicOMH said that \" West End Girls \" was one of the songs that \" round out a collection that never feels too long or superfluous \" , adding that it \" goes some way to installing Tennant and Lowe as national treasures \" . Nitsuh Abebe from Pitchfork Media , in a review of their compilation album PopArt : Pet Shop Boys - The Hits commented that in the song \" we meet Tennant not as a singer , but as a speaker \" , adding that \" he mumbles the verses to us not like a star , but like a stranger in a raincoat , slinking alongside you and pointing out the sights \" . In 1987 , \" West End Girls \" won for Best Single at The BRIT Awards , and for Best International Hit at the Ivor Novello Awards . In 2005 , the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters gave to West End Girls the Ivor Novello Award for Song of The Decade between the years 1985 and 1994 . = = Music video = = The video was directed by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson , and consists of shots of the duo around London . At the beginning of the video , noises from the city can be heard , a camera passes Lowe on the street , and focus on two vintage dolls in a shop window .

They stand in front of a red garage door , Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat , white shirt and dark necktie , directly addressing the camera , with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression . Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike . In other shots , Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind , as if one were a master and the other an apprentice . Then the video shows various shots at Waterloo station , as the chorus starts . In slow motion , the camera pans across the WHSmith shop on the station concourse as the duo walk past . It cuts to a brief shot of a No. 42 red double-decker bus , showing the destination as Aldgate , also advertising the stage-show Evita , then black and white shots of the Tower Bridge , Westminster and the Westminster Palace Clock Tower from the sky . The duo poses on the South Bank of the River Thames in a pastiche of a postcard image , with the Houses of Parliament as a background . The camera shows shots of young women , and passes through arcades and cinemas in Leicester Square . The camera now passes South Africa House showing protestors in the Non-Stop Picket , an anti-apartheid vigil . The video cuts to a closeup of Tennant singing the chorus , with a purple neon sign passing across his face . At the end the camera passes again through Leicester Square , where people queue to see Fletch and Desperately Seeking Susan .

In Canada , \" West End Girls \" first entered the RPM singles chart in April 1985 , reaching a peak position of 81 in June 1985 . Having signed with EMI , the group released their first major label single \" Opportunities ( Let 's Make Lots of Money ) \" in mid-1985 , but it failed to attract attention . The Pet Shop Boys then decided to re-record \" West End Girls \" , and issue this new version as a single . Producer Stephen Hague helmed the new , re-recorded version of \" West End Girls \" . The re-recorded version of \" West End Girls \" was released in the United Kingdom in October 1985 , debuting on the UK Singles Chart at number 80 , and within eight weeks of its release it had reached the top of the chart . It maintained the number one position for two weeks and received a gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) in January 1986 . Across Europe , \" West End Girls \" also topped the singles chart in Norway , as well as peaking in the top three in Belgium , Germany , Ireland , the Netherlands , Sweden , and Switzerland . In Canada , where the original recording of \" West End Girls \" had already been a minor hit in 1985 , the re-recorded version was issued as a single in early 1986 .

                    "text": "Neil Harvey = Robert Neil Harvey MBE ( born 8 October 1928 ) is a former Australian cricketer who represented the Australian cricket team between 1948 and 1963 , playing in 79 Test matches . He was the vice-captain of the team from 1957 until his retirement . An attacking left-handed batsman , sharp fielder and occasional off-spin bowler , Harvey was the senior batsman in the Australian team for much of the 1950s and was regarded by Wisden as the finest fielder of his era . Upon his retirement , Harvey was the second-most prolific Test run-scorer and century-maker for Australia . One of six cricketing brothers , four of whom represented Victoria , Harvey followed his elder brother Merv into Test cricket and made his debut in January 1948 , aged 19 and three months . In his second match , he became the youngest Australian to score a Test century , a record that still stands . Harvey was the youngest member of the 1948 Invincibles of Don Bradman to tour England , regarded as one of the finest teams in history . After initially struggling in English conditions , he made a century on his Ashes debut . Harvey started his career strongly , with six centuries in his first thirteen Test innings at an average over 100 , including four in 1949 \u2013 50 against South Africa , including a match-winning 151 not out on a sticky wicket . As Bradman 's team broke up in the 1950s due to retirements , Harvey became Australia 's senior batsman , and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1954 , in recognition of his feat in scoring more than 2,000 runs during the 1953 tour of England . In 1957 he was passed over for the captaincy and was named as the deputy of Ian Craig , who had played just six matches , as Australia sought to rebuild the team with a youth policy following a decline in the team . Craig later offered to demote himself due to poor form , but Harvey prevented him from doing so . Craig fell ill the following season , but Harvey moved interstate and Richie Benaud was promoted to the captaincy ahead of him . Harvey continued in the deputy 's role until the end of his career , and was captain for only one Test match . In the Second Test at Lord 's in 1961 , when Benaud was injured , Harvey led the team in the \" Battle of the Ridge \" on an erratic surface , grinding out a hard fought victory . Only Bradman had scored more runs and centuries for Australia at the time of Harvey 's retirement . Harvey was best known for his extravagant footwork and flamboyant stroke play , as well as his fielding . Harvey was particularly known for his innings in conditions unfavourable to batting , performing when his colleagues struggled , such as his 151 not out in Durban , his 92 not out in Sydney in 1954 \u2013 55 and his 96 on the matting in Dhaka . In retirement , he became a national selector for twelve years but in recent times is best known for his strident criticism of modern cricket . In 2000 , he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in and selected in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century . In 2009 , Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . = = Early years = = Harvey was the fifth of six boys born to Horace Harvey . Despite his small build , Harvey was born large , weighing in at 4.5 kilograms ( 10 lb ) . The family lived in Broken Hill , where Horace was a miner , before moving to Sydney , and finally to Melbourne in 1926 , where they settled in the inner northern industrial suburb of Fitzroy . There the six boys were taught cricket under the guidance of their father . In conditions conducive to producing batsmen rather than bowlers , they played cricket using a tennis ball on cobblestones or a marble rebounding from the backyard pavement . The boys went to George Street State School and Falconer Street Central School . Cricket and cricket talk was an integral part of the daily family life . Horace held the family batting record with 198 for Broken Hill , and continued to play in Melbourne club cricket . Harvey 's eldest brother Merv went on to play one Test for Australia , while Mick and Ray both played for Victoria . All six brothers , the other two being Brian and Harold also played for Fitzroy in district cricket . Except for Harold , all five represented Victoria in baseball . Harvey played his first game aged nine as a wicket-keeper in the North Fitzroy Central School team , the average age of which was 14 . In a school final , he once made 112 of the total of 140 . Aged twelve , he joined the local Fitzroy club and rose to the first grade team when he was fourteen . By this stage he had transferred to Collingwood Technical School . On the advice of the Victorian coach , Arthur Liddicut , Harvey stopped wicket-keeping to focus on his batting . Joe Plant another Fitzroy veteran also gave advice on batting . Both Liddicut and Plant identified Harvey 's potential as a batsman . \" What they liked about him was his modesty , his eagerness to pick up every point in the game , and his willingness to listen to the old hands . \" Briefly playing for Fitzroy Football Club , Harvey gave up the sport and played baseball during winter . After leaving school , Harvey worked as an apprentice fitter and turner for the Melbourne City Council . The apprenticeship was supposed to take three years , but it eventually took six years because Harvey 's cricket career caused frequent absences . First-class cricket had been cancelled during World War II and resumed in 1945 \u2013 46 . At the start of the season , Harvey was selected for a trial match . The Victorian state team played against the Rest of Victoria , and Harvey represented the latter . However , he made a duck in his only innings and was not selected for the senior state side during the season . An aggressive 113 for Fitzroy against Melbourne Cricket Club in 1946 \u2013 47 saw Harvey selected for the Victorian team at the age of 18 . He made 18 in his only innings during his first-class debut against Tasmania . In the next match against Tasmania , Harvey made his maiden first-class century , scoring 154 . He said that his effort was inspired by elder brother Merv , who gained Test selection in the same year . At the time , Tasmania was not part of Sheffield Shield , and Harvey made his Shield debut against New South Wales . He was dismissed without scoring in the first innings before making 49 in the second innings in an emphatic 298-run win over their arch-rivals . Victoria went on to win the title convincingly . His next match for Victoria was against Wally Hammond 's English tourists . After the fall of three early wickets , Harvey joined captain Lindsay Hassett . He dominated a partnership of 120 , making 69 in his second match against the guileful leg spin of Doug Wright . His opponents had no doubt that he would become a Test player . English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans congratulated him by proclaiming \" We 'll be seeing you in England next year [ for Australia 's 1948 tour of that country ] \" . He ended his debut first-class season with 304 runs at 50.66 . = = Test debut = = In 1947 \u2013 48 , Harvey played in two Shield matches with his brothers Merv and Ray . Merv had already gained Test selection , but soon Neil was attracting more attention . In the opening match of the season , Harvey struck 87 against the touring Indian cricket team . He was selected for an Australian XI , which played the Indians before the Tests in what was effectively a dress rehearsal . He made 32 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 56 in the second as the hosts succumbed for 203 and suffered a 47-run loss . Despite this , he was initially overlooked for the Tests . He reached 35 in each of his next five innings for Victoria , including two fifties . Three months after his 19th birthday , Harvey made his entry into international cricket , in the last two Tests against India . He batted at No. 6 and made 13 in his only innings on debut in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval as Australia swept to an innings victory . The selectors retained him for the Fifth Test on his home ground at Melbourne . After reaching stumps on 78 , he reached his century the following day , 7 February 1948 . His score of 153 after being promoted to No. 5 made him the youngest Australian Test centurion , surpassing Archie Jackson 's previous record . He brought up the mark with an all run five , having turned a short ball from Lala Amarnath towards the square leg boundary . The innings in replacing Bradman was taken to be symbolism of the fact that Harvey had been tipped to become Australia 's leading batsman . His innings laid the foundation of a that secured Australia another innings victory and a 4 \u2013 0 series triumph . It was only his 13th match at first-class level . The innings ensured him a place on the 1948 tour of England . Speaking about Harvey 's selection , Bradman opined \" He has the brilliance and daring of youth , and the likelihood of rapid improvement . \" In the warm-up matches before the team headed to England , Harvey struck 104 against Tasmania and 79 against Western Australia . He had scored 733 runs at 52.36 for the season . Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . Despite scoring a century in Australia 's most recent Test , Harvey was made 12th man and it appeared that he was not initially in Bradman 's Test plans . At first , Harvey struggled in the English conditions , failing to pass 25 in his first six innings . His most notable contribution in the early stages of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford , on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling . The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets . No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat , stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5 / 20 in pursuit of 60 . To make matters worse , Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat , so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912 . Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg , who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it . Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary . Colin McCool was out at 6 / 31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia . Harvey was reprieved on 12 ; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity . Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen , ending unbeaten on 18 not out . It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour . Due to his weak performances in the opening matches , Harvey was omitted for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and were basically a full strength Test team , while Australia fielded their first-choice team and went on to win by an innings . The omission signified that Harvey was on the outer with regards to Test selection . After asking Bradman about his difficulties , Harvey was told that these were caused by rash shot selection and a tendency to hit the ball in the air . Bradman said \" He was technically perfect in his shot production . He was batting well enough and simply getting out early . \" Harvey adapted his style and improved his performance . He scored 36 and 76 not out against Lancashire at Manchester and an unbeaten 100 at Hove against Sussex in only 115 minutes in the last match before the First Test . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton described Harvey 's innings as \" a superb century , rich in youthful daring and stroke production \" . However , this was not enough for selection and reserve opener Bill Brown batted out of position in the middle-order , as he had done against Worcestershire and the MCC . Harvey was the 12th man because of his fielding abilities , and spent a large proportion of time on the field due to an injury to pace spearhead Ray Lindwall . During the first two Tests , Brown struggled in his unfamiliar role , and he was dropped for the third . During the Third Test , opener Sid Barnes was injured , opening a vacancy for the Fourth Test at Headingley . Harvey forced his way into the team with a scoring sequence of 49 , 56 , 43 , 73 * and 95 . After Harvey hit 49 and 56 against Yorkshire , Fingleton opined that he \" probably gained the respect of this most discerning crowd more quickly than any other cricketer in recent years \" . Harvey then scored 43 and 73 against Surrey and had taken a catch amongst a flock of pigeons . Australia wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch the Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener and promised Bradman that he would reach the target quickly . Australia chased down the target of 122 in just 58 minutes and 20.1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon on time . He then added 95 against Gloucestershire , attacking the off spin of Tom Goddard . After England had amassed 496 in the first innings , Australia had slumped to 3 / 68 with Bradman one of the dismissed batsmen . Harvey , the youngest member of the squad , joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller . Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead . Upon arriving in the middle , Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey , \" OK , mate , get up the other end . I 'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised . \" Harvey said , \" Mate , that will do me . \" I couldn 't get up the other end quick enough . I watched him play a few overs and I thought , \" This is good \" , and then they brought Laker on to bowl . The third and the fifth balls of Laker 's over disappeared over my head , on the way up , and they both finished in the crowd for six . . . . I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership . . . and it did so much for my future cricket career . \" The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead and shielding Harvey from Jim Laker , as the young batsman was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him . Miller then hit a series of boundaries against Laker . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joined the counterattack during the next over , hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker , the second of which almost cleared the playing area . By the time Miller was out for 58 , the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , and was likened by Wisden to a \" hurricane \" . Fingleton said that he had never \" known a more enjoyable hour \" of \" delectable cricket \" . Loxton came in at 4 / 189 to join Harvey , who continued to attack the bowling , unperturbed by Miller 's demise . Australia went to lunch on the third day at 4 / 204 , with Harvey on 70 . After lunch , Harvey accelerated after the second new ball was taken , and 80 minutes into the middle session , reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250 . Harvey 's knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours . The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls , bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep . His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment . Harvey ended as the first Australian left-hander to score a century on his Ashes debut , in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match into a balanced position when Australia were finally dismissed for 458 . In the second innings , Harvey took two noted catches , including one where he bent over to catch the ball at ankle height while running . Fingleton said that it \" was the catch of the season \u2014 or , indeed , would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [ against Surrey ] \" . On the final after noon , Harvey was at the crease and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary in the second innings as Australia successfully completed a Test world record run chase of 3 / 404 in less than one day . He had only one more innings in the series , scoring 17 in the Fifth and final Test at The Oval where Australia won by an innings . Harvey added centuries in consecutive matches after the Tests against Somerset and the South of England . In the entire first-class tour , he scored four centuries to aggregate 1129 runs at 53.76 . Harvey was an acrobatic fielder , regarded as the best in the Australian team . Fingleton said that Harvey was \" by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides , who was to save many runs in the field \" . He was twelfth man in the early Tests because of his fielding and he took several acclaimed catches throughout the tour . = = Consolidation = = No international matches were scheduled for the 1948 \u2013 49 Australian season , and Harvey had a disappointing first-class season , scoring only 539 runs at 33.68 . He scored 72 and 75 in Victoria 's totals of 165 and 197 as they lost to arch-rivals New South Wales by 88 runs , but his only other score beyond 50 was an 87 for Lindsay Hassett 's XI in a Test trial at the end of the season . Nevertheless , the selectors persisted with him for the 1949 \u2013 50 tour of South Africa . Harvey was forced to shoulder more responsibility in the batting order now that Bradman had retired and Sid Barnes took an extended break . The youngest player in the team , Harvey rose to the challenge by establishing several Australian records . His Test figures of 660 at 132.00 was the most runs on a Test tour of South Africa by a visiting batsman , surpassing Len Hutton 's previous mark by 83 runs , as were his 1,526 first-class runs at 76.30 and eight centuries on tour . His eight first-class centuries on one South African tour equalled the efforts of Denis Compton , Len Hutton and Arthur Morris . Harvey started the tour well and was highly productive in seven first-class matches leading into the Tests . He scored 100 and 145 not out against North Eastern Transvaal and Orange Free State . There were two matches against a South African XI that were effectively dress rehearsals for the Tests . In the first , Harvey made 34 in an innings victory . He then made an even 100 in the second match , a week before the First Test . He had scored 480 runs at 60.00 in the matches leading up to the Tests . After scoring 34 in the First Test at Johannesburg , Harvey amassed 178 in the first innings of the Second Test at Cape Town , which set up a first innings lead of 248 runs . He then scored 23 not out to guide Australia to an eight-wicket victory in the second innings . This was followed by an unbeaten 151 in five and a half hours at Durban , regarded as one of his finest Test innings . Having been dismissed for 75 on a wet wicket in the first innings , Australia had slumped to 3 / 59 in pursuit of a victory target of 336 . On a crumbling , sticky pitch , the Australians were having extreme difficulty with the spin of Hugh Tayfield and faced their first Test defeat against South Africa for 39 years . Despite a few square cuts , Harvey adapted his game to play a patient innings , prompting heckling from spectators for the first time in his career . On 40 , a ball from Tufty Mann broke through his defence and Harvey thought himself bowled , only to see that the ball had goven for byes . However , Mann and Tayfield began to tire in the heat and Harvey began to score more quickly , reaching 50 in 137 minutes by the lunch break . He registered his slowest ever century on his way to guiding his team to an improbable victory by five wickets . Harvey brought up the winning runs by clipping a ball from Mann to the midwicket boundary . Harvey continued his productive sequence in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg , scoring an unbeaten 56 and 100 in a drawn match . It was the first Test in which Harvey had played that Australia did not win . After scoring 100 not out against Griqualand West , Harvey finished the series with 116 in the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth , as Australia won by an innings and took the series 4 \u2013 0 . He had amassed four centuries in consecutive Tests in the series and had scored six in his first nine Tests , totally 959 runs at 106.55 . Harvey 's fast scoring made him a crowd favourite and marketing drawcard in South Africa . When Harvey was rested for a tour match in East London , media complaints prompted Australian selectors to reverse their decision . He finished the season with 55 in an Australian total of 55 before the tourists dismissed a South African XI for 49 and 90 to complete an innings victory . Harvey 's triple figure average from his first two Test seasons could not be maintained when Australia hosted the 1950 \u2013 51 Ashes series . Following his success in South Africa , Harvey played regularly at either the No. 3 or No. 4 from that point onwards . He managed 362 runs at 40.22 with three half centuries as Australia took the series 4 \u2013 1 . Harvey had trouble with Alec Bedser 's in-swingers in the early part of the series and Bedser was the only Englishman to dismiss Harvey in the first three Tests . On the first day of the series , Harvey top-scored with 74 out of Australia 's 228 . It turned out to be crucial as rain created a sticky wicket ; England made 7 / 68 and Australia 7 / 32 , both declared . Australia went on to win by 70 runs . The Second Test in Melbourne was also low scoring ; Harvey made 42 and 31 as Australia won after neither team passed 200 . He performed steadily through the series , with 39 , 43 and 68 in the next two Tests , which were both won . He then made one and 52 in the Fifth Test defeat ; it was the first in his 14 Tests and Australia 's first since World War II and came on his home ground in Melbourne . Outside the Tests , Harvey scored 141 in a win over South Australia and then added 146 in the second innings of a match against New South Wales to stave off defeat . He ended the season with 1099 runs at 45.79 . The 1951 \u2013 52 season was less productive , with the West Indies touring Australia . Playing in all five Tests , Harvey scored 261 runs at 26.10 with one half century as Australia won 4 \u2013 1 . Harvey had difficulties in dealing with the dual spin bowling combination of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin , who bowled left arm orthodox and leg spin respectively and accounted for him six times in the Tests . His only fifty was an 83 in the first innings of the Fourth Test in Melbourne . Australia went on to complete a dramatic one-wicket victory . Harvey had a poor season overall , scoring only 551 first-class runs at 32.41 without managing a single century . = = Peak years = = Harvey started the 1952 \u2013 53 season without a first-class century in more than 18 months and in three matches ahead of the Tests , suffered two defeats and was still yet to break his drought . Having failed to score a century in ten Tests and almost three years , the season saw Harvey at his productive best as South Africa , whom he had scored four centuries against three years earlier , toured Australia . On a slow pitch difficult for stroke play , and Harvey scored 109 and 52 in Brisbane where Australia grounded out a victory in the First Test . He top-scored in the first innings and was the second top-score ( run out ) in the second . Such was his performance in the series that his scores of 11 and 60 in the Second Test , top-scoring in the second innings , were his worst , as Australia lost their first Test to South Africa for 42 years . He then top-scored with 190 in the Third Test in Sydney to set up a large first innings lead of 270 and an innings victory . Harvey alone made more than his opponents in the first innings and the innings saw him complete 1000 Test runs against the South Africans in only eight Tests . Harvey made it consecutive centuries in as many matches , with 84 and 116 in Adelaide . Starting with an on-driven boundary off the first ball of the last day 's play , Harvey 's century took 106 minutes and was the fastest record in the Australia since World War II and the sixth fastest of all time in Australia . With leading pacemen Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller breaking down in the match , Harvey bowled for only the third time in his Test career . He took his first of three wickets at Test level , that of Russell Endean as a depleted Australian attack could not defeat the visitors who finished seven wickets down . As the series 2 \u2013 1 in Australia 's favour and not yet won , the Fifth Test in Melbourne was a timeless Test . Harvey compiled his third consecutive century and highest Test score of 205 as Australia amassed 520 in the first innings . This put Australia in control of the Test , despite South Africa successfully chasing an unlikely target of 295 . Harvey accumulated 834 Test runs at 92.66 in the series . This surpassed Bradman 's aggregate of 806 runs in 1931 \u2013 32 as a series record against South Africa . In ten Tests against South Africa , he had eight centuries , totalling 1494 runs at an average of 106.71 . Harvey totalled 1,659 runs at 63.81 for the season , the second highest tally for a season in Australian history , just 31 runs behind Bradman 's record . In the last four matches of the season , he scored 95 , 148 , 49 , 81 and 48 to come within striking distance . In the last match of the season , Western Australian captain Wally Langdon declared early on the last afternoon to allow Harvey another innings so he could break the record . However , Harvey muttered \" I wouldn 't want to break a record that way \" and managed only 13 . In 1953 he became only the third Australian in a quarter of a century to score 2,000 runs on an Ashes tour . Bradman ( three times ) and Stan McCabe were the others . He made 2,040 at 65.80 and his ten centuries were twice that of the next best in the side . Harvey started the first-class campaign with an unbeaten 202 against Leicestershire , setting up an innings victory . After reaching 25 in each of the next four innings without converting any starts into a score beyond 66 , Harvey rectified this in the two weeks before the Tests started . He struck 109 against the Minor Counties , 103 against Lancashire , 82 and 137 not out against Sussex and 109 against Hampshire . His 109 against Minor Counties was only nine less than the entire opposition managed in two innings , and he had scored 540 runs in four completed innings in 14 days . Harvey was not at his best in the five Tests . In the 11 innings leading up to the Tests , Harvey 's lowest score was 14 , and he had only failed to pass 30 twice . However , in the First Test at Trent Bridge , Harvey had a duck and two and falling twice to Bedser as Australia hung on for a draw in a rain-affected contest . After scoring 69 against Yorkshire , Harvey made 59 and 21 in the Second Test at Lord 's , again falling to Bedser in both innings . Some tenacious batting in the second innings saw the hosts save the match with three wickets in hand . Harvey returned to form by striking 141 against Gloucestershire before taking 3 / 9 , his first three-wicket haul at first-class level , to help Australia take a nine-wicket win . He added a second century in as many innings with 118 in an innings win over Northamptonshire . Harvey then struck 122 in the rain affected Third Test at Manchester ; he helped Australia take a 42-run first innings lead , but was out for a duck in the second innings . Australia collapsed to 8 / 35 and were saved from defeat by the rain , which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible . Harvey then returned to Headingley , the venue of his famous innings five years earlier . In a low-scoring match , he top-scored for the entire match with 71 in the first innings as Australia took a 99-run lead . The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes at the start of the final day , but time-wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours . This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match . Harvey quickly scored 34 at a run a minute , and Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win . At that point , English medium-pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket-keeper more than two metres down the leg side to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball , but the umpires did not penalise them as wides . The match ended in a draw , and Harvey described Bailey 's tactics as \" absolutely disgusting \" . English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans said that the tourists \" were absolutely livid \" and he sympathised with them , saying that \" they were right \" in claiming that Bailey 's bowling was \" the worst kind of negative cricket \" and that he had \" cheated [ them ] of victory \" . With the series locked at 0 \u2013 0 , the fate of The Ashes would be determined in the Fifth and final Test at The Oval . In the lead-up , Harvey scored 113 and 180 in consecutive innings against Surrey and Glamorgan , before failing to pass single figures in his next three innings before the deciding match . Harvey made 36 as Australia made 275 batting first . England then took a 31-run lead and Harvey was out for only one in the second innings as the hosts won the Ashes 1 \u2013 0 after 19 years in Australian hands . Harvey scored 346 runs at 34.60 for the series ; in a low-scoring series , this placed him second behind captain Lindsay Hassett ( 365 runs at 36.50 ) . Harvey failed to pass 41 in the four first-class matches remaining after the Tests . With the retirement Hassett at the end of the season , Harvey was to bear more responsibility in the batting line-up . In recognition of his performances during the summer , during which he scored 2040 runs at 65.40 , he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year . The next highest Australian aggregate and average was 1433 at 51.17 by Miller , and the second most prolific centurymaker was Hassett with five . Harvey returned to Australia and played in the 1953 \u2013 54 season , which was purely domestic . He scored 639 runs at 42.60 , including a century against New South Wales and four fifties . He had a few near-misses during the season ; he scored 97 against Queensland in two matches and made 88 against South Australia . The 1954 \u2013 55 season saw England tour Australia , and Harvey scored 98 in three innings in warm-up matches against the visitors . He struck 162 in the First Test in Brisbane after Australia were sent in , helping to compile 8 / 601 to set up an innings victory . Between Tests , he scored 59 and 34 not out for Victoria against the Englishmen . This was followed by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4 / 77 needing 223 to win on a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham . The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50 m behind the bat . Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners , and he farmed the strike ruthlessly , protecting the tailenders and counter-attacking the England fast bowlers , relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side . Schoolboys watching the game leaned over the fence to beckon the boundaries towards them . Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9 / 145 with 78 runs still required , but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory . Harvey continued to attack the bowling , and he hooked Tyson over fine leg 's head for four . Together , Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required . At this point , the Australian pair were confident . Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy , and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future . However , it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket-keeper . Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life , a defiant , unbeaten 92 , exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15 . From there on , Harvey 's series was unproductive , failing to pass 31 in the six innings of the final three Tests . Australia 's form slumped along with that of Harvey , losing the next two Tests and the series 3 \u2013 1 . Harvey ended with 354 runs at 44.25 for the series . Despite this , he continued to productive in the other first-class matches and was by far the most productive batsman in the 1954 \u2013 55 Australian season , accumulating 1100 at 47.83 runs ahead of Les Favell 's 663 . He scored a pair of 62s in a 36-run win over New South Wales , 95 and 66 against Queensland and 82 and 47 in a match for a Tasmania Combined XI against England . This was followed by a tour in early 1955 to the West Indies , the first by an Australian team . Harvey began with two consecutive centuries , scoring exactly 133 in both the First and Second Tests at Kingston and Port-of-Spain respectively . The matches ended in an innings victory and draw to Australia respectively . In a low scoring match in Georgetown , Harvey scored 38 and 41 * as Australia took a 2 \u2013 0 lead . Another half century in the drawn Fourth Test followed , before Harvey scored the second double century of his career , 204 in the Fifth Test in Kingston in just over seven hours of batting . His 295 run partnership with Colin McDonald was the foundation of a Test total of 8 / 758 , setting up an innings victory for Australia . He totalled 650 runs at 108.33 for the series . For the entire tour , he scored 789 runs at 71.73 . After the tour Arthur Morris retired , leaving Harvey as the most experienced batsman of the team . Harvey had also expunged his demons that he experienced against Ramadhin and Valentine in the previous series . Of the spin duo , only Ramadhin was able to dismiss Harvey on one occasion . The 1955 \u2013 56 Australian summer was another purely domestic season . Harvey had a successful campaign with 772 runs 55.14 . He struck 128 and 76 against a New South Wales team composed mainly of Test players , but Victoria 's arch-rivals hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand . He added two further centuries and a 96 , and all of these innings came in the span of a month in which he amassed 612 runs . = = Struggles in 1956 = = The 1956 Ashes tour to England was a disappointment for Harvey individually as well for the Australians collectively . It was an English summer dominated by off spinner Jim Laker and his Surrey teammate Tony Lock , who repeatedly dismantled the tourists on dusty spinning pitches specifically tailored to their cater for them . The tour started poorly for Harvey . In five innings in the first three weeks , he scored only 36 runs at 7.20 , and this included a ten-wicket defeat at the hands of Laker and Lock 's Surrey . It was Australia 's first loss to a county side since 1912 . Harvey began to run into some form after that , scoring 45 against Cambridge University before the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , which fielded a virtual England Test team in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests . Harvey made 225 in Australia 's 413 and the hosts made 9 / 203 to draw the match . However , he was unable to replicate this form in the Tests . In the First Test at Nottingham Harvey scored 64 and three in a rain-affected draw . He then made a duck and ten as Australia took the series lead in the Second Test at Lord 's . Despite Australia 's success , Harvey was having an extended run-drought ; he had made only 23 runs in three weeks . Then came the two Australian capitulations against Laker and Lock in the Tests . Harvey made 11 as Australia were bowled out for 143 and forced to follow on in the Third Test played on a turning pitch at Headingley . He then contributed 69 of 140 in the second innings of the Third Test at Headingley , when the rest of the team struggled to deal with Laker and Lock , who spun England to an innings victory . It was the first time Australia had suffered an innings defeat in a Test since 1938 . However , Harvey was unable to repeat his defiant form over the next three weeks . The Fourth Test in Manchester was the low point , when Harvey managed a pair , falling both times to Laker , who took a world record 19 wickets . Australia were routed by an innings in what is known as \" Laker 's match \" to concede the Ashes 2 \u2013 1 . The debacle at Old Trafford was part of a three-week trough during which Harvey scored only 11 runs , including three consecutive ducks in a 17-day period that yielded not a solitary run . Harvey then returned to productivity with 145 against Warwickshire and added a further half-century in the remaining matches . He also took 5 / 57 in an innings to help set up a seven-wicket win over the Minor Counties , although the match was not first-class . Harvey compiled 197 runs at 19.70 in five Tests with two half centuries . It was by far his most unproductive summer in England , with 976 runs at 31.48 . Such was the dominance of the Laker-Lock-led attack that Harvey was Australia 's fifth-highest runscorer in the Tests and fourth in the first-class matches . On the return to Australia , the team stopped on the Indian subcontinent to play their first Tests on Pakistani and Indian soil respectively . In a short tour , the four Tests were the only fixtures . Harvey failed to pass double figures in a one off Test against Pakistan in Karachi , the first between the two countries . Moving to India , he scored 140 in the drawn Second Test in Bombay , scoring runs all around the ground . Due to injuries and illness to many of the bowlers , the Australians were unable to dismiss their hosts twice . In the final match , Australia were in trouble after taking a 41-run first innings lead . In the second innings they were struggling on a sticky wicket caused by flooding , but made 69 out of 9 / 189 in the low-scoring Third Test in Calcutta to help Australia to a 2 \u2013 0 series win . He ended with 253 runs at 63.25 for the series . His performances on the subcontinent were marked by his aggressive footwork in moving down to meet the pitch of the ball . After seven months away , the Australians returned home . = = Senior player and vice captaincy = = As expected , the Australian team 's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller , retired from cricket after the tour . Harvey replaced Johnson as Victorian captain and was the logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy , as the most experienced member of the team ( 48 Tests ) . Queensland 's captain , the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall , was no longer an automatic Test selection . However , both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour . Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the captaincy , which went to Ian Craig , who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper . Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests ; he had yet to establish himself in the team . After several disappointing results against England , the selectors chose a youthful team . Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956 \u2013 57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957 \u2013 58 Test tour to South Africa . Australia 's two new leaders featured in a dramatic game during the season \u2014 the first tied match in Sheffield Shield history , played at the Junction Oval in Melbourne . New South Wales , chasing 161 to win , slumped to 7 / 70 when Craig ( suffering tonsillitis ) defied medical orders , left his hospital bed , and came out to bat . A partnership of 75 with Richie Benaud took them to within 16 runs of victory , but another collapse left the scores tied . The day after the captaincy announcement , the Harvey-led Victorians met Craig 's New South Welshmen at the SCG in the last match of the Shield season . Harvey admitted to being irked by the board 's snub and felt that it was because of his blunt nature . The men were cordial at the toss and Craig sent the Victorians in to bat . At the same time , Victorian batsman Colin McDonald hit a ball into his face and broke his nose while practising , as Harvey and Craig went out to toss . Harvey asked for a gentleman 's agreement to allow a substitute for McDonald . Craig refused , citing the importance of the match . This evoked a rare angry response from Harvey , according to Benaud . Playing with ten men , Benaud said that Harvey \" proceeded , with a certain amount of anger , to play one of the best innings I have seen in Sheffield Shield \" . He made 209 and later forced New South Wales to follow-on . In the end the match was drawn and Harvey was unable to deny New South Wales the title . Harvey said that his first double century for Victoria \" gave me as much pleasure as any innings I had ever played \" . He finished his only season as Victorian captain by leading the Shield averages with 836 runs at 104.50 . His other substantial scores were 108 ( more than half the team total ) and 53 in an innings loss to Queensland , 125 and 66 not out in a win over against South Australia and 115 in the return match against Queensland . In a selection trial , he led Harvey 's XI to a seven-wicket win over Lindwall 's XI , scoring 31 and 61 not out . The New Zealand tour was regarded as a test of Craig as a leader . Wicket-keeper Barry Jarman said that Craig \" had to do it himself ... Iwasn 't so dumb that I couldn 't see the senior players didn 't give him much support \" . The senior players resented his surprise selection as captain , but he gained favour by defying a management-imposed curfew , which was later scrapped . Harvey was unable to maintain his from the Australian season after crossing the Tasman to face the New Zealanders . He scored 129 runs at 25.80 , including an 84 , as Australia won the third and final match to take the series 1 \u2013 0 . Outside the international matches , Harvey was productive , and he totalled 460 runs at 46.00 for the tour . Some players remained resentful of Craig 's dubious elevation ahead of Harvey during the 1957 \u2013 58 tour of South Africa but appreciated that he had not promoted himself and that he was fair and open to input from teammates . On the tour , Harvey broke a finger at catching practice and missed the early tour matches . After it healed , Harvey returned for a match against a South African XI , in a virtual dress rehearsal for the Tests . He scored 173 as the tourists crushed their hosts by an innings . However , he broke the same finger again and missed the First Test , ending a run of 48 consecutive Test matches . He returned for the remaining Tests and scored 68 in the Third Test to help to force a draw , after Australia had conceded a 221-run first innings lead , but apart from that he had a disappointing series , failing to pass 25 and finishing with 131 runs at 21.83 . Despite the disagreement as to whether Craig was deserving of the captaincy , the team proceeded smoothly without infighting . Prior to the Fifth Test , Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form , which would have made Harvey captain . Peter Burge , the third member of the selection panel and a Harvey supporter , was comfortable with this , but Harvey relinquished his opportunity to seize the leadership by ordering Burge to retain Craig . When the vote was formally taken , Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig , who was still offering to drop himself . The Tests aside , Harvey continued to score regularly in the other games , and ended with 759 first-class runs at 50.60 , with two centuries and five fifties . The team under Craig and Harvey , labelled the worst to leave Australian shores , went home 3 \u2013 0 victors in the five Test series . = = Move to New South Wales and non-captaincy = = After returning from South Africa , Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview . He revealed that the players earned only \u00a3 85 per Test and that he was almost broke , despite being an automatic selection for Australia . Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life , so he was contemplating a move to South Africa , the homeland of his wife , Iris . Consequently , Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney , so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy . As a new player to NSW , he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state 's pecking order , despite being the Test vice-captain , ahead of Benaud . Fatefully , Craig was unfit for the start of the 1958 \u2013 59 season , due to the after-effects of hepatitis . This left the Australian captaincy open again . Harvey started the season strongly and scored 326 runs in his first three innings . This included 160 against Queensland and 149 for his new state against the touring England team of Peter May . In this match , Benaud had captained New South Wales and the hosts had the better of the play . They took a 214-run first innings lead and May 's men when 6 / 356 when time ran out . Harvey was appointed to captain an Australian XI in a warm-up match against the touring Englishmen , indicating that the selectors were considering him for the Test captaincy . Harvey scored a duck and 38 and the Australians lost heavily by 345 runs on a wicket with a crater . Therefore , Benaud was made Australian captain ahead of Harvey . As Benaud 's deputy , Harvey helped materially in Australia 's surprise 4 \u2013 0 series victory to reclaim the Ashes . Harvey 's form was modest , though . He scored 296 runs at 42.29 , with more than half coming in one innings \u2014 a brilliant 167 in the Second Test at Melbourne , more than half his team 's 308 , which helped secure an eight wicket victory in the match . Otherwise , a 41 in the Fourth Test was the only other time he passed 25 in the series . Outside the Tests , he scored 92 in the second match of the season between New South Wales and England , and ended the season with 949 runs at 49.95 . It was season of two-halves ; in the latter two months , he scored only 339 runs . During the 1959 \u2013 60 season , Australian undertook an arduous tour of the subcontinent , with three and five Tests against Pakistan and India , respectively . Prior to the trip , Harvey made 112 in the second innings to help Lindwall 's XI defeat Benaud 's XI by seven wickets . In Dhaka , East Pakistan ( now in Bangladesh ) , Harvey made 96 on a matting pitch over rough ground in the First Test , mastering the medium pace of Fazal Mahmood , while his teammates struggled to score . In the course of the innings , Harvey had to overcome a fever , dysentery and physical illness , which forced him to leave six times to recompose himself . Gideon Haigh called it \" one of his most dazzling innings \" . Described by Benaud as \" one of the best innings at Test level \" , it set up an Australian win . During his stay at the crease , his partners contributed 48 runs while seven wickets fell . Harvey 's innings allowed Australia to score 225 in reply to the hosts ' 200 . Harvey then made 30 in the second innings to help ensure an eight-wicket win . After scoring 43 in the first innings , the second Test in Lahore came down to a run-chase for Australia , with Harvey and Norm O 'Neill seemingly on schedule to win before time ran out . However , the Pakistani fielders began to waste time in an attempt to foil an Australian victory . They swapped the cover and midwicket fielders very slowly whenever the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O 'Neill took a single and changed the batsman on strike . To counter this , Harvey deliberately backed away from a straight ball and let himself be bowled , throwing his wicket away for 37 . This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O 'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give the Pakistanis no opportunity to waste time by switching the field . Australia won the match with minutes to spare . Harvey scored 54 and 13 not out in the drawn third Test at Karachi . Australia took the series 2 \u2013 0 , but would not win another Test in Pakistan until 1998 . Harvey ended the series with 273 runs at 54.60 . In India , Harvey scored 114 out of Australia 's 468 in the First Test at Delhi , setting up an innings victory for Australia . On a pitch conducive to spin at Kanpur for the second Test , Harvey was given a rare opportunity to bowl and he took the wicket of the Indian captain , Gulabrai Ramchand . In addition , he scored 51 and 25 , the second highest Australian score in each innings in a low-scoring match , but India won to square the series , with off spinner Jasu Patel taking 14 / 124 . Harvey hit 102 in a drawn third Test in Bombay and took his third ( and final ) Test wicket , A. G. Milkha Singh , in the fourth Test at Madras . He ended the series with 356 runs at 50.86 , a significant contribution to Australia 's 2 \u2013 1 triumph . = = International twilight = = In the last years of his Test career , Harvey struggled , making 876 runs at 33.69 in three Test series . At the start of the 1960 \u2013 61 season , there was little indication of this . In his first five innings for the summer , Harvey hit 135 against Queensland , 80 and 63 for an Australian XI against the touring West Indies , 229 against Queensland and 109 for New South Wales against the Caribbean team . However , his form tapered away during the thrilling 1960 \u2013 61 home series against the West Indies ( which included the first tie in Test history ) . Harvey was ineffective apart from a score of 85 in the second innings of the Third Test , which Australia lost . He then missed the Fourth Test due to injury . He struggled in the Tests , scoring only 143 runs at 17.88 , but prospered against the Caribbean tourists in the tour matches , scoring 326 runs at 81.50 . Overall , he totalled 849 runs at 56.60 for the season . Harvey began his final tour to England in 1961 , and Benaud 's regular absences due to a shoulder injury allowed him to lead Australia for a third of the tour matches . This included most of the first month of the tour ; Benaud hurt his shoulder in the first match against Worcestershire , and spent most of the next three weeks either not bowling or travelling to London away from his men for specialist treatment . At one stage , Australia were left with only 10 men on the field when Benaud excused himself and his replacement succumbed to illness , requiring an Englishman to stand in . Harvey scored 474 runs at 47.40 in eight matches leading up to the Tests , including centuries against Lancashire and Glamorgan . It seemed that Harvey would captain Australia in a Test for the first time with Benaud 's shoulder still problematic , but the captain declared himself fit . Harvey then made 114 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston . This helped Australia take a 321-run first innings lead and put them in control of the match , but the hosts batted for the remainder of the match to stave off defeat ; Benaud 's shoulder prevented him from bowling more than nine overs . The injury forced Benaud out of the next Test , meaning that Harvey finally captained Australia at the highest level , in the Second Test at Lord 's , with Davidson carrying an injury and wicketkeeper Wally Grout with a black eye . This meant that Australia 's two best bowlers were injured , although Davidson agreed to play . Played on a controversial pitch with a noticeable ridge running across it , which caused irregular bounce , it was one of the great Test matches , known as \" The Battle of the Ridge \" . Davidson took 5 / 42 and bruised many of the English batsmen with the irregular bounce as the hosts were bowled out for 205 . Australia then replied with 339 , in large part due to Bill Lawry 's 130 , during which he sustained many blows . In the second innings , Harvey 's captaincy moves proved to be highly productive . He gave the new ball to Graham McKenzie , a young paceman playing in his first international series . McKenzie responded by taking 5 / 37 . Harvey brought the part-time leg spin of Bob Simpson into the attack when Ray Illingworth had just arrived at the crease , and moved himself into the leg slip position . Illingworth edged Simpson into Harvey 's hands for a duck . England fell for 202 , leaving Australia a target of 69 . However , victory appeared to be far from certain when Australia slumped to 4 / 19 on the erratic surface . Harvey sent Peter Burge out to attack the bowling , a tactic that worked as Australia won by five wickets . Burge hit the winning runs after earlier being dropped . The \" Battle of the Ridge \" was the only time Harvey captained Australia in a Test match . Despite the win , Harvey was not prominent in terms of his individual contribution , scoring 27 and four . Harvey described the win as \" propbably my proudest moment . We really got on the French champagne that afternoon . I knew it 'd be my only Test match as captain and , being at Lord 's , I decided to make the best of it . \" Benaud returned for the Third Test , when England levelled the series despite twin half-centuries of 73 and 53 from Harvey , who top-scored in both innings on a dustbowl in a match that lasted only three days . Harvey failed to pass 35 in the last two Tests , and ended with 338 runs at 42.25 , and was a significant factor in Australia 's eventual 2 \u2013 1 victory . In the second half of the tour , Harvey added centuries against Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire and took his career best bowling fugres of 4 / 8 against Middlesex to help set up a ten-wicket win . He ended his final tour for Australia with 1452 runs at 44.00 with five centuries . During the season , Harvey and Benaud led aggressively to force a result through attacking strategy and a determination to avoid time-wasting . The 1961 \u2013 62 was purely domestic , and Harvey played a full season in the Sheffield Shield as New South Wales won their ninth consecutive title . However , Harvey was not prominent in the team 's success and scored only 425 runs at 26.56 with two fifties for the season . Having stated his intention to retire at the end of the summer , Harvey started his final season in 1962 \u2013 63 strongly . He scored 83 , 44 and 128 not in his first three interstate innings for the season , and then scored 51 , 21 and 63 in warm-up matches against England . Harvey was thus selected in the series against England , his last in international cricket . During the season , Harvey applied to the Australian Cricket Board for permission to work as a journalist while also playing cricket . The application was refused , but Harvey wrote some bitter criticism of England captain Ted Dexter at the end of the series . Following a complaint from the Marylebone Cricket Club , the ACB said that it deplored Harvey 's comments . Beginning steadily with half-centuries in the first and third Tests , Harvey made his 21st and final century in the fourth Test at Adelaide . Scoring 154 in a drawn match at the venue where his international career began 15 seasons earlier , Harvey then returned to his adopted hometown of Sydney for his farewell match . With the series level at 1 \u2013 1 , the Ashes were still alive but the game turned into a dull draw and Harvey scored 22 and 28 . He was bowled by David Allen in the final innings . In the two English innings , he held six catches to equal the world record , a reminder of his prowess as one of Australia 's great all-round fielders . Harvey retired as Australia 's most capped player , and a tally of runs and centuries second only to Don Bradman . Harvey made centuries in two of his last three first-class matches . In his last Sheffield Shield match , he scored an unbeaten 231 against South Australia in less than five hours , including 120 runs in one session . This set up a ten-wicket victory . In his final season , Harvey scored 1110 runs at 52.85 . = = Style = = Harvey was regarded as a mercurial batsman of great artistry and style . A short man at 172 cm ( 5 ft ; 8 in ) , he batted with aggression , and was known for his timing of the ball . His batting against spin bowling in particular was a crowd pleaser , highlighted by his extravagant footwork in charging the bowlers . Harvey often charged five paces down the pitch to spinners , with one bowler quipping \" He kept coming so far along the track toward me that I thought he must want to shake my hands \" . Despite running out of the crease so much , Harvey was never stumped in a Test match . He was of the time belief that any bowling could and should be hit , and gave the impression that the balls were reaching the boundary with a minimum of power . According to Johnnie Moyes , \" the sight of his slim figure , neat and trim-looking , always capless , coming to bat brought new hope for spectators . He will never prod a half volley or decline the challenge of a long hop ... he will go looking for the ball which he can hit for four . \" Following the retirement of Sir Donald Bradman , he was seen as Australia 's leading batsman , noted by critics for a similar ability to change the mood of matches with his attacking play . Ashley Mallett said that Harvey is Australia 's best batsman since Bradman . This was despite the fact that he was found to have faulty eyesight . With the global expansion of cricket , Harvey was the first Australian to make Test centuries in 15 different cities , succeeding in a variety of conditions . Harvey made 67 first-class centuries spread across 35 venues in six countries . He scored 38 of these overseas , where his average was higher . He was the first batsman to score more than 10,000 runs for Australian teams at home and abroad . Harvey 's attacking style often led to criticism that his batting was risky , with England captain Len Hutton feeling that he played and missed too much , while dour all-rounder Trevor Bailey quipped \" I wonder how many runs Harvey would make if he decided to stop playing strokes with an element of risk about them \" . Harvey was nevertheless happy to continue his flamboyant strokeplay . However , as Harvey progressed in seniority , he eschewed his hook shot and played more conservatively for his team 's sake . He typically evaded bouncers by tilting his head , rather than ducking the ball . Although Harvey started as a wicketkeeper at school , he became a highly regarded cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher . He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions , taking only three wickets in his Test career . Away from the field , Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner , in complete contrast to his dynamic batting , and his non-smoking , non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period . Harvey was known for his respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips . When not travelling overseas on cricket tours , Harvey played baseball in the winter for the Fitzroy Baseball Club . He was twice named in the Australian baseball team but the team was named only for the distinction accorded on the players . That is , they never competed . Harvey 's fielding abilities were regarded by Wisden as the \" finest outfielder in the world \" during his career . As a baseball infielder Harvey developed a half round arm throw ; its speed and accuracy caused many batsmen to be run out while attempting a run . Ray Robinson said that Harvey 's throw was \" arrow-like \" in accuracy and that \" as a versatile fieldsman , this ball-hawk ... takes top place \" . His baseball training also influenced his habit of catching the ball above head height , with which he rarely dropped catches . This was based on the theory that the fielder need never take his eyes off the ball and , if it were to bounce out of his hands , he would have time to attempt to grab the rebound . Harvey also covered ground quickly and possessed and efficient method of picking up and returning the ball . From late 1958 when Norm O 'Neill made his Test debut until Harvey 's retirement in 1963 , the duo formed a formidable pairing in the covers , helping to restrict opposition batsmen from scoring in the region . = = Later years = = He was an Australian selector from 1967 to 1979 . Immediately after his appointment , he was embroiled in controversy during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967 \u2013 68 . The Queensland Cricket Association wrote to the board , complaining that Harvey , who was the selector on duty at the Test , had missed two hours of play . He had been at a race meeting at the invitation of the QCA president . The ACB gave Harvey a talking to . Despite this , he retained his position at the next annual election , with Queensland 's Ken Mackay failing to gain a seat on the selection panel . From 1971 onwards , Harvey was the chairman of selectors . It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket , where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked in the middle of the 1970 \u2013 71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials . Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was still one of Australia 's most productive batsmen . The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which , led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players . This resulted in the recall of Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team . Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players , Harvey left the selection panel . The WSC representatives felt that Harvey 's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players . After returning from South Africa in 1950 , Harvey was offered a job in captain Lindsay Hassett 's sports store . Harvey accepted immediately because sports stores gave more flexible arrangements for leave to play cricket . Harvey was sponsored by Stuart Surridge to use their cricket equipment . He was paid \u00a3 300 a year , but nevertheless lived at home and shared a bedroom with his brothers Brian and Ray until he married , due to poverty . He used the same cricket uniforms for more than five years . Harvey 's career extended into a successful business , Har-V-Sales , which distributed tupperware , kitchen and cosmetic products . In later life , he was known for his blunt and critical comments towards modern players , believing the cricket in earlier times to be superior . After Steve Waugh 's team set a world record of consecutive Test victories , Harvey named three Australian teams that he thought to be superiors , saying \" no , far from it \" in response to the suggestion that Waugh 's men were the best team in history . He attributed the wins to weak opponents , stating \" No I don 't think they 're up to the world standard they were years ago \" and that the 1980s West Indies team were far superior . He also criticised the Australian team for publicly praising the skills of their opponents , believing that they did so to aggrandise their statistical performances against teams he considered to be weak . In 2000 he was named in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century and criticised modern day batsmen , noting that players in earlier eras had to play on sticky wickets saying \" these guys who play out here are a little bit spoilt in my opinion . They play on flat wickets all the time and they grizzle if ... the ball does a little bit off the pitch , and whatever ... But we had to put up with that \" and going to assert his opinion that the current players would be no match . Harvey was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 , in the first annual induction of two players since the inaugural ten members were announced in 1996 . In 2009 , Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985 . Harvey vociferously called for Shane Warne and Mark Waugh to be banned from cricket after it was revealed that they accepted money from bookmakers to give pitch and weather information and the ACB privately fined them . He lamented the decline in player conduct in the modern era , also criticising the modern advent of sledging . In 2002 , Harvey called for Mark and Steve Waugh to be dropped from the Australian team , claiming that they were a waste of space . He stated : Money is the only thing that keeps them playing ... If they earned the same money as I did when I was playing they 'd have retired at 34 as I did , and Australian cricket would be the better for it . When Waugh was close to being dropped during the 2002 \u2013 03 series against England , Harvey wrote off a half-century made by Waugh , saying \" he 's playing against probably one of the worst cricket teams I 've ever seen . \" = = Personal life = = During the 1949 \u2013 50 tour of South Africa , Harvey met his first wife Iris Greenish . At the time , Greenish was only 16 years old and Harvey 21 , and their relationship became the subject of controversy when her father told the media that he would object to the couple 's engagement until his daughter turned 18 . They married four years later at Holy Trinity Church in East Melbourne and had three children , two sons and a daughter . After a twenty-year marriage , Harvey and Iris divorced . Two years later , he married Barbara McGifford at the age of 47 , and subsequently had three more children . = = Test match performance = = = = = Test Centuries = = = The following table summarises the Test centuries scored by Neil Harvey .

                    "text": "ILoo = The iLoo ( short for Internet loo ) was a cancelled Microsoft project to develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet . The iLoo , which was to debut at British summer festivals , was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet , an adjustable plasma screen , a membrane wireless keyboard , a six-channel speaker system , and toilet paper embossed with popular web site addresses . The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside , and was to be guarded . It was intended as the next in a series of successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations , including MSN Street , MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair . The project was announced by MSN UK on April 30 , 2003 , and was widely ridiculed before being declared a hoax by Microsoft on May 12 . On May 13 , another Microsoft press release stated that although the project had not been a hoax , it had been cancelled because it would do little to promote the MSN brand . There has since been speculation as to whether the project was cancelled for fear of being sued by Andrew Cubitt , who had invented the similarly named product \" i-Loo \" . The iLoo was described as a public relations \" debacle \" by Online Journalism Review . = = Description = = The iLoo was designed to be a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet that would allow users to surf the internet while using the loo . Internally , the facility would have a broadband connection via wireless 802.11b , a wireless waterproof keyboard , a swivel plasma screen running Windows XP Professional , a 6-channel surround-sound system beneath the sink , toilet paper embossed with popular URLs , and a suction toilet . Externally , the facility would feature an MSN logo and have a \" Hotmail station \" with an additional plasma screen and keyboard for waiting consumers . A security guard was to be stationed near the unit to ensure that it was being properly used and to prevent the unit from being stolen . The iLoo was to debut \" at a majority of the summer season festivals \" . The iLoo was to be deployed only in Britain . = = Public relations timeline = = The project was announced on April 30 , 2003 in press release by MSN UK , MSN 's British subsidiary , as part of a \" series of MSN.co.uk initiatives which look at the changing nature of how we use the web as it constantly evolves \" . The press release stated that : The UK \u2019 s most popular website msn.co.uk is creating the world \u2019 s first \u2018 Internet Loo \u2019 . The iLoo will be mobile and is part of MSN \u2019 s mission to allow instant logging on \u2018 anytime and any place \u2019 . In time for the summer festival season , MSN is in the process of converting a portable loo to create a unique experience for surfers looking for an alternative to the bog-standard festival loo experience . Users will be able to sit down , undock a wireless keyboard and conveniently access the first ever WWW.C. The press release also stated that \" MSN is also in talks with toilet paper manufacturers to produce special web paper for those in need of URL inspiration \" . News of the iLoo was widely circulated amongst mainstream media . The story became the most-emailed story on Yahoo ! News on May 1 , 2003 , being emailed over 4000 times . The iLoo was widely derided and press coverage subjected MSN and Microsoft to heavy criticism . On May 10 , The Inquirer published a story in which Andrew Cubitt alleged that \" Microsoft stole his iLoo idea \" from his i-Loo invention . On May 12 , Microsoft announced that the iLoo was a \" hoax perpetrated by its British division \" calling it an \" April Fool 's joke \" and issued an apology for the confusion . The Associated Press , however , stated that they had previously received confirmation of the project from two of Microsoft 's PR firms : Waggener Edstrom Worldwide and Red Consultancy . The Seattle Post-Intelligencer also stated that it received confirmation from Waggener Edstrom and was even provided with a schematic drawing . Furthermore , April Fools was almost a month before , and Microsoft had never before released a fake press release . On May 13 , 2003 , Microsoft retracted the denial , stating that the iLoo had been a legitimate demonstration project that was to be released in Britain for summer music festivals , but had been terminated by Microsoft executives in Redmond , Washington who believed the iLoo was inappropriate with the final decision made by MSN senior vice president David Cole . MSN product manager Lisa Gurry stated that the project \" didn 't really map to our global branding objectives \" . Microsoft again apologized for the miscommunication stating \" the confusion over the legitimacy of this effort was caused by people moving too quickly and who misspoke before gathering all of the relevant information \" . Prior to the cancellation , an iLoo prototype was in the \" early stages of construction \" . MSN allows regional units to design their own marketing campaigns , and the UK division had developed a reputation for innovative campaigns , in this case involving British toilet humour . The iLoo which was designed for the UK as part of a \" tongue-in-cheek marketing initiative \" was \" intended to be the next in line of a number of clever initiatives in the UK involving introducing the internet in interesting locations , including MSN Street , MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair \" . The previous initiatives were well received . Microsoft stated that no employees were disciplined as a result of the debacle , although the company stated that it would conduct \" internal discussions \" . = = Reaction = = Although the product was not publicly released , many questioned whether \" Microsoft had lost its senses \" and the product was widely derided . Critics contended that the product was a waste of money and doomed to fail . Concerns were raised about how the iLoo would serve to extend waiting lines , how hygienic it would be to share keyboards in a public loo , and what would happen if the keyboard were to be urinated upon . Critics also questioned whether users would spend enough time in the loo to make use of the internet facilities , noting that \" most port-a-potty users stay only long enough to relieve themselves without having to inhale . \" The iLoo , given its toiletry-related nature , subjected MSN and Microsoft to puns and jokes especially since Microsoft 's marketing slogan at the time was \" where do you want to go today ? \" with the PC being dubbed Pee-C. The Herald Sun wrote that the \" iLoo is , unquestionably , very good news \u2013 mainly to journalists with a bottomless pit of laboured bum jokes \" while the Seattle Times wrote \" now the company has a credibility problem as well as a red face . \" Other newspapers issued humorous headlines : Microsoft technology headed for toilet from the San Francisco Chronicle , Toilet mixes zeroes with ones and twos from the Washington Post , and Microsoft 's Gone Potty from The Daily Mirror . The product has since been studied as an example of a public relations disaster and an example of an internet hoax . Microsoft 's public relations response to the debacle is also considered to be one of the poorest in the company 's history , given Microsoft 's reputation for micro-managing news releases , interviews and promotional events . The iLoo 's negative publicity drowned out the launch of MSN Radio Plus on May 12 , 2003 . It has since inspired a number of spoofs . = = i-Loo controversy = = After reading an article about the iLoo , Andrew Cubitt , inventor of the similarly named i-Loo , wrote to The Inquirer stating that iLoo \" sounds remarkably similar ... it now seems that the clever people at Microsoft have cottoned onto the idea and even call it the i-Loo , the same as mine ! \" Cubitt went on to say that \" mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do , but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn 't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons \" . The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University . In an interview with The Inquirer , he noted \" As it was designed at the university , they own the partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft ' invention ' very closely . \" Microsoft never formally commented on Cubitt 's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April 's fool joke . As a result , Cubitt questioned whether this was \" a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages , or is admitting they don 't even know what time of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation ! \" Cubitt went on to state that \" as they have now discredited my idea as a joke , I will never be able to produce the idea \" and as such was \" consulting my law books now on defamatory statements \" . Neither Cubitt , nor Brunel University have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo . The i-Loo was described as : The i-Loo internet toilet roll browser is a novel and unique product designed to make best use of the time you spend on the loo ! The product allows you to search the internet whilst sitting on the toilet and print out any web pages you are interested in on your toilet paper. i-Loo brings a whole new meaning to the word downloading . The unit is fixed in front of a toilet on the cubical [ sic ] wall . The product provides up to date information about new products , daily news and lottery results through an easy to navigate software package . Normal operation of the toilet and paper dispenser is evident .

                    "text": "Yelp = Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco , California . It develops , hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app , which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses , as well as the online reservation service SeatMe and online food-delivery service Eat24 . The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews , hosts social events for reviewers , and provides data about businesses , including health inspection scores . Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees , Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman . Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding . By 2010 it had $ 30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews . From 2009 \u2013 2012 , Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia . In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition . Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later . As of 2016 , Yelp.com has 135 million monthly visitors and 95 million reviews . The company 's revenues come from businesses advertising . According to BusinessWeek , Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses . Criticism regarding Yelp focus on the legitimacy of reviews , public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending , as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers . = = Company history = = = = = Origins ( 2004 \u2013 2009 ) = = = Two former PayPal employees , Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons , founded Yelp at a business incubator , MRL Ventures , in 2004 . Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network , after Stoppelman caught the flu and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor . The co-founders ' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures , Max Levchin , provided $ 1 million in initial funding . MRL co-founder David Galbraith , who instigated the local services project based on user reviews , came up with the name \" Yelp \" . According to Fortune Magazine , Yelp 's initial email-based system was \" convoluted \" . The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders ' friends and family . Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals , but were using the \" Real Reviews \" feature , which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited . According to the San Francisco Chronicle , \" the site 's popularity soared \" after it was re-designed in late 2005 . Yelp raised $ 5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and $ 10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital . The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005 , to 100,000 in 2006 . By the summer of 2006 , the site had one million monthly visitors . It raised $ 15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008 . In 2010 , Elevation Partners invested $ 100 million ; $ 75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors , while $ 25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion . Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period . By 2009 , the site had 4.5 million reviews . By 2010 , Yelp 's revenues were estimated to be $ 30 million and it employed 300 people . = = = Private company ( 2009 \u2013 2011 ) = = = Yelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009 and one for Canada that August . The first non-English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010 ; users had the option to read and write content in French or English . From 2010 to 2011 , Yelp launched several more sites , in Austria , Germany , Spain and the Netherlands . International website traffic doubled during the same time period . An Australian website went live in November 2011 . It was supported through a partnership with Telstra , which provided one million initial business listings , and was initially glitchy . Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012 , including Turkey and Denmark . Yelp 's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore , which was followed by Japan in 2014 . In December 2009 , Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company , but the two parties failed to reach an agreement . According to The New York Times , Google offered more than $ 500 million , but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $ 1 billion . Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo 's offer . Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp 's management and board of directors about the offers . In June 2015 , Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services . Yelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011 , but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation . That September , the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp 's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google 's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp . In a January 2014 agreement , Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC , but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google 's websites . = = = Public entity ( 2011 \u2013 present ) = = = In November 2011 , Yelp filed for an initial public offering ( IPO ) with the Securities Exchange Commission . On March 2 , 2012 , the company 's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange at a share price of $ 15 , valuing the company at $ 898 million . In 2012 , Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival , Qype , for $ 50 million . The following year , CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to $ 1 . Yelp acquired the start-up online reservation company SeatMe for $ 12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013 . Yelp 's second quarter 2013 revenue of $ 55 million \" exceeded expectations \" , but the company was not yet profitable . In 2012 / 13 , Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters , occupying nearly 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery ( the former PacBell building ) in San Francisco . The company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014 , as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google 's local search algorithm . It is dubbed as Google Pigeon , which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor , in getting more visibility . Over the course of the year , Yelp websites were launched in Mexico , Japan and Argentina . Also in 2014 , Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox . In early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24 , an online food-ordering service , for $ 134 million . In late 2015 , a \" Public Services & Government \" section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages . For example , the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages . Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections . Research conducted by the Boston Children 's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant . Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant-related food poisoning outbreaks . = = Features = = Yelp 's website , Yelp.com , is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site . Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan regions . The site has pages devoted to individual locations , such as restaurants or schools , where Yelp users can submit a review on their products or services using a one to five star rating system . Businesses can also update contact information , hours and other basic listing information or add special deals . In addition to writing reviews , users can react to reviews , plan events or discuss their personal lives . According to Sterling Market Intelligence , Yelp is \" one of the most important sites on the Internet . \" It has 132 million monthly visitors and 57 million reviews . As of 2010 , Yelp had an established user-base in 33 cities . 85 percent of small businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better , but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme . Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner . Users can give a review a \" thumbs-up \" if it is \" useful , funny or cool . \" Each day a \" Review of the Day \" is determined based on a vote by users . As of 2012 , 45 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device . The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008 . In August 2009 , Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle , which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera . Check-in features were added in 2010 . Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through OpenTable , a feature added in June 2010 . In 2013 , features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores and make appointments at spas . Yelp 's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple 's September 2012 release of iOS 6 . Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users . In March 2014 , Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures , flowers , golf and legal consultations , among other things , through Yelp . In October 2014 , the company , working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk , added features to book hotels through Yelp . = = = Features for businesses = = = Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008 . Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page . In some cases , Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses ' efforts to make it right . In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations . The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating , though Yelp users say this rarely occurs . A business owner can \" claim \" a profile , which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports . Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the \" check in \" feature . In 2014 , Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device . Business owners can also flag reviews to be removed , if they violate Yelp 's content guidelines . Yelp 's revenues come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses . As of 2010 , Yelp has 150 salespeople . Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results , or feature ads on the pages of their competitors . As of 2013 , advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 77 % per year . Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising . Originally a sponsored \" favorite review \" could place a positive review above negative ones , but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay . = = Relationship with businesses = = A Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each \" star \" in a Yelp rating affected the business owner 's sales by 5 \u2013 9 percent . A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours . A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews . Also , 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair , because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer . = = = Astroturfing = = = As Yelp became more influential , the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent . A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6 % of the site 's reviews in 2006 to 20 % in 2014 . Yelp 's own review filter identifies 25 percent of reviews as suspicious . Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters-out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron 's actual personal experiences , as required by the site 's Terms of Use . The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their \" first obviously fake reviews . \" Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses ' star-rating . The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews , leading to complaints from business owners . New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has \" the most aggressive \" astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into . Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works , which it says would reveal information on how to out-smart it . Yelp also conducts \" sting operations \" to uncover businesses writing their own reviews . In October 2012 , Yelp placed a 90-day \" consumer alert \" on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews . The alert read \" We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business \" . In June 2013 , Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview / AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay . In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews , saying that many of the firm 's reviews originated from their own office . The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp . An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014 . In September 2013 , Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf , a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations . = = = Alleged manipulation by Yelp = = = According to BusinessWeek , Yelp has \" always had a complicated relationship with small businesses . \" Throughout much of Yelp 's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website 's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs . Many business owners say Yelp salespeople offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising . Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried ; soon after , they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising . Yelp says its sales staff do not have the ability to modify reviews and that changes in the reviews are caused by its automated filter . Several lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products . Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial . In early 2010 , a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $ 300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews . The following month , nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit , and two similar lawsuits were filed . That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit , which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011 . Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp . The plaintiffs filed an appeal . In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal , finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers , this would not fall under the court 's legal definition of extortion . In August 2013 , Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners . Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp 's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise , receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment , and other issues . A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews . The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014 , most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise . According to Yelp , the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp 's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company . Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors ' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature . In 2015 , San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp 's alleged business practices . = = Community = = According to Inc . Magazine most reviewers ( sometimes called \" Yelpers \" ) are \" well-intentioned \" and write reviews in order to express themselves , improve their writing , or be creative . In some cases , they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike . Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors , such as being the first to review a new location , or by praise and attention from other users . Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner . Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business 's political views ; Yelp attempts to filter these . Users can give a review a \" thumbs-up \" if it is \" useful , funny or cool . \" Each day a \" Review of the Day \" is determined based on a vote by users . According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18 \u2013 25 or \" suburban baby boomers \" . Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos . Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the \" Yelp Elite Squad \" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of their reviews . Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad . They are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members . Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected . Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they 've been an elite member . The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005 , and in 2006 it was formally codified ; the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the \" Yelp Elite Squad . \" Members are invited to special opening parties , given gifts , and receive other perks . Businesses host parties for the Yelp Elite as a way of getting reviews . As of 2011 , there were 60 local Elite Squads , most in North America and Europe . Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers , mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews . In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business ; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court . Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online . The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses ' services , their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws . In 2014 , a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using \" disparagement clauses \" in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online . As of 2010 , Yelp employed a staff of 40 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers , send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners . Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity , but Yelp encourages them to do so . After leaving a negative review a user may say \" you 've been Yelped \" , while businesses with positive reviews advertise with \" People Love us on Yelp ! \" .",

TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch that was designed to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies . WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet . The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $ 46M two years after TouchWave was founded . Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom , but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful . = = History = = In 1997 , TouchWave was a privately held , venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto , California , with future entrepreneur Oliver Muoto as its marketing director . Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson , Jeff Snider , David F. Wittenkamp , and Jesper Stroe , TouchWave released its first product , WebSwitch , in 1997 . WebSwitch , a Web-based phone switch , provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations . The WebSwitch was designed to deliver significantly lower costs for communications , ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform . The timing of TouchWave 's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3 's development of its first softswitch , a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware . TouchWave made significant business and technology advances in 1998 and quickly became a recognized contributor to the VoIP industry . In March 1998 , TouchWave received the Best of Show Award at both at the Microsoft Network Telephony Forum and the Computer Telephony Expo ( Los Angeles ) for its WebSwitch product . In April , Communications Convergence magazine identified TouchWave 's WebSwitch as \" [ hinting ] at the future , where voice and data will live together on a single network . \" In July , TouchWave entered into a partnership agreement with British Telecom , the dominant fixed line telecommunications and broadband Internet provider in the United Kingdom . The partnership brought TouchWave access to technical recommendations and product feedback from British Telecom to be used to develop WebSwitch . In August , Computer Telephony awarded TouchWave its Editor 's Choice Award for the WebSwitch product . In September , TouchWave introduced a new version of WebSwitch . In October 1998 , TouchWave entered into an agreement with Telogy Networks to include Telogy 's embedded communications software in WebSwitch in order to improve the quality of its sound transmission . By the end of 1998 , TouchWave had improved its product line to where it could replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies throughout the world . By early April 1999 , TouchWave had upgraded their WebSwitch 1608 local area network distributed phone system to a product called WebSwitch 2000 . On April 13 , 1999 , Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson announced that it had purchased TouchWave for $ 46 million . In exchange for the $ 46M , TouchWave provided Ericsson with Internet Protocol centric network products such as business phone and private business exchanges . The acquisition of TouchWave came at a time when multibillion-dollar companies were acquiring other relatively small Internet-connected companies , such as WebLine , Selsius , GeoTel , NBX , Dialogic , and Summa Four . Some employees from TouchWave eventually followed serial entrepreneur and former TouchWave president and CEO Samir Lehaff to Adomo , Inc . , a provider of voicemail majordomo services .

                    "text": "Fark = Fark is a community website created by Drew Curtis that allows members to comment on a daily batch of news articles and other items from various websites . The site receives many story submissions per day and approximately 100 of them are publicly displayed on the site , spread out over the main page and tabs ( Entertainment , Sports , Geek , Politics and Business ) . Founder Drew Curtis says the stories are selected without intentional political bias , but that he tries to run both far-left and far-right articles . Links are submitted by Fark members ( collectively referred to as \" Farkers \" ) , which admins can approve ( \" greenlight \" ) for posting on either the main page or one of the subsidiary tab pages . All links ( excluding those of sponsors ) , whether approved or not , have associated threads where users can comment on the link . Greenlit links can generate upwards of 300,000 page views in one month for the recipient . This can generate such an enormous amount of traffic in such a short time that smaller websites are often rendered inoperable due to congestion or simple server failure . This is colloquially referred to as the website being \" farked \" by the community . = = History = = Fark was created in 1999 by Drew Curtis of Lexington , Kentucky . Curtis states that the word \" fark \" originated either from a chat room euphemism for \" f * * k \" or from a drunken misspelling ; although he tells people it is the former because it is a \" better story that way \" . He registered Fark.com in September 1997 , when a friend mentioned that all of the four letter domain names were disappearing . Originally , Fark contained no content except for an image of a squirrel with large testicles . This photograph is that of a Cape Ground Squirrel in Etosha National Park , Namibia , taken by photographer Kevin Shafer , who at the time worked for the Corbis Corporation , ca . 1993 . The squirrel image is no longer used in the production area of the site , but it can still be found as the server 's 404 error for pages that do not exist . Since 1993 , Curtis had frequently read morning news stories and exchanged them with friends . Although this would later become the inspiration for Fark , Curtis toyed with the idea of starting an online curry recipe database . In 1999 , eighteen months after registering the domain name , he launched Fark as a way to share interesting news postings with his friends rather than sending them numerous emails . The first story posted was an article about a fighter pilot who crashed while attempting to moon another fighter pilot . During Fark 's first year , the site received over 50,000 page views and one million the year after . Features such as link submission and forums were added as popularity and participation grew . By January 2008 , according to Curtis , the site was averaging an estimated 52 million page views per month from 4 million unique visitors . Fark was officially incorporated in the state of Delaware as , \" Fark , Inc . \" , on January 31 , 2008 . While most of the story links on the main page are submitted by users and selected for placement based on merit , there was an incident in August 2004 in which Fark was accused of selling preferential placement of story links on the main page . The accusation stemmed from an exchange between Mahalo.com CEO Jason Calacanis and third party sales employee Gogi Gupta , where Gupta claimed Calacanis could buy an editorial on Fark for $ 300 to $ 400 . Curtis dismissed the incident as the result of an overenthusiastic salesperson , and subsequently fired Gupta . Gupta worked for a company called Gupta Media and did not have the authority to speak for Fark , according to Curtis . Curtis launched Foobies.com in 2006 as a NSFW ( not safe for work ) offshoot of Fark , primarily because advertisers complained about links to female breasts on the main site . Customers could purchase NSFW links through Foobies at the price of $ 400 per link . Fark launched Fark TV on January 17 , 2007 . The first video was a spoof ad for a mock product called \" Meth Coffee . \" In May 2008 , Turner Broadcasting announced that it would be folding SuperDeluxe , Fark TV 's host site , into the Adult Swim brand , and laying off most of the staff , effectively canceling Fark TV . A new design for the website was launched on April 25 , 2007 , with the comment , \" Fark site redesign is now live . Hope nothing breaks , we 're all out drinking . \" The new design was initially received with some controversy by many users , mostly due to the change in layout and a seemingly indifferent attitude by site moderators to user impact or feedback . In response , Drew Curtis noted the following reasons for the redesign : \" Websites have to evolve over time . Otherwise you end up with a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report . The old design was put into place years ago , over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof . It was time to reformat and remove a bunch of the clutter while trying to keep the core design intact . \" The site layout was refined over the next few weeks in accordance with many suggestions . Curtis published the book , It 's Not News , It 's Fark : How Mass Media Tries to Pass off Crap as News in May 2007 . The book critically explores the mass media industry and the go-to stories used when there is a lack of hard news to report . It sold 25,000 copies in its first 12 weeks on the market . Despite its initial strong reception , the book only received mild attention from reviewers . Salon.com gave it a favorable review , although the only major newspaper to review it was the Tucson Citizen , which only gave it a mini-review . On November 24 , 2009 , Fark launched a new partnership with USA Today , as they became the exclusive host and sponsor of Fark 's Geek Page , a collection of technology-related links . This represents the site 's first content partnership with a major media brand . Previously , Curtis had signed a sales only deal with Maxim Online . The page shows aggregated technology news headlines from other news sources with USA Today 's Tech section branding . Its right column displays technology content from USA Today with video clips and a headline widget of USAToday.com 's Tech Live and Game Hunters stories . In January 2011 , Fark was sued in Los Angeles Federal Court by Gooseberry Natural Resources , LLC , for allegedly violating US Patent No. 6,370,535 , titled , \" System and method for structured news release generation and distribution . \" This patent , awarded in 2002 , involves typing text into an administration system , storing it on a server , and publishing it on the Internet . Other defendants sued in the case include Reddit , The Atlanta-Journal Constitution , Digg , Geeknet ( owner of Slashdot ) , TechCrunch , Newsvine , and Yahoo . Drew Curtis argued that Fark does not produce \" news releases \" or \" press releases \" , as the lawsuit stated , and instead provides a forum for humorous links to stories on other websites . The case was settled in August 2011 , for the sum of $ 0 . Curtis later described the entire ordeal as , \" a nightmare \" , saying , \" Imagine someone breaking into your home , then being forced to sit on the couch while their lawyers file motions over how much stuff they can take . \" At the 2012 TED Conference in Long Beach , California , he referred to patent trolls as \" terrorists \" , comparing them to the Abu Sayyaf terror group in the Philippines , which kidnapped people for ransom , collected small sums of money , expanded with more personnel and equipment , and then kidnapped more people for higher ransoms . Fark tweaked its site design a little more on June 1 , 2011 , with the comment , \" Fark 's redesign will go live at 5PM EST . Heads-up for those of you who missed the other warning threads and need a place to completely lose your mind . \" Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign , Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week ( two weeks for TotalFark users ) prior to June 1 , to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken . The primary reason for the redesigned site is to make it easier to use and more intuitive . The site 's tagline was changed from \" It 's not news , it 's FARK \" to \" We don 't make news . We mock it . \" The music tab was also dropped , due to low usage \u2013 content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab , where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway . An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time , but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site . An official iPhone app , \" HEY ! on Fark \" , was released on June 11 , 2012 , for the iPhone , iPad , and iPod Touch . The app enables users to receive notifications on various stories appearing on Fark by topic or keyword , as well as allows users to comment on stories . It also lets users set a \" snooze \" option , or a period of time when notifications will not be sent ( e.g. for sleeping or work ) . An app for Android phones is also planned . Other iOS apps are also available allowing users to browse the site , including , \" Mobile Reader for FARK \u00ae \" and , \" Fark \u00ae Not News \" , although these are not official apps . = = Administration = = Compared to other popular websites , such as Daily Kos and del.icio.us , Fark is a relatively small operation , run more or less singlehandedly by founder Drew Curtis from his home near Lexington , Kentucky . The site earns revenue from advertising and membership in its TotalFark program . Although Curtis won 't release official revenue figures , he estimated that , in 2006 , the site earned just under $ 600,000 per year . Its classifieds section alone generates as much as $ 40,000 per year . Technology writer Mathew Ingram described Fark as \" staggeringly successful \" and noted the disparity between Fark 's revenue and the amount of press given to sites like Digg . Fark has also spoken about its steady , above average CPMs . Despite a fairly high revenue , Drew takes a yearly salary of just $ 60,000 . The rest of the money goes to the site 's legal \" war chest \" as well as to pay other expenses such as hosting , website design , and forum moderation . Curtis has used public relations to drive traffic , including interviews every Friday on TechTV for one to one and a half years ( ca . 2002 \u2013 2003 ) about the three weirdest tech-oriented stories of the week . = = Features = = = = = Tags = = = Submitters can give stories several different tags , such as stupid , interesting , obvious , or dumbass . Tags that say photoshop , audioedit or videoedit are used for threads where digital content is edited for a humorous or artistic effect . In addition , the newsflash tag is used for news which is a matter of important breaking news , and an email is sent to the administrators notifying them that someone has submitted a newsflash . Due to the large amount of headlines submitted to the site from the state of Florida , and because \" so many stupid things happen in Florida , it deserved its own Fark tag , \" the Florida tag was created at the suggestion of users . Similarly , articles discussing Wil Wheaton \u2013 a Fark user himself \u2013 are given the Wheaton tag and articles discussing Christopher Walken are occasionally given the Walken tag , though Walken has never participated on Fark . On August 19 , 2008 , a new fail tag was introduced , to be used for submitted articles where the subject does something ignorant or when a major gaffe occurs . A new Caturday tag was introduced to in recognition of the caturday meme on December 21 , 2009 . = = = TotalFark = = = In February 2002 , Curtis introduced TotalFark as a subscription service , charging $ 5 per month . By May 2007 there were an estimated 2,000 subscribers , generating $ 120,000 per year . Subscribers , known collectively as TotalFarkers or TFers , at one time had the privilege of seeing and commenting on all links submitted to the site , as opposed to only those approved for inclusion on the main page . However , as of 2010 an estimated 40 % of links submitted to TotalFark are deleted within one minute of being submitted . In a typical 24-hour period , TotalFark 's main page includes 1,200 to 1,800 links with associated comment threads , whereas Fark 's main page includes only 60 to 80 links from that total . Subscribers who purchase a 6- or 12-month subscription are also eligible to receive an @ ultrafark.com email address . The UltraFark email service is provided through Google 's Gmail service . = = = Farkisms and clich\u00e9s = = = Fark 's comment threads are often littered with various Farkisms or clich\u00e9s . These are essentially in-jokes which either originated on Fark or on other sites ( such as 4chan or Something Awful ) that have become an integral part of the community culture and used in myriad discussions in the forums , regardless of whether they apply to the topic at hand . Several groups of people seem to take a bit more abuse than others on the site , including PETA , Catholic priests , the French , and Duke University , according to Curtis . The site has also become somewhat well known for including \" NSFW \" ( Not Safe For Work ) in the headlines of links that contain images or videos of a sensitive nature , and in 2007 , attempted to file a trademark of the phrase . Fark was also involved in organizing the Rickrolling of the New York Mets in April 2008 , when they encouraged readers to vote for Rick Astley 's Never Gonna Give You Up as the song to be played during every home game of the 2008 season . One particularly notable Farkism involves the acronym UFIA ( Unsolicited Finger In Anus ) , which became a clich\u00e9 after an article making the main page misquoted a judge using the line . UFIA was prominently used again in February 2005 , when Drew Curtis purchased the naming rights to the Fleet Center ( now TD Garden ) in Boston , Massachusetts for the single day of February 28 , 2005 . The consensus choice of Fark 's readers was that it should be re-dubbed the \" Fark.com UFIA Center \" . In the end , however , Boston Garden was chosen as the name due to obscenity concerns . In April 2006 , a Fark member convinced the Tennessee Department of Transportation to erect an Adopt a Highway sign in the name of UFIA on the two miles of State Route 63 west of the intersection of SR 63 and U.S. Route 25E . The Department required a definition of UFIA , which was explained as , \" Uniting Friends in America . \" The sign remained up for a few days , but was ultimately removed once authorities were informed of the origins of the acronym . Another popular Farkism involves KABC-TV Consumer Specialist Ric Romero , which began on October 19 , 2005 , when he wrote a news story on the \" new \" internet phenomenon of blogging . The story was then picked up by Fark , where he was ridiculed for posting a story about something that many people did not consider \" news \" and was actually quite obvious . Over the course of the next several years , he became somewhat of a meme on the site , as Farkers would post links to his stories , along with his photo , and a brief caption stating something obvious that everyone already knew . On December 7 , 2009 , Drew Curtis discovered his Facebook fan page , which led Ric to ask the Farkers that joined his new Facebook page to donate to the Spark of Love Toy Drive , which subsequently resulted in 582 online donations totaling $ 13,659.20 by December 16 , 2009 . Romero thanked the Fark community on the news for their donations , and recognized his status as a Farkism , also reporting the \" breaking news \" that \" Water is Wet . \" = = = Photoshop contests = = = The site features regular Photoshop contests , in which users use a graphical editing program ( such as Adobe Photoshop , from which the contest draws its name ) to manipulate an image provided by the creator of the contest . A similar site , Something Awful , sponsors Photoshop Phriday contests . The image is usually manipulated for humorous effect , but can also be edited to create an aesthetically pleasing image or to showcase a poster 's image manipulation skill , which is then voted on by others in the forum . = = = Fark Parties = = = At periodic intervals throughout the year , Fark Parties are organized , usually in conjunction with the travels of Curtis . The practice began in 1999 , when Curtis was doing some database consulting in Spartanburg , South Carolina . Staying in a hotel with nothing to do , he posted a note up on the site asking anybody who lived in the area to email him if they wanted to join him for a beer . = = = FarkIt = = = \" FarkIt \" or \" Fark This \" is a method of submitting information that increases its chances of being seen on the Fark web site . A FarkIt button appears on a web site , and links submitted through this button go to a different database . The Fark web site gives priority to submissions from sites that clearly show the button . This might mean that the URL of a particular article will be that of the site showing the button , rather than one which does not , even if the site without the button was the first from which the given article was submitted . = = Traffic and users = = As of June 2009 , the site received approximately three to four million unique visitors per month , and garnered 60 million page views and 75 million outbound links . This put it in the top 100 of English language websites . Fark 's Alexa rating was 2,310 , with the average user spending 5.8 minutes per day on the site and 5,337 sites linking in . 67.2 % of users originate from the United States . The site receives approximately 2,000 story submissions per day from users , and approximately 50 of them are displayed on the main page of the site , or \" green-lighted \" . Subscribers to the subscription TotalFark service , are able to view all 2,000 submissions per day for a $ 5 per month fee . There are around 500,000 user accounts on the site ( including both TotalFark as well as unpaid accounts ) , although only about 5 % actually read comments , and only 1 % actually post in the forums . Greenlit links can generate upwards of 300,000 page views in one month for the recipient , which is such an enormous amount of traffic that smaller websites are often \" farked \" , meaning that their servers have crashed . Normally , in the absence of serious news , comments in the forums on the site tend to be of a more sophomoric nature . However , during major events such as the September 11 attacks or the Hurricane Katrina aftermath , usage spikes and the site can actually be seen as a more serious outlet for news . Some users can also contribute greatly to reporting actual events ; for instance , the citizen journalism of the events during the 2009 Iranian election protests was recognized by several major media outlets . In response to this coverage , Drew Curtis placed a green band on the letter \" K \" in the site 's logo at the top of the page , to show support for Mir-Hossein Mousavi . In a June 2009 interview , Curtis said that almost all traffic coming from the People 's Republic of China and India was from spammers , so he blocked both countries from the site . = = Publicity = = As the site 's popularity grew , Fark appeared many times in popular media outlets . In 2006 , Curtis and Fark were featured on the cover of Business 2.0 magazine as part of the feature story about successful websites . In 2007 and 2009 , Fark was referenced on the game show Jeopardy ! , with a category entitled \" Fark.com Headlines . \" The site is also frequently used as a humorous source for news by many radio stations , as well as late night comedy shows . However , much to Drew Curtis ' dismay , it is very rarely cited as a source for many of these stories . Several celebrities have also stated that they either checked the website regularly or participated in its discussion forums using an account . Some of these celebrities include Alan Colmes of Fox News , Mythbusters co-host Adam Savage , science fiction author John Scalzi , and actor Wil Wheaton .",

                    "text": "Twitter = Twitter ( / \u02c8tw\u026at\u0259r / ) is an online social networking service that enables users to send and read short 140-character messages called \" tweets \" . Registered users can read and post tweets , but those who are unregistered can only read them . Users access Twitter through the website interface , SMS or mobile device app . Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco and has more than 25 offices around the world . Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey , Evan Williams , Biz Stone , and Noah Glass and launched in July 2006 . The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity , with more than 100 million users posting 340 million tweets a day in 2012 . The service also handled 1.6 billion search queries per day . In 2013 , it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as \" the SMS of the Internet \" . As of March 2016 , Twitter has more than 310 million monthly active users . = = History = = = = = Creation and initial reaction = = = Twitter 's origins lie in a \" daylong brainstorming session \" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo . Jack Dorsey , then an undergraduate student at New York University , introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group . The original project code name for the service was twttr , an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass , inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes . The decision was also partly due to the fact that domain twitter.com was already in use , and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter . The developers initially considered \" 10958 \" as a short code , but later changed it to \" 40404 \" for \" ease of use and memorability \" . Work on the project started on March 21 , 2006 , when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9 : 50 PM Pacific Standard Time ( PST ) : \" just setting up my twttr \" . Dorsey has explained the origin of the \" Twitter \" title : ... we came across the word ' twitter ' , and it was just perfect . The definition was ' a short burst of inconsequential information , ' and ' chirps from birds ' . And that 's exactly what the product was . The first Twitter prototype , developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber , was used as an internal service for Odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15 , 2006 . In October 2006 , Biz Stone , Evan Williams , Dorsey , and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo , together with its assets \u2014 including Odeo.com and Twitter.com \u2014 from the investors and shareholders . Williams fired Glass , who was silent about his part in Twitter 's startup until 2011 . Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007 . Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview : With Twitter , it wasn 't clear what it was . They called it a social network , they called it microblogging , but it was hard to define , because it didn 't replace anything . There was this path of discovery with something like that , where over time you figure out what it is . Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning , which we described as status updates and a social utility . It is that , in part , but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network . The tipping point for Twitter 's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive ( SXSWi ) conference . During the event , Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000 . \" The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways , exclusively streaming Twitter messages , \" remarked Newsweek 's Steven Levy . \" Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters . Panelists and speakers mentioned the service , and the bloggers in attendance touted it . \" Reaction at the conference was highly positive . Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was \" absolutely ruling \" SXSWi . Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was \" owning \" the conference . Twitter staff received the festival 's Web Award prize with the remark \" we 'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less . And we just did ! \" The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22 , 2010 . By late November 2010 , an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts ' communal account , @ NASA _ Astronauts . NASA has also hosted over 25 \" tweetups \" , events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants ' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA . In August 2010 , the company appointed Adam Bain from News Corp. ' s Fox Audience Network as president of revenue . = = = Growth = = = The company experienced rapid initial growth . It had 400,000 tweets posted per quarter in 2007 . This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008 . In February 2010 , Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day . By March 2010 , the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications . As of June 2010 , about 65 million tweets were posted each day , equaling about 750 tweets sent each second , according to Twitter . As of March 2011 , that was about 140 million tweets posted daily . As noted on Compete.com , Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second . Twitter 's usage spikes during prominent events . For example , a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14 . The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers ' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17 , and then again at the close of Japan 's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per second . The record was set again during the 2011 FIFA Women 's World Cup Final between Japan and the United States , when 7,196 tweets per second were published . When American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25 , 2009 , Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words \" Michael Jackson \" at a rate of 100,000 tweets per hour . The current record as of August 3 , 2013 was set in Japan , with 143,199 tweets per second during a television screening of the movie Castle in the Sky ( beating the previous record of 33,388 , also set by Japan for the television screening of the same movie ) . Twitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11 , 2010 . Atebits had developed the Apple Design Award-winning Twitter client Tweetie for the Mac and iPhone . The application , now called \" Twitter \" and distributed free of charge , is the official Twitter client for the iPhone , iPad and Mac . From September through October 2010 , the company began rolling out \" New Twitter \" , an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including YouTube and Flickr , and a complete overhaul of the interface , which shifted links such as ' @ mentions ' and ' Retweets ' above the Twitter stream , while ' Messages ' and ' Log Out ' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com. As of November 1 , 2010 , the company confirmed that the \" New Twitter experience \" had been rolled out to all users . = = = = 2011 \u2013 2014 = = = = On April 5 , 2011 , Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the \" Old Twitter \" . However , a glitch came about after the page was launched , so the previous \" retro \" homepage was still in use until the issues were resolved ; the new homepage was reintroduced on April 20 . On December 8 , 2011 , Twitter overhauled its website once more to feature the \" Fly \" design , which the service says is easier for new users to follow and promotes advertising . In addition to the Home tab , the Connect and Discover tabs were introduced along with a redesigned profile and timeline of Tweets . The site 's layout has been compared to that of Facebook . On February 21 , 2012 , it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership . Yandex , a Russian search engine , finds value within the partnership due to Twitter 's real time news feeds . Twitter 's director of business development explained that it is important to have Twitter content where Twitter users go . On March 21 , 2012 , Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday while also announcing that it has 140 million users and sees 340 million tweets per day . The number of users is up 40 % from their September 2011 number , which was said to have been at 100 million at the time . In April 2012 , Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit , with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies . Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin . On June 5 , 2012 , a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog , removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter . On October 5 , 2012 , Twitter acquired a video clip company called Vine that launched in January 2013 . Twitter released Vine as a standalone app that allows users to create and share six-second looping video clips on January 24 , 2013 . Vine videos shared on Twitter are visible directly in users ' Twitter feeds . Due to an influx of inappropriate content , it is now rated 17 + in Apple 's app store . On December 18 , 2012 , Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users . Twitter hit 100 million monthly active users in September 2011 .

The IPO filing states that \" 200,000,000 + monthly active users \" access Twitter and \" 500,000,000 + tweets per day \" are posted . In an October 15 , 2013 amendment to their SEC S-1 filing , Twitter declared that they would list on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) , quashing speculation that their stock would trade on the NASDAQ exchange . This decision was widely viewed to be a reaction to the botched initial public offering of Facebook . On November 6 , 2013 , 70 million shares were priced at US $ 26 and issued by lead underwriter Goldman Sachs . On November 7 , 2013 , the first day of trading on the NYSE , Twitter shares opened at $ 26.00 and closed at US $ 44.90 , giving the company a valuation of around US $ 31 billion . This was $ 18.90 above the initial offering price and Twitter ended with a market capitalization of $ 24.46 billion . The paperwork from show of November 7s that among the founders , Williams received a sum of US $ 2.56 billion and Dorsey received US $ 1.05 billion , while Costolo 's payment was US $ 345 million . As of December 13 , 2013 , Twitter had \" a market capitalization of $ 32.76 billion \" . On February 5 , 2014 , Twitter published its first results as a public company , showing a net loss of $ 511 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 . On January 5 , 2016 , CEO Jack Dorsey commented on a report that Twitter planned to expand its character limit to 10,000 ( private messages already had the longer limit as of July ) , requiring users to click to see anything beyond 140 characters . He said while Twitter would \" never lose that feeling \" of speed , users could do more with the text . = = Leadership = = As chief executive officer , Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company . On October 16 , 2008 , Williams took over the role of CEO , and Dorsey became chairman of the board . On October 4 , 2010 , Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO . Dick Costolo , formerly Twitter 's chief operating officer , became CEO . On October 4 , 2010 , Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and \" be completely focused on product strategy \" . According to The New York Times , \" Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship \" when Williams was away . According to PC Magazine , Williams was \" no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company \" . He was focused on developing a new startup , and became a member of Twitter 's board of directors , and promised to \" help in any way I can \" . In 2011 , Stone was still with Twitter but was working with AOL as an \" advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy \" . In January 2014 Stone announced the release of Jelly , a ' social Q & A network for mobile ' . Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011 , as executive chairman focusing on product development . At that time he split his schedule with Square ( where he is CEO ) , whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter 's in San Francisco . In September 2011 , board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter 's Board of Directors . In October 2012 , Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development . Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company 's CFO in July 2014 , with an \" annual salary of $ 250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $ 61.5 million \" . On June 10 , 2015 , Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1 , 2015 . Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo . On October 14 , 2015 , former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman , replacing Dorsey who remains CEO . On January 26 , 2016 , Leslie Berland , former executive vice president of global advertising , marketing , and digital partnerships at American Express , was named chief marketing officer . = = Logo = = Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo . The original logo was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010 . A slightly modified version succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign . On February 27 , 2012 , a tweet from an employee that works on the company 's platform and API discussed the evolution of the \" Larry the Bird \" logo with Twitter 's creative director and it was revealed that it was named after Larry Bird of the NBA 's Boston Celtics fame . This detail had been confirmed when the Boston Celtics ' director of interactive media asked Twitter co-founder Biz Stone about it in August 2011 . On June 5 , 2012 , Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign , replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon simply named as the \" Twitter Bird \" . As of this logo revision , the word \" Twitter \" and the lowercase letter \" t \" are no longer used , with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company 's branding . According to Douglas Bowman , designer of Twitter , the new logo resembles a mountain bluebird . Twitter explains on their website not to modify the logo ( e.g. rotate the bird , change the logo 's color , etc . ) . = = Features = = = = = Tweets = = = Tweets are publicly visible by default , but senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers . Users can tweet via the Twitter website , compatible external applications ( such as for smartphones ) , or by Short Message Service ( SMS ) available in certain countries . Users may subscribe to other users ' tweets \u2014 this is known as \" following \" and subscribers are known as \" followers \" or \" tweeps \" , a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps . Individual tweets can be forwarded by other users to their own feed , a process known as a \" retweet \" . Users can also \" like \" ( formerly \" favorite \" ) individual tweets . Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets . Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) client . In a 2009 Time essay , technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as \" remarkably simple \" : As a social network , Twitter revolves around the principle of followers . When you choose to follow another Twitter user , that user 's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page . If you follow 20 people , you 'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page : breakfast-cereal updates , interesting new links , music recommendations , even musings on the future of education . According to research published in April 2014 , around 44 percent of user accounts have never tweeted . = = = = Content = = = = San Antonio-based market-research firm Pear Analytics analyzed 2,000 tweets ( originating from the United States and in English ) over a two-week period in August 2009 from 11 : 00 am to 5 : 00 pm ( CST ) and separated them into six categories : Pointless babble \u2013 40 % Conversational \u2013 38 % Pass-along value \u2013 9 % Self-promotion \u2013 6 % Spam \u2013 4 % News \u2013 4 % Despite Jack Dorsey 's own open contention that a message on Twitter is \" a short burst of inconsequential information \" , social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labelled \" pointless babble \" is better characterized as \" social grooming \" and / or \" peripheral awareness \" ( which she justifies as persons \" want [ ing ] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling , even when co-presence isn 't viable \" ) . Similarly , a survey of Twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers . = = = = Format = = = = Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags \u2013 words or phrases prefixed with a \" # \" sign . Similarly , the \" @ \" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users . To repost a message from another Twitter user and share it with one 's own followers , a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet . In late 2009 , the \" Twitter Lists \" feature was added , making it possible for users to follow ad hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors . Through SMS , users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers : short codes for the United States , Canada , India , New Zealand , and an Isle of Man-based number for international use . There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone , O2 and Orange networks . In India , since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel , an alternative platform called smsTweet was set up by a user to work on all networks . A similar platform called GladlyCast exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia . The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging , introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages . The 140-character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly , goo.gl , and tr.im , and content-hosting services , such as Twitpic , memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters . Since June 2011 , Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its website , making other link shorteners superfluous for staying within the 140 character limit . On May 24 , 2016 , Twitter announced that media such as photos and videos , and the person 's handle , would not count against the 140 character limit . A user photo post used to count for about 24 characters . Attachments and links will also no longer be part of the character limit . On July 17 , Twitter will launch a new way for advertisers to target users that have tweeted with a certain emoji or engaged with tweets with a certain emoji . = = = = Trending topics = = = = A word , phrase or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a \" trending topic \" . Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users , or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic . These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people 's opinions are about it . Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena , particularly musicians like Lady Gaga ( known as Little Monsters ) , Justin Bieber ( Beliebers ) , and One Direction ( Directioners ) , and fans of the Twilight ( Twihards ) , Rihanna fans ( Rih Navy ) , and Harry Potter ( Potterheads ) novels . Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type , with limited success . The Twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page , along with sponsored content ( see image ) . Twitter often censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive . Twitter censored the # Thatsafrican and # thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive . There are allegations that Twitter removed # NaMOinHyd from the trending list and added an Indian National Congress-sponsored hashtag . = = = Adding and following content = = = There are numerous tools for adding content , monitoring content and conversations including Telly ( video sharing , old name is Twitvid ) , TweetDeck , Salesforce.com , HootSuite , and Twitterfeed . As of 2009 , fewer than half of tweets posted were posted using the web user interface with most users using third-party applications ( based on an analysis of 500 million tweets by Sysomos ) . = = = Verified accounts = = = A verified Twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account \u2014 the aim of the \" verified \" status is to prove that a real-world person or company is not being impersonated , through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the top-right corner of a user 's page , or next to the username in the platform 's Search function . Twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark , and it is frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics , music , movies , business , fashion , government , sports , media , and journalism . The owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard Twitter-account holders . These features include : The ability to choose how their notifications and mentions are presented . Since verified accounts typically receive a lot of followers , account holders can filter these notices based on whether or not they are from verified accounts . The ability to view information about their followers and their involvement on Twitter . The ability to receive direct messages from all followers or only selected followers . In a breach of Twitter 's rules , some users placed the verified checkmark in their background \u2014 Twitter confirmed that such conduct is invalid . Following a design update of the Twitter platform , it is more difficult for users to impersonate a verified account because of the layout . A limitation of the verified status is that if the account is hacked , the person or company can still be impersonated for a limited time , until control is regained over the account by the legitimate owners \u2013 as happened , for example , with Tesla Motors ' Twitter account briefly in 2015 . = = = Mobile = = = Twitter has mobile apps for iPhone , iPad , Android , Windows 10 , Windows Phone , BlackBerry , Firefox OS , and Nokia S40 . There is also version of the website for mobile devices , SMS and MMS service . For many years , Twitter has limited the use of third party applications accessing the service by implementing a 100,000 user limit per application . = = = Authentication = = = Since August 31 , 2010 , third-party Twitter applications have been required to use OAuth , an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application . The OAuth authentication method used to be optional , but it is now compulsory and the user-name / password authentication method has been made redundant and is no longer functional . Twitter stated that the move to OAuth will mean \" increased security and a better experience \" . = = = Related headlines feature = = = This feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet 's permalink page . If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories , the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet . This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn 't understand what the tweet means , they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about . = = = Polls = = = On October 21 , 2015 , Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets . Polls are open for 24 hours , and voters are not personally identified . = = Usage = = = = = Rankings = = = Twitter is ranked as one of the ten-most-visited websites worldwide by Alexa 's web traffic analysis . Daily user estimates vary as the company does not publish statistics on active accounts . A February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits . In March 2009 , a Nielsen.com blog ranked Twitter as the fastest-growing website in the Member Communities category for February 2009 . Twitter had annual growth of 1,382 percent , increasing from 475,000 unique visitors in February 2008 to 7 million in February 2009 . In 2009 , Twitter had a monthly user retention rate of forty percent . = = = Demographics = = = In 2009 , Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter , said Jeremiah Owyang , an industry analyst studying social media . \" Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years , \" he said . According to comScore only eleven percent of Twitter 's users are aged twelve to seventeen. comScore attributed this to Twitter 's \" early adopter period \" when the social network first gained popularity in business settings and news outlets attracting primarily older users . However , comScore also stated in 2009 that Twitter had begun to \" filter more into the mainstream \" , and \" along with it came a culture of celebrity as Shaq , Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher joined the ranks of the Twitterati \" . According to a study by Sysomos in June 2009 , women make up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men \u2014 fifty-three percent over forty-seven percent . It also stated that five percent of users accounted for seventy-five percent of all activity , and that New York City has more Twitter users than other cities . According to Quancast , twenty-seven million people in the US used Twitter as of September 3 , 2009 . Sixty-three percent of Twitter users are under thirty-five years old ; sixty percent of Twitter users are Caucasian , but a higher than average ( compared to other Internet properties ) are African American / black ( sixteen percent ) and Hispanic ( eleven percent ) ; fifty-eight percent of Twitter users have a total household income of at least US $ 60,000 . The prevalence of African American Twitter usage and in many popular hashtags has been the subject of research studies . On September 7 , 2011 , Twitter announced that it has 100 million active users logging in at least once a month and 50 million active users every day . In an article published on January 6 , 2012 , Twitter was confirmed to be the biggest social media network in Japan , with Facebook following closely in second. comScore confirmed this , stating that Japan is the only country in the world where Twitter leads Facebook . On March 31 , 2014 , Twitter announced there were 255 million monthly active users ( MAUs ) and 198 million mobile MAUs . In 2013 , there were over 100 million users actively using Twitter daily and about 500 million Tweets every day , with about 29 % of users checking Twitter multiple times a day . In 2012 , the country with the most active users on Twitter was the United States . = = Finances = = = = = Funding = = = Twitter raised over US $ 57 million from venture capitalist growth funding , although exact numbers are not publicly disclosed . Twitter 's first A round of funding was for an undisclosed amount that is rumored to have been between US $ 1 million and US $ 5 million . Its second B round of funding in 2008 was for US $ 22 million and its third C round of funding in 2009 was for US $ 35 million from Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital along with an undisclosed amount from other investors including Union Square Ventures , Spark Capital , and Insight Venture Partners . Twitter is backed by Union Square Ventures , Digital Garage , Spark Capital , and Bezos Expeditions . In May 2008 , The Industry Standard remarked that Twitter 's long-term viability is limited by a lack of revenue . Twitter board member Todd Chaffee forecast that the company could profit from e-commerce , noting that users may want to buy items directly from Twitter since it already provides product recommendations and promotions . By March 2009 communications consultant Bill Douglass predicted in an interview that Twitter would be worth $ 1 billion within six months , which came to pass when the company closed a financing round valuing it at $ 1 billion in September of that year . The company raised US $ 200 million in new venture capital in December 2010 , at a valuation of approximately US $ 3.7 billion . In March 2011 , 35,000 Twitter shares sold for US $ 34.50 each on Sharespost , an implied valuation of US $ 7.8 billion . In August 2010 Twitter announced a \" significant \" investment led by Digital Sky Technologies that , at US $ 800 million , was reported to be the largest venture round in history . In December 2011 , the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal invested $ 300 million in Twitter . The company was valued at $ 8.4 billion at the time . = = = Revenue sources = = = In July 2009 , some of Twitter 's revenue and user growth documents were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll . The documents projected 2009 revenues of US $ 400,000 in the third quarter and US $ 4 million in the fourth quarter along with 25 million users by the end of the year . The projections for the end of 2013 were US $ 1.54 billion in revenue , US $ 111 million in net earnings , and 1 billion users . No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published . In response , Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker . On April 13 , 2010 , Twitter announced plans to offer paid advertising for companies that would be able to purchase \" promoted tweets \" to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website , similar to Google Adwords ' advertising model . As of April 13 , Twitter announced it had already signed up a number of companies wishing to advertise , including Sony Pictures , Red Bull , Best Buy , and Starbucks . The company generated US $ 45 million in annual revenue in 2010 , after beginning sales midway through that year ; the company operated at a loss through most of 2010 . Users ' photos can generate royalty-free revenue for Twitter , and an agreement with World Entertainment News Network ( WENN ) was announced in May 2011 . In June 2011 , Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self-service advertising system . Twitter generated US $ 139.5 million in advertising sales during 2011 . The self-service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite-only basis . Twitter later reported that numerous small businesses and people who used the self-service tool provided feedback that indicated they were impressed by the feature . To continue their advertising campaign , Twitter announced on March 20 , 2012 that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices . In April 2013 , Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self-service platform , consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts , was available to all U.S. users without an invite . Twitter 's financial revenue statistics for the first quarter of 2014 was reported as US $ 250 million . = = Technology = = = = = Implementation = = = Twitter places great reliance on open-source software . The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework , deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby . In the early days of Twitter , tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded ( large databases were split based on time of posting ) . After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases , the company decided that the system needed re-engineering . As of April 6 , 2011 , Twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack , to a Java server they call Blender . From Spring 2007 to 2008 the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling , but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala . The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200 \u2013 300 requests per second per host to around 10,000 \u2013 20,000 requests per second per host . This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter 's engineers envisioned when starting the switch . The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls . Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake , and geolocation data is added using ' Rockdove ' . The URL shortner t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL . Next , the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard , and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent . Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API . The process itself is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms . On August 16 , 2013 , Twitter 's Vice President of Platform Engineering Raffi Krikorian shared in a blog post that the company 's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week , setting a new record . Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies . The service 's application programming interface ( API ) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter . = = = Interface = = = On April 30 , 2009 , Twitter adjusted its web interface , adding a search bar and a sidebar of \" trending topics \" \u2014 the most common phrases appearing in messages . Biz Stone explains that all messages are instantly indexed and that \" with this newly launched feature , Twitter has become something unexpectedly important \u2013 a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now . \" In March 2012 , Twitter became available in Arabic , Farsi , Hebrew and Urdu , the first right-to-left language versions of the site . About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options . In August 2012 , beta support for Basque , Czech and Greek was added , making the site available in 33 different languages . = = = Outages = = = When Twitter experiences an outage , users once saw the \" fail whale \" error message image created by Yiying Lu , illustrating eight orange birds using a net to hoist a whale from the ocean captioned \" Too many tweets ! Please wait a moment and try again . \" In a November 2013 WIRED interview Chris Fry , VP of Engineering at that time , noted that the company had taken the \" fail whale \" out of production as the platform was now more stable . Twitter had approximately ninety-eight percent uptime in 2007 ( or about six full days of downtime ) . The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address . May 2008 : Twitter 's new engineering team made architectural changes to deal with the scale of growth . Stability issues resulted in down time or temporary feature removal . August 2008 : Twitter withdrew free SMS services from users in the United Kingdom and for approximately five months instant messaging support via a XMPP bot was listed as being \" temporarily unavailable \" . October 10 , 2008 : Twitter 's status blog announced that instant messaging ( IM ) service was no longer a temporary outage and needed to be revamped . It was announced that Twitter aims to return its IM service pending necessary major work . June 12 , 2009 : In what was called a potential \" Twitpocalypse \" , the unique numerical identifier associated with each tweet exceeded the limit of 32-bit signed integers ( 2,147,483,647 total messages ) . While Twitter itself was not affected , some third-party clients could no longer access recent tweets . Patches were quickly released , though some iPhone applications had to wait for approval from the App Store . June 25 , 2009 : Twitter ran slowly for some time after over 50,000 tweets on Michael Jackson 's death were recorded in an hour . August 6 , 2009 : Twitter and Facebook suffered from a denial-of-service attack , causing the Twitter website to go offline for several hours . It was later confirmed that the attacks were directed at one pro-Georgian user around the anniversary of the 2008 South Ossetia War , rather than the sites themselves . September 22 , 2009 : The identifier exceeded the limit for 32-bit unsigned integers ( 4,294,967,296 total messages ) again breaking some third-party clients . December 17 , 2009 : A hacking attack replaced the website 's welcoming screen with an image of a green flag and the caption \" This site has been hacked by Iranian Cyber Army \" for nearly an hour . No connection between the hackers and Iran has been established . June \u2013 July 2010 : Twitter had a very high service rejection rate ( 10 \u2013 20 % ) during the 2010 FIFA World Cup period , also , the response latency increased substantially . November 2010 : A number of accounts encountered a fault that resulted in them seeing the \" fail whale \" when they tried to log in to their accounts . The accounts themselves were not locked out as account holders could still see their \" mentions \" page , and post from there , but the timeline and a number of other features were unavailable during this outage . June 21 , 2012 : The site was down for around one hour and forty minutes , with the cause being described by Twitter as a \" cascading bug \" . July 26 , 2012 : Twitter users in the UK could not post messages for part of the day in advance of the 2012 Summer Olympics . March 2 , 2014 - During the 86th Academy Awards , Ellen DeGeneres posted a selfie of herself and other celebrities as seen on the telecast , which shut down Twitter for more than 20 minutes . = = = Privacy and security = = = Twitter messages are public , but users can also send private messages . Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public , though accounts can be changed to \" protected \" which limits this information ( and all tweets ) to approved followers . Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy . The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands . While Twitter displays no advertising , advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user . A security vulnerability was reported on April 7 , 2007 , by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith . Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication , malicious users could update someone else 's status page by using SMS spoofing . The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim 's account . Within a few weeks of this discovery , Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number ( PIN ) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages . On January 5 , 2009 , 33 high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator 's password was guessed by a dictionary attack . Falsified tweets \u2014 including sexually explicit and drug-related messages \u2014 were sent from these accounts . Twitter launched the beta version of their \" Verified Accounts \" service on June 11 , 2009 , allowing famous or notable people to announce their Twitter account name . The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status . In May 2010 , a bug was discovered by \u0130nci S\u00f6zl\u00fck that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users ' consent or knowledge . For example , comedian Conan O 'Brien 's account , which had been set to follow only one person , was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions . In response to Twitter 's security breaches , the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) brought charges against the service ; the charges were settled on June 24 , 2010 . This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses . The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users ' private information , including maintenance of a \" comprehensive information security program \" to be independently audited biannually . On December 14 , 2010 , the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks . Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement , \" ... it 's our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information , unless we are prevented by law from doing so . \" A \" MouseOver \" exploit occurred on September 21 , 2010 , when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter . When a user held the mouse cursor over blacked-out parts of a tweet , the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader 's account . The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites . The origin of the worm is unclear , but Pearce H. Delphin ( known on Twitter as @ zzap ) and a Scandinavian developer , Magnus Holm , both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user ( possibly Masato Kinugawa ) who was using it to create coloured Tweets . Kinugawa , a Japanese developer , reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14 . Later , when he found it was exploitable again , he created the account ' RainbowTwtr ' and used it to post coloured messages . Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for \" onMouseOver \" , and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself . Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for \" fun and games \" , but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals . Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13 : 50 UTC that \" The exploit is fully patched . \" Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed . In May 2011 , a claimant known as \" CTB \" ( subsequently identified as Ryan Giggs ) in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc . , Persons Unknown took legal action at the High Court of Justice in London against Twitter , requesting that Twitter release details of account holders . This followed gossip posted on Twitter about Giggs ' private life , causing conflict relating to privacy injunctions . Tony Wang , the head of Twitter in Europe , said that people who do \" bad things \" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy , and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so . He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for \" illegal activity \" on the site . On May 29 , 2011 , it was reported that South Tyneside council in England had successfully taken legal action against Twitter in a court in California , forcing Twitter to reveal the details of five user accounts . The council was trying to discover the identity of a blogger called \" Mr Monkey \" who allegedly posted libellous statements about three local councillors . On January 23 , 2012 , it was reported that Twitter would be acquiring Dasient , a startup that offers malware protection for businesses . Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website . On January 26 , 2012 , Twitter began offering a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country . Twitter cited France and Germany as examples , where pro-Nazi content is illegal . Deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries . The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover on October 18 , 2012 . The policy was used again the following day to remove anti-Semitic French tweets with the hashtag # unbonjuif ( \" a good Jew \" ) . On February 20 , 2012 , a third-party public-key encryption app ( written in Python and partially funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation ) for private messaging in Twitter , CrypTweet , was released . On May 17 , 2012 , Twitter announced it would implement the \" Do Not Track \" privacy option , a cookie-blocking feature found in Mozilla 's Firefox browser . The \" Do Not Track \" feature works only on sites that have agreed to the service . In August 2012 it was reported that there is a market in fake Twitter followers that are used to increase politicians ' and celebrities ' apparent popularity . The black market for the fake followers , known as \" bots \" , has been linked to \" nearly every politically linked account from the White House to Congress to the 2016 campaign trail \" . In June 2014 , POLITICO analyzed Twitter handles with the highest rates of fake followers : US President Barack Obama with 46.8 percent , Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz with 35.1 percent , and Senator John McCain with 23.6 percent . The culprits working to generate the fake followers , or \" bots \" , include campaign workers or friends of political candidates . One site offers 1,000 fake followers for $ 20 . The people creating the \" bots \" are often from Eastern Europe and Asia . In 2013 , two Italian researchers calculated 10 percent of total accounts on Twitter are \" bots \" however , other estimates have placed the figure even higher . In April 2013 Twitter warned news organizations around the world to secure their Twitter accounts after a number of high-profile hacks of official accounts , including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian . In May 2013 , Twitter announced a two-factor login verification as an added measure against hacking . In August 2013 , Twitter announced plans to introduce a \" report abuse \" button for all versions of the site . A petition for making the process of complaining about harassment easier had collected over 100,000 signatures . The move followed the posting of abusive tweets , including rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard , British feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and the British MP Stella Creasy . Three men were arrested under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in connection with the incidents . In August 2014 , Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and \" authorized individuals \" . The move followed controversy over the sharing of images on Twitter showing the killing of American journalist James Foley . In December 2014 Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies ; a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper , a target of GamerGate , also received notable coverage . In February 2015 , in an internal Twitter memo , CEO Dick Costolo said he was ' frankly ashamed ' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse , and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result . Per an updated terms of service and privacy policy , Twitter users outside of the United States are legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter Inc . , effective May 18 , 2015 . The change make these users subject to Irish and European data protection laws . = = = Open source = = = Twitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service . A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used , from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala . Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores , the distributed graph database FlockDB , the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients , the TwUI user interface framework for iOS , and the Bower client-side package manager . The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the most popular repository on GitHub . = = = Innovators patent agreement = = = On April 17 , 2012 , Twitter announced it would implement an \" Innovators Patent Agreement \" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes . The agreement went into effect in 2012 . = = = URL shortener = = = t.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter . It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use . All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper . Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites , and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets . Having used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly , Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for private messages in March 2010 using the twt.tl domain , before it purchased the t.co domain . The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @ TwitterAPI , @ rsarver and @ raffi . On September 2 , 2010 , an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll-out of the service to users . On June 7 , 2011 , Twitter announced that it was rolling out the feature . = = = Integrated photo-sharing service = = = On June 1 , 2011 , Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com. Users now also have the ability to add pictures to Twitter 's search by adding hashtags to the tweet . Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic . = = = Twitterbots = = = A Twitterbot is a computer program that automatically posts on Twitter , they are programmed to tweet , retweet , and follow other accounts . According to a recent report , there were 20 million , fewer than 5 % , of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013 . These fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers , while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase . Twitter 's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots ' existence within the social networking site . = = Society = = = = = Issues and controversies = = = Twitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios . For example , it has been used to organize protests , sometimes referred to as \" Twitter Revolutions \" , which include the 2011 Egyptian revolution , 2010 \u2013 2011 Tunisian protests , 2009 \u2013 2010 Iranian election protests , and 2009 Moldova civil unrest . The systematic literature review by Buettner & Buettner analyzed the role of Twitter during a wide range of revolutions and other social movements ( 2007 WikiLeaks , 2009 Moldova , 2009 Austria student protest , 2009 Israel-Gaza , 2009 Iran green revolution , 2009 Toronto G20 , 2010 Venezuela , 2010 Germany Stuttgart21 , 2011 Egypt , 2011 England , 2011 US Occupy movement , 2011 Spain Indignados , 2011 Greece Aganaktismenoi movements , 2011 Italy , 2011 Wisconsin labor protests , 2012 Israel Hamas , 2013 Brazil Vinegar , 2013 Turkey ) . The governments of Iran and Egypt blocked the service in retaliation . The Hill on February 28 , 2011 described Twitter and other social media as a \" strategic weapon ... which have the apparent ability to re-align the social order in real time , with little or no advanced [ sic ] warning \" . During the Arab Spring in early 2011 , the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased . A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0.26 % of the Egyptian population , 0.1 % of the Tunisian population and 0.04 % of the Syrian population are active on Twitter . The service is also used as a form of civil disobedience : in 2010 , users expressed outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by making obvious jokes about terrorism ; and in the British privacy injunction debate in the same country a year later , where several celebrities who had taken out anonymised injunctions , most notably the Manchester United player Ryan Giggs , were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored . Another , more real time and practical use for Twitter exists as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news . It was neither intended nor designed for high performance communication , but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication certainly was not lost on the originators , who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the San Francisco company used it to communicate during earthquakes . The Boston Police tweeted news of the arrest of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev . Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter 's ability to track epidemics and how they spread . In addition , Twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires . Twitter has been used by Somalia 's al-Shabaab rebels , who had their accounts suspended after they used the site to claim responsibility for an attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi in September 2013 . The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) has also used the service : in January 2016 , Twitter was sued by the widow of a U.S. man killed in the Amman shooting attack , claiming that allowing ISIL to use the platform constituted the provision of material support of a terrorist organization , which is illegal under U.S. federal law . Twitter disputed the claim , stating that \" violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and , like other social networks , our rules make that clear . \" The Electronic Frontier Foundation believed that Twitter could be protected under Section 230 safe harbors , which dictate that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by others . On May 31 , 2016 , Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics , sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech . Following public outcry , Twitter restored the accounts the next day without answering why the accounts were suspended . The same day , Twitter , along with Facebook , Google , and Microsoft , jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review \" [ the ] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech \" posted on their services within 24 hours . = = = Censorship and Twitter = = = Twitter is banned completely in Iran , China and North Korea , and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt , Iraq , Turkey and Venezuela on different bases . = = = = Twitter Trust & Safety Council = = = = On February 9 , 2016 , Twitter announced the creation of the \" Twitter Trust & Safety Council . \" The stated aim of this council is \" ... to ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter . \" The 50 \" Inaugural Members \" of the council that were named in the announcement consisted almost entirely of persons or progressive organizations who have advocated the censorship of hate speech on the internet . = = = = Trending topics = = = = After claims in the media that the hashtags # wikileaks and # occupywallstreet were being censored because they did not show up on the site 's list of trending topics , Twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities . In 2016 , at the same time as Twitter executives paid to attend a political fundraiser by Hillary Clinton , the Twitter platform banned a pro-Bernie Sanders account that had started a hashtag critical of Clinton 's fundraising from wealthy donors . = = = Impact = = = = = = = Instant , short , and frequent communication = = = = In May 2008 , The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter \" elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters . Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends . But some users are starting to feel ' too ' connected , as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours , higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they 're having for dinner . \" The following year , John C. Dvorak described Twitter as \" the new CB radio \" . = = = = Education = = = = Twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities . It has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions , especially in large-lecture courses . Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty , promotes informal learning , allows shy students a forum for increased participation , increases student engagement , and improves overall course grades . = = = = Public figures = = = = Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for \" literate communication \" is \" about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad \" . In September 2008 , the journalist Clive Thompson mused in a The New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into \" a new , supermetabolic extreme \u2014 the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world \" . One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity related twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980 , when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round the clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller , even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis . Conversely , Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter 's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints , and Jonathan Zittrain , professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School , said that \" the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful \" . The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called \" Some Contemporary Characters , \" composed entirely of tweets . In 2009 , Nielsen Online reported that Twitter has a user retention rate of forty percent . Many people stop using the service after a month , therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users . In 2009 , Twitter won the \" Breakout of the Year \" Webby Award . During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio 's Weekend Edition , the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements . In response , Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories . On November 29 , 2009 Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor , declaring it \" a new form of social interaction \" . Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100 ; to determine the influence of people , it used a formula based on famous social networking sites , Twitter and Facebook . The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher . The U.S. government , seeing social media 's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts , covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called ZunZuneo as part of a long-term strategy to \" stir unrest \" . The service was active from 2010 to 2012 . During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony , in which he appeared at the London Olympic Stadium in person , Sir Tim Berners-Lee , the founder of the World Wide Web , tweeted \" This is for everyone \" , which was instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience . = = = = = World leaders = = = = = World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter 's rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy , the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens . US Ambassador to Russia , Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy . He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011 , posting in English and Russian . On October 24 , 2014 , Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum 's Information Age exhibition . A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts . The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers , with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers . According to an analysis of accounts , the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350,000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers . However , only 30 of these do their own tweeting , more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts . = = = = Religion = = = = More than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals manage active Twitter accounts , nine of whom were cardinal electors for the 2013 Papal conclave . Pope Benedict XVI was the first Pope to have a Twitter account ; it was set up in 2012 . As of April 2016 , his successor , Pope Francis , has 9.06 million followers of his Twitter account ( @ Pontifex ) . In 2014 astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson caused a controversy among conservative Christians with a Christmas tweet celebrating the birth of Isaac Newton . = = = = Twitterbot effect = = = = Twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture , products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication . The New York Times states , \" They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing , making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs . \" The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing , all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot . The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal . Looking at the Computers as Social Actors ( CASA ) paradigm , the journal notes , \" people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media , treating them as if they were real people or real places . \" The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere . While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction , the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm . Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular , push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation , spam and / or slander . In addition to content generating bots , users can purchase followers , favorites , retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a users image through accumulation of followers . With more followers , users ' profiles gain more attention , thus increasing their popularity . Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability . With Twitterbots , users are able to create the illusion of \" buzz \" on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms . The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people , some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real . This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter . The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities , politicians , musicians , public figures , and companies alike . According to The New York Times , bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections , influence the stock market , public appeal , and attack governments . = = = GCHQ = = = According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July 2014 , the United Kingdom 's GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for \" automated posting of Twitter updates \" , and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for \" Twitter monitoring and profile collection \" . = = Television = = Twitter is also increasingly used for making TV more interactive and social . This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen , \" virtual watercooler \" or social television \u2014 the practice has been called \" chatterboxing \" . Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events , such as the Oscars , the Super Bowl and the MTV Video Music Awards ; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows . Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising . In December 2012 , Twitter and Nielsen entered a multi-year agreement to produce social TV ratings , which are expected to be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating . Advertising Age said Twitter had become the new TV Guide . Then in February 2013 , Twitter acquired Bluefin Labs for an estimated US $ 50 million to $ 100 million , which was the company 's largest acquisition as of 2013 . Founded in 2008 at the MIT Media Lab , Bluefin is a data miner whose analysis tells which brands ( e.g. , TV shows and companies ) are chatted about the most in social media . MIT Technology Review said that Bluefin gives Twitter part of the US $ 72 billion television advertising market . In April 2013 , the Associated Press ' Twitter account was briefly hacked into , sending out a message that US president Barack Obama had been injured in an attack on the White House . Stocks lost $ 134 billion in value almost instantly , before recovering in value when it was discovered the report was false . In May 2013 , it launched Twitter Amplify \u2014 an advertising product for media and consumer brands . With Amplify , Twitter runs video highlights from major live broadcasts , with advertisers ' names and messages playing before the clip . Then in October 2013 , Comcast announced a partnership with NBCUniversal and Twitter , to allow users to tune into live streaming from their set-top box , smartphone or tablet by tapping a ' See It ' button embedded in selected tweets . In an attempt to compete with Twitter 's leadership in TV , Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation around TV including hashtags , verified profiles and embeddable posts . It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets , enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame , with a demographic breakdown of the age , gender , and location of these people . In January 2014 , Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time . Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV . However , Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later . These acquisitions , as well as a partnership with research company Kantar ( which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013 ) strengthened Twitter 's dominance of the \" second screen \" \u2013 TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media . With the additional analytic tools , Twitter was able to improve the firm 's offering to advertisers , allowing them to , for instance , only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme . By February 2014 , all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program , bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in-tweet real-time video clips . In March 2014 , ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to sign up to Twitter Amplify and Twitter introduced one-tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience . In June 2014 , Twitter acquired its Twitter Amplify partner in the U.S. , SnappyTV , as part of its ongoing efforts to be the leader in social television . The company was helping broadcasters and rights holders to share video content both organically across social and via Twitter 's Amplify program . In Europe Twitter 's Amplify partner is London-based Grabyo , which has also struck numerous deals with broadcasters and rights holders to share video content across Facebook and Twitter . On July 11 , 2016 , Twitter announced a partnership with CBS News to live stream both the 2016 Republican National Convention , July 18-21 , and the 2016 Democratic National Convention , July 25-28 . = = Statistics = = = = = Most popular accounts = = = As of May 31 , 2016 , the Twitter accounts with the most followers were : Katy Perry : 89,071,169 Justin Bieber : 82,290,686 Taylor Swift : 77,874,177 Barack Obama : 75,241,599 YouTube : 62,319,173 Rihanna : 61,114,092 Ellen DeGeneres : 60,060,695 Lady Gaga : 59,757,672 Justin Timberlake : 55,406,690 Twitter : 55,064,486 = = = Oldest accounts = = = The oldest Twitter accounts are 14 accounts which became active on March 21 , 2006 , all belonging to Twitter employees at the time and including @ jack ( Jack Dorsey ) , @ biz ( Biz Stone ) , and @ noah ( Noah Glass ) . = = = Record tweets = = = With over 41 million tweets , the most discussed topic ever on Twitter was the \" # ALDubEBTamangPanahon \" of AlDub on October 24 , 2015 during the sold out special concert presentation of the Kalyeserye segment of the noontime show Eat Bulaga entitled Eat Bulaga : Sa Tamang Panahon held at the Philippine Arena , the world 's largest indoor arena located in Bulacan , Philippines . The said event was attended by over 55,000 fans . With over 35.6 million tweets , the most discussed sports game ever on Twitter was the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany on July 8 , 2014 . A selfie orchestrated by 86th Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres during the March 2 , 2014 broadcast is the most retweeted image ever . DeGeneres said she wanted to homage Meryl Streep 's record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her , and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them . The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes , and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour . By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times ; less than 24 hours later , it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times . As of 18 March 2014 , it has been retweeted over 3.4 million times . The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego , and Matt Groening with The Simpsons . It beat the previous record , 778,801 , which was held by Barack Obama , following his victory in the 2012 presidential election . According to Guinness World Records , the fastest pace to a million followers was set by actor Robert Downey Jr. in 23 hours and 22 minutes in April 2014 . This record was later broken by Caitlyn Jenner , who joined the site on June 1 , 2015 and amassed a million followers in just 4 hours and 3 minutes . The most tweeted moment in the history of Twitter was during the airing of Castle in the Sky on August 2 , 2013 , when fans tweeted the word \" balse \" at the exact time that it played in the movie . There was a global peak of 143,199 tweets in one second , beating the previous record of 33,388 .",

Each summer , IABC hosts World Conference , a three-day event with professional development seminars and activities , as well as talks by industry leaders . Decisions within the organization are made by a two-thirds vote of the executive board , which is elected by members . IABC members agree to follow a professional code of ethics , which encourages members to do what is legal , ethical and in good taste . = = History = = IABC 's predecessor was the American Association of Industrial Editors ( AAIE ) , which was founded in 1938 . AAIE became a member of the International Council of Industrial Editors ( ICIE ) in 1941 . It withdrew from ICIE in 1946 over policy differences , but formed IABC when it merged again in 1970 . In IABC 's first year of operation , the association had 2,280 members and was focused on internal communications . IABC 's research showed its members were moving into positions with broader public relations responsibilities and the association expanded its scope . In 1974 it merged with Corporate Communicators Canada . In 1982 the association formed the IABC Research Foundation , which funded a study of 323 organizations in the 1980s to determine what made some public relations teams more effective than others . The study found that executive involvement in communications was the best predictor of effectiveness . The Research Foundation also looked into the status and pay of women in the public relations field , in a pioneering study called The Velvet Ghetto . IABC had financial troubles in 2000 after losing $ 1 million in an e-business initiative called TalkingBusinessNow . In 2001 a grass-roots initiative was started within IABC 's membership that eventually developed into the Gift of Communication program , whereby members donated their professional services to local charities . Membership grew 7 \u2013 9 percent each year in the 2000s due to an increasing number of practitioners in the field of internal communications . IABC hosted its first annual world conference in 2005 and grew to more than 16,000 members by 2008 . That same year , IABC accredited Chinese citizens for the first time in the Accredited Business Communicator ( ABC ) program . In 2009 the IABC Research Foundation conducted a survey that found 79 percent of respondents frequently use social media to communicate with employees . It also co-authored a study the following year that found email and intranet were the most common internal communications tools among respondents . For 40 years , the association offered an accreditation program called Accreditation for Business Communications ( ABC ) . By the time the program ended in 2013 , a total of 1,003 people had earned ABC status . Though the program stopped accepting new applicants in September 2012 , ABCs will be recognized as long as they maintain their membership in IABC . A new professional certification program to replace accreditation with a more affordable , computer-based process was proposed in January 2013 . The goal is to set an international standard for all communications professionals that will be recognized by an organization such as ISO17024 . The autonomous international group to oversee the creation of the new certification program \u2014 the Global Communication Certification Council \u2014 was appointed in February 2014 . = = Organization = = IABC offers professional , corporate , student and retired memberships . Representatives from different chapters and regions , as well as professional members , vote at the Annual General Meeting to elect members to the international executive board . The board can change dues , establish new chapters , create workgroups and remove members with a two-thirds vote . IABC also has various committees focused on ethics , research , finance , auditing and others . All positions within IABC are filled by volunteers . IABC has more than 100 chapters worldwide in North America , Africa , Asia Pacific , and Europe . = = Services = = IABC hosts networking events and mentoring programs to help recent graduates connect with working public relations , marketing and corporate communications professionals . Most professional members join IABC to further their career advancement , professional development and to grow their professional network . IABC is no longer accepting new applicants for its Accredited Business Communicator ( ABC ) program , but a new certification program has been initiated that would involve computerized testing and renewals every three years . The new certification program will have two levels ; the first level being developed is for Communications Generalists . IABC publishes a code of ethics , which has three principles : that professional communications be legal , ethical and in good taste . It says members should be sensitive to cultural values , as well as be truthful , accurate and respectful . Before 1995 , the code said \" Communicators should encourage frequent communication and messages that are honest in their content , candid , accurate and appropriate to the needs of the organization and its audiences . \" IABC hosts the Gold Quill Awards , which are bestowed at three levels : Gold , Silver and Bronze . The Gold Quill is an international awards program that 's open to both members and non- members . The Silver and Bronze Quills are conducted at a local chapter level and open to both members and non-members . The awards are bestowed for \" creatively and effectively communicating \" in measurable ways that contribute to the local community . In 2014 the Gold Quill has four divisions and more than 40 categories . Both the Gold Quill and some of the regional chapters offer special awards for college students . = = Publishing = = Brent D.

                    "text": "Watson ( computer ) = Watson is a question answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language , developed in IBM 's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci . Watson was named after IBM 's first CEO and industrialist Thomas J. Watson . The computer system was specifically developed to answer questions on the quiz show Jeopardy ! . In 2011 , Watson competed on Jeopardy ! against former winners Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings . Watson received the first place prize of $ 1 million . Watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage including the full text of Wikipedia , but was not connected to the Internet during the game . For each clue , Watson 's three most probable responses were displayed on the television screen . Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the game 's signaling device , but had trouble in a few categories , notably those having short clues containing only a few words . In February 2013 , IBM announced that Watson software system 's first commercial application would be for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in conjunction with health insurance company WellPoint . IBM Watson 's former business chief Manoj Saxena says that 90 % of nurses in the field who use Watson now follow its guidance . = = Description = = Watson is a question answering ( QA ) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing , information retrieval , knowledge representation , automated reasoning , and machine learning technologies to the field of open domain question answering . The key difference between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns a list of documents , ranked in order of relevance to the query ( often based on popularity and page ranking ) , while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language , seeks to understand it in much greater detail , and returns a precise answer to the question . According to IBM , \" more than 100 different techniques are used to analyze natural language , identify sources , find and generate hypotheses , find and score evidence , and merge and rank hypotheses . \" = = = Software = = = Watson uses IBM 's DeepQA software and the Apache UIMA ( Unstructured Information Management Architecture ) framework . The system was written in various languages , including Java , C + + , and Prolog , and runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 operating system using Apache Hadoop framework to provide distributed computing . = = = Hardware = = = The system is workload-optimized , integrating massively parallel POWER7 processors and built on IBM 's DeepQA technology , which it uses to generate hypotheses , gather massive evidence , and analyze data . Watson employs a cluster of ninety IBM Power 750 servers , each of which uses a 3.5 GHz POWER7 eight core processor , with four threads per core . In total , the system has 2,880 POWER7 processor threads and 16 terabytes of RAM . According to John Rennie , Watson can process 500 gigabytes , the equivalent of a million books , per second . IBM 's master inventor and senior consultant Tony Pearson estimated Watson 's hardware cost at about three million dollars . Its Linpack performance stands at 80 TeraFLOPs , which is about half as fast as the cut-off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list . According to Rennie , all content was stored in Watson 's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions . = = = Data = = = The sources of information for Watson include encyclopedias , dictionaries , thesauri , newswire articles , and literary works . Watson also used databases , taxonomies , and ontologies . Specifically , DBPedia , WordNet , and Yago were used . The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents , including dictionaries , encyclopedias , and other reference material that it could use to build its knowledge . = = Operation = = Watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases . Watson 's main innovation was not in the creation of a new algorithm for this operation but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven language analysis algorithms simultaneously to find the correct answer . The more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely Watson is to be correct . Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions , it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense . = = = Comparison with human players = = = Watson 's basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses . This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human Jeopardy ! players . Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues . As a result , human players usually generate responses faster than Watson , especially to short clues . Watson 's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response . Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response , and is immune to human players ' psychological tactics , such as jumping between categories on every clue . In a sequence of 20 mock games of Jeopardy , human participants were able to use the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding . During that time , Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal . Part of the system used to win the Jeopardy ! contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the \" ready \" signal and then examined whether Watson 's confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer . Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times , Watson 's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated ( instead of reacted to ) the ready signal . After signaling , Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in Jeopardy ! ' s question format . Watson 's voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM text-to-speech program in 2004 . The Jeopardy ! staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz , which was critical in many rounds . The humans were notified by a light , which took them tenths of a second to perceive . Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds . The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light , but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson 's response time . Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal . = = History = = = = = Development = = = Since Deep Blue 's victory over Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997 , IBM had been on the hunt for a new challenge . In 2004 , IBM Research manager Charles Lickel , over dinner with coworkers , noticed that the restaurant they were in had fallen silent . He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus : Ken Jennings , who was then in the middle of his successful 74-game run on Jeopardy ! . Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions , mid-meal , to watch the phenomenon . Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM , Lickel passed the idea on , and in 2005 , IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up , pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy ! with an IBM system . Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess , eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer . In competitions managed by the United States government , Watson 's predecessor , a system named Piquant , was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35 % of clues and often required several minutes to respond . To compete successfully on Jeopardy ! , Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds , and at that time , the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve . In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci , the senior manager of IBM 's Semantic Analysis and Integration department , Watson was given 500 clues from past Jeopardy ! programs . While the best real-life competitors buzzed in half the time and responded correctly to as many as 95 % of clues , Watson 's first pass could get only about 15 % correct . During 2007 , the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems . By 2008 , the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with Jeopardy ! champions . By February 2010 , Watson could beat human Jeopardy ! contestants on a regular basis . Although the system is primarily an IBM effort , Watson 's development involved faculty and graduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Carnegie Mellon University , University of Massachusetts Amherst , the University of Southern California 's Information Sciences Institute , the University of Texas at Austin , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and the University of Trento , as well as students from New York Medical College . = = = Jeopardy ! = = = = = = = Preparation = = = = In 2008 , IBM representatives communicated with Jeopardy ! executive producer Harry Friedman about the possibility of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter , two of the most successful contestants on the show , and the program 's producers agreed . Watson 's differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and Jeopardy ! staff during the planning of the competition . IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the show 's writers would exploit Watson 's cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues , thereby turning the game into a Turing test . To alleviate that claim , a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast . Jeopardy ! staff also showed concerns over Watson 's reaction time on the buzzer . Originally Watson signaled electronically , but show staff requested that it press a button physically , as the human contestants would . Even with a robotic \" finger \" pressing the buzzer , Watson remained faster than its human competitors . Ken Jennings noted , \" If you 're trying to win on the show , the buzzer is all , \" and that Watson \" can knock out a microsecond-precise buzz every single time with little or no variation . Human reflexes can 't compete with computer circuits in this regard . \" Stephen Baker , a journalist who recorded Watson 's development in his book \" Final Jeopardy \" , reported that the conflict between IBM and Jeopardy ! became so serious in May 2010 that the competition was almost canceled . As part of the preparation , IBM constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model the one used on Jeopardy ! . Human players , including former Jeopardy ! contestants , also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of The Onion playing host . About 100 test matches were conducted with Watson winning 65 % of the games . To provide a physical presence in the televised games , Watson was represented by an \" avatar \" of a globe , inspired by the IBM \" smarter planet \" symbol . Jennings described the computer 's avatar as a \" glowing blue ball criss-crossed by ' threads ' of thought \u2014 42 threads , to be precise , \" and stated that the number of thought threads in the avatar was an in-joke referencing the significance of the number 42 in Douglas Adams ' Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . Joshua Davis , the artist who designed the avatar for the project , explained to Stephen Baker that there are 36 triggerable states that Watson was able to use throughout the game to show its confidence in responding to a clue correctly ; he had hoped to be able to find forty-two , to add another level to the Hitchhiker 's Guide reference , but he was unable to pinpoint enough game states . A practice match was recorded on January 13 , 2011 , and the official matches were recorded on January 14 , 2011 . All participants maintained secrecy about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February . = = = = Practice match = = = = In a practice match before the press on January 13 , 2011 , Watson won a 15-question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a score of $ 4,400 to Jennings 's $ 3,400 and Rutter 's $ 1,200 , though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final $ 1,000 question . None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue . = = = = First match = = = = The first round was broadcast February 14 , 2011 , and the second round , on February 15 , 2011 . The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter . Watson , represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice , responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category , a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible . Watson 's guess at the Daily Double location was correct . At the end of the first round , Watson was tied with Rutter at $ 5,000 ; Jennings had $ 2,000 . Watson 's performance was characterized by some quirks . In one instance , Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings . ( Jennings said \" What are the ' 20s ? \" in reference to the 1920s . Then Watson said \" What is 1920s ? \" ) Because Watson could not recognize other contestants ' responses , it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response . In another instance , Watson was initially given credit for a response of \" What is leg ? \" after Jennings incorrectly responded \" What is : he only had one hand ? \" to a clue about George Eyser ( The correct response was , \" What is : he 's missing a leg ? \" ) . Because Watson , unlike a human , could not have been responding to Jennings 's mistake , it was decided that this response was incorrect . The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek 's original acceptance of Watson 's response . Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles , with one bet at $ 6,435 and another at $ 1,246 . Gerald Tesauro , one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson , explained that Watson 's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator . Watson took a commanding lead in Double Jeopardy ! , correctly responding to both Daily Doubles . Watson responded to the second Daily Double correctly with a 32 % confidence score . Although it wagered only $ 947 on the clue , Watson was the only contestant to miss the Final Jeopardy ! response in the category U.S. CITIES ( \" Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero ; its second largest , for a World War II battle \" ) . Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago , but Watson 's response was \" What is Toronto ? ? ? ? ? \" Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city : categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired , the phrase \" U.S. city \" didn 't appear in the question , there are cities named Toronto in the U.S. , and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team . Dr. Chris Welty , who also worked on Watson , suggested that it may not have been able to correctly parse the second part of the clue , \" its second largest , for a World War II battle \" ( which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon , and required context to understand that it was referring to a second-largest airport ) . Eric Nyberg , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team , stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable . Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy ! questions , Watson 's second choice was Chicago . Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson 's confidence threshold , at 14 % and 11 % respectively . ( This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson 's response . ) The game ended with Jennings with $ 4,800 , Rutter with $ 10,400 , and Watson with $ 35,734 . = = = = Second match = = = = During the introduction , Trebek ( a Canadian native ) joked that he had learned Toronto was a U.S. city , and Watson 's error in the first match prompted an IBM engineer to wear a Toronto Blue Jays jacket to the recording of the second match . In the first round , Jennings was finally able to choose a Daily Double clue , while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue incorrectly for the first time in the Double Jeopardy ! Round . After the first round , Watson placed second for the first time in the competition after Rutter and Jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before Watson could respond . Nonetheless , the final result ended with a victory for Watson with a score of $ 77,147 , besting Jennings who scored $ 24,000 and Rutter who scored $ 21,600 . = = = = Final outcome = = = = The prizes for the competition were $ 1 million for first place ( Watson ) , $ 300,000 for second place ( Jennings ) , and $ 200,000 for third place ( Rutter ) . As promised , IBM donated 100 % of Watson 's winnings to charity , with 50 % of those winnings going to World Vision and 50 % going to World Community Grid . Similarly , Jennings and Rutter donated 50 % of their winnings to their respective charities . In acknowledgment of IBM and Watson 's achievements , Jennings made an additional remark in his Final Jeopardy ! response : \" I for one welcome our new computer overlords \" , echoing a similar memetic reference to the episode \" Deep Space Homer \" on The Simpsons , in which TV news presenter Kent Brockman speaks of welcoming \" our new insect overlords \" . Jennings later wrote an article for Slate , in which he stated \" IBM has bragged to the media that Watson 's question-answering skills are good for more than annoying Alex Trebek . The company sees a future in which fields like medical diagnosis , business analytics , and tech support are automated by question-answering software like Watson . Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assembly-line robots , Brad and I were the first knowledge-industry workers put out of work by the new generation of ' thinking ' machines . ' Quiz show contestant ' may be the first job made redundant by Watson , but I 'm sure it won 't be the last . \" = = = = Philosophy = = = = Philosopher John Searle argues that Watson \u2014 despite impressive capabilities \u2014 cannot actually think . Drawing on his Chinese room thought experiment , Searle claims that Watson , like other computational machines , is capable only of manipulating symbols , but has no ability to understand the meaning of those symbols ; however , Searle 's experiment has its detractors . = = = = Match against members of the United States Congress = = = = On February 28 , 2011 , Watson played an untelevised exhibition match of Jeopardy ! against members of the United States House of Representatives . In the first round , Rush D. Holt , Jr . ( D-NJ , a former Jeopardy ! contestant ) , who was challenging the computer with Bill Cassidy ( R-LA ) , led with Watson in second place . However , combining the scores between all matches , the final score was $ 40,300 for Watson and $ 30,000 for the congressional players combined . IBM 's Christopher Padilla said of the match , \" The technology behind Watson represents a major advancement in computing . In the data-intensive environment of government , this type of technology can help organizations make better decisions and improve how government helps its citizens . \" = = Current and future applications = = According to IBM , \" The goal is to have computers start to interact in natural human terms across a range of applications and processes , understanding the questions that humans ask and providing answers that humans can understand and justify . \" It has been suggested by Robert C. Weber , IBM 's general counsel , that Watson may be used for legal research . The company also intends to use Watson in other information-intensive fields , such as telecommunications , financial services , and government . Watson is based on commercially available IBM Power 750 servers that have been marketed since February 2010 . IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations , with a price in the millions of dollars , reflecting the $ 1 million needed to acquire a server that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson . IBM expects the price to decrease substantially within a decade as the technology improves . Commentator Rick Merritt said that \" there 's another really important reason why it is strategic for IBM to be seen very broadly by the American public as a company that can tackle tough computer problems . A big slice of [ IBM 's profit ] comes from selling to the U.S. government some of the biggest , most expensive systems in the world . \" In 2013 , it was reported that three companies were working with IBM to create apps embedded with Watson technology . Fluid is developing an app for retailers , one called \" The North Face \" , which is designed to provide advice to online shoppers . Welltok is developing an app designed to give people advice on ways to engage in activities to improve their health . MD Buyline is developing an app for the purpose of advising medical institutions on equipment procurement decisions . In November , 2013 , IBM announced it would make Watson 's API available to software application providers , enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded with Watson 's capabilities . To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform , IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms , which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem . Thus far , roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM , with interest in creating applications that could use the Watson platform . On January 30 , 2013 , it was announced that Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute would receive a successor version of Watson , which would be housed at the Institute 's technology park and be available to researchers and students . By summer 2013 , Rensselaer had become the first university to receive a Watson computer . On February 6 , 2014 , it was reported that IBM plans to invest $ 100 million in a 10-year initiative to use Watson and other IBM technologies to help countries in Africa address development problems , beginning with healthcare and education . On June 3 , 2014 , three new Watson Ecosystem partners were chosen from more than 400 business concepts submitted by teams spanning 18 industries from 43 countries . \" These bright and enterprising organizations have discovered innovative ways to apply Watson that can deliver demonstrable business benefits , \" said Steve Gold , vice president , IBM Watson Group . The winners were Majestyk Apps with their adaptive educational platform , FANG ( Friendly Anthropomorphic Networked Genome ) ; Red Ant with their retail sales trainer ; and GenieMD with their medical recommendation service . On July 9 , 2014 , Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories announced plans to integrate Watson to improve their customer experience platform , citing the sheer volume of customer data to analyze is staggering . Watson has been integrated with databases including Bon App\u00e9tit magazine to perform a recipe generating platform . Watson is being used by Decibel , a music discovery startup , in its app MusicGeek which uses the supercomputer to provide music recommendations to its users . The use of the artificial intelligence of Watson has also been found in hospitality industry . GoMoment uses Watson for its Rev1 app , which gives hotel staff a way to quickly respond to questions from guests . Arria NLG has built an app that helps energy companies stay within regulatory guidelines , making it easier for managers to make sense of thousands of pages of legal and technical jargon . OmniEarth , Inc. uses Watson computer vision services to analyze satellite and aerial imagery , along with other municipal data , to infer water usage on a property-by-property basis , helping water districts in drought-stricken California improve water conservation efforts . = = = Healthcare = = = In healthcare , Watson 's natural language , hypothesis generation , and evidence-based learning capabilities allow it to function as a clinical decision support system for use by medical professionals . To aid physicians in the treatment of their patients , once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors , Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information ; then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patient 's medical and hereditary history ; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses ; and finally provides a list of individualized , confidence-scored recommendations . The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines , electronic medical record data , notes from physicians and nurses , research materials , clinical studies , journal articles , and patient information . Despite being developed and marketed as a \" diagnosis and treatment advisor , \" Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process , only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed . In February 2011 , it was announced that IBM would be partnering with Nuance Communications for a research project to develop a commercial product during the next 18 to 24 months , designed to exploit Watson 's clinical decision support capabilities . Physicians at Columbia University would help to identify critical issues in the practice of medicine where the system 's technology may be able to contribute , and physicians at the University of Maryland would work to identify the best way that a technology like Watson could interact with medical practitioners to provide the maximum assistance . In September 2011 , IBM and WellPoint , a major American healthcare provider , announced a partnership to utilize Watson 's data crunching capability to help suggest treatment options to physicians . Then , in February 2013 , IBM and WellPoint gave Watson its first commercial application , for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan \u2013 Kettering Cancer Center . IBM announced a partnership with Cleveland Clinic in October 2012 . The company has sent Watson to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University , where it will increase its health expertise and assist medical professionals in treating patients . The medical facility will utilize Watson 's ability to store and process large quantities of information to help speed up and increase the accuracy of the treatment process . \" Cleveland Clinic 's collaboration with IBM is exciting because it offers us the opportunity to teach Watson to ' think ' in ways that have the potential to make it a powerful tool in medicine , \" said C. Martin Harris , MD , chief information officer of Cleveland Clinic . On February 8 , 2013 , IBM announced that oncologists at the Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Westmed Medical Group in New York have started to test the Watson supercomputer system in an effort to recommend treatment for lung cancer . = = = IBM Watson Group = = = On January 9 , 2014 IBM announced it was creating a business unit around Watson , led by senior vice president Michael Rhodin . IBM Watson Group will have headquarters in New York 's Silicon Alley and will employ 2,000 people . IBM has invested $ 1 billion to get the division going . Watson Group will develop three new cloud-delivered services : Watson Discovery Advisor , Watson Engagement Advisor , and Watson Explorer . Watson Discovery Advisor will focus on research and development projects in pharmaceutical industry , publishing and biotechnology , Watson Engagement Advisor will focus on self-service applications using insights on the basis of natural language questions posed by business users , and Watson Explorer will focus on helping enterprise users uncover and share data-driven insights based on federated search more easily . The company is also launching a $ 100 million venture fund to spur application development for \" cognitive \" applications . According to IBM , the cloud-delivered enterprise-ready Watson has seen its speed increase 24 times over \u2014 a 2,300 percent improvement in performance , and its physical size shrank by 90 percent \u2014 from the size of a master bedroom to three stacked pizza boxes .

                    "text": "Comverse Technology = Comverse Technology , Inc . , originally founded in Israel , was a technology company located in Woodbury , New York in the United States , that developed and marketed telecommunications software . The company focused on providing value-added services to telecommunication service providers , in particular to mobile network operators . Comverse Technology had several wholly or partly owned subsidiaries . The name \" Comverse \" is a fusion of the words \" communication \" and \" versatility \" . Founded in 1982 , the company went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1986 . Led by co-founder and CEO Jacob \" Kobi \" Alexander , the company originally specialized in centralized hardware / software systems for voice and fax messaging and sold them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises . Much of its funding came from Israeli government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi-tech firms . By the mid-1990s , one of its most successful products allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from intercepted communications . Starting in the late 1990s , Comverse 's voice messaging software became its main product and the company grew rapidly with the surge in mobile phone use , passing the $ 1 billion mark in revenues . It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular short message service center ( SMSC ) product . While headquartered in the US , most of the company 's research and development was done in Israel ; Comverse became one of the more visible success stories in Israel 's hi-tech industry . It was one of Israel 's largest employers of software engineers , was closely followed in the nation 's business press , and was the first Israeli-associated company to join the S & P 500 index . In 2006 , Comverse was involved in an options backdating scandal . Alexander and two other top executives were charged in the US with multiple counts of conspiracy , fraud , money laundering and making false filings . Alexander fled the country to Namibia where he engaged in a prolonged fight against extradition . The scandal proved difficult for Comverse Technology to recover from ; the company was delisted from Nasdaq , removed from the S & P 500 , and spent the next several years consumed by the costly need to restate its financial reports for several years . Additionally affected by the financial crisis of 2008 and on and changes in the mobile phone market , the company underwent several rounds of large-scale layoffs and sold off parts of its business . By 2011 the company began a turnaround . During 2012 and 2013 , Comverse Technology divested itself of all its holdings and ceased to exist ; the two independent companies that carry on its most well-known product lines are Xura and Verint Systems . = = Subsidiaries = = Comverse Technology had multiple subsidiaries : Comverse , also known as Comverse Network Systems or Comverse CNS , is a provider of software and systems enabling value-added services for voice , messaging , mobile Internet and mobile advertising ; converged billing and active customer management ; and IP communications . Comverse 's solutions support flexible deployment models , including in-network , hosted and managed services , and can run on circuit-switched , IP , IMS , and converged network environments . Comverse 's customer base spans more than 130 countries and covers over 500 communication service providers serving more than two billion subscribers . It typically provided some 70 percent of Comverse Technology 's overall revenue . Comverse has 100 local offices in 40 countries , with its corporate headquarters located in Wakefield , Massachusetts , in the US . Verint Systems ( which , from 1999 to 2002 , was known as Comverse Infosys ) is a provider of solutions for analysis of intercepted communications , digital video-focused security and surveillance , and analytics and business intelligence for the enterprise . Their products are aimed to enable government and enterprises to make sense of the vast information they collect to meet performance and security goals . Verint solutions are used by more than 10,000 organizations in 150 countries . Verint is headquartered in Melville , New York , with offices worldwide and 2500 employees around the globe . By 2011 , Verint was 52 percent owned by Comverse Technology . Ulticom provides signaling solutions for wireless , wireline , and Internet communications . Ulticom 's products are used by telecommunication equipment and service providers worldwide to deploy mobility , location , payment , switching , and messaging services . Ulticom is headquartered in Mount Laurel , New Jersey , with additional offices in the United States , Europe , and Asia . Comverse acquired Ulticom in 1996 and sold it in 2010 . Startel sells integrated voice , data and networking solutions for use in call centers worldwide . It was originally an independent company that was acquired by Comverse Technology in 1992 . Starhome provides roaming services for mobile network operators . The Starhome portfolio includes international roaming services and core network solutions across various technologies , including intelligent networks and next-generation networks . It was fully owned by Comverse Technology until being sold to Fortissimo Capital in 2012 for $ 54 million . ComSor was a venture capital operation , created as a subsidiary in partnership with Soros Fund Management , that invested in start-up companies directly and was active in the late 1990s and early 2000s . = = History = = = = = Origins = = = The company 's origins date to 1982 ( or 1983 , sources differ ) , when three Israelis , aspiring investment banker Jacob \" Kobi \" Alexander of Shearson Loeb Rhoades , engineer Boaz Misholi , and Alexander brother-in-law and Columbia University computer science professor Yechiam Yemini , got together and founded an Israeli start-up company , Efrat Future Technologies Ltd . In a meeting in New York , Misholi had the idea of building a business around centralized hardware systems to support voice and fax messaging and selling them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises , who could then resell the voice and fax services to their customers . The three quickly returned to Israel and started the company , with the goal of securing Israeli government grants to fund the research and development work . The early years of the company were difficult ; in 1984 , they founded Comverse in the United States , which became the parent company of Efrat . The name \" Comverse \" was chosen as a fusion of the words \" communication \" and \" versatility \" . In 1986 Comverse went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market with a $ 20 million valuation ; the company used the money so gained as its final round of funding . The three founders had trouble working with each other , and Yemini divorced Alexander 's sister ; in 1987 , Alexander was left with sole control of the company after the other two pulled out . The company was a penny stock on the edge of collapse . = = = Early successes = = = Under his lead , Alexander was credited with turning around Comverse 's fortunes . In 1989 , the Ascom Group made a $ 6 million direct investment in the company . In 1990 , Comverse won a potentially $ 10 million contract , its largest yet , to deliver computers running voicemail and fax applications on West German cellular networks , beating out far larger corporations in the process . Deutsche Telekom became one of the company 's biggest early customers . By 1991 , the company had annual sales of $ 17 million and was selling a combined voice and fax mailbox system . Many of its early successes came from avoiding the huge telecommunications companies in the U.S. and instead focusing on selling to small- and medium-sized companies in the wireless market in Europe . The company also sought a variety of other markets , including developing countries such as Mexico and China for its Trilogue virtual telephone service . Gradually its product emphasis shifted more from hardware to software . While headquartered in the U.S. , nearly all its manufacturing was done in Israel , where it was able to substantially benefit from government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi-tech firms and industries by the Office of the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation . Many other Israeli companies were built by the same model , including another top software company , Mercury Interactive . During the 1990s , Comverse received at least 69 research and development grants from the OCS program . In 1993 , the company reported a 341 percent rise in profits on revenues in the $ 64 million range and was named a \" Company to Watch \" by Fortune magazine . However its stock plunged for a while in 1994 after a disappointing earnings report . By 1995 , Comverse was best known for its AudioDisk product , which was sold to overseas clients and allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from wiretaps . Half the company 's revenues at that point were from AudioDisk , and market analysts were recommending Comverse 's stock . = = = Growth with wireless = = = Comverse became a market leader in voice messaging software and boomed during the late 1990s with the surge in mobile phone use . Much of its market focus was on wireless operators and overseas companies , and it gained a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market . The growth coincided with SMS text messages becoming popular ; the first big application for SMS was as a notification mechanism to tell a wireless subscriber that voicemail were stored in a voicemail box . Comverse expanded this application into a full-blown short message service center ( SMSC ) , which receives , buffers , processes , and dispatches all SMS messages throughout a mobile network . Comverse branded and productised this as the Intelligent Short Message Service Center , or ISMSC . Typical of telecomm software , it ran on Unix-based platforms , such as UnixWare and later Linux . Comverse 's ISMSC found success as a lower-price solution for lower-traffic networks , where it competed with Logica 's Telepath solution . Other companies in the SMSC space included CMG and Openwave . ISMSC found considerable market penetration , exemplified by all six of Hong Kong 's wireless carriers using it . Comverse also became a participant in forming international wireless standards , such as in 2001 for the Speech Application Language Tags ( SALT ) markup language for XML to add voice capabilities to web-based applications . Additional industry standards groups in which Comverse has been active include the Open Mobile Alliance and TM Forum . In addition to growing organically , Comverse Technology began acquiring other companies in both Israel and the U.S. It acquired Dale , Gesek , McWilliams , & Sheridan , later known as DGM & S Telecom , in 1996 and renamed it Ulticom in 1999 . Comverse Technology acquired one of its key rivals , Boston Technology , for $ 843 million in stock in 1997 . The acquisition gave Comverse entree into the large U.S. telecommunications market and meant Comverse would be supplying voice messaging systems to 12 of the world 's top 20 carriers , and left it the third-largest supplier after Lucent and Northern Telecom . In 1999 , as it saw record earnings , Comverse formed two wholly owned subsidiaries , Comverse Network Systems and Comverse Infosys , representing the telecommunications services platforms and products and the digital monitoring and recording products , respectively . By 2000 , its revenues were $ 1.2 billion and it had global operations . It continued to aggressively acquire small companies to fill out its technologies , as exemplified by the purchase of Loronix , Gaya Software , and Exalink , all within a 30-day period in 2000 . The company 's stock price rose from around $ 10 in late 1998 to over $ 120 in early 2001 . The company was able to raise money several times on Nasdaq , including once for its Ulticom subsidiary and once ( at a valuation of $ 600 million ) shortly before the Dot-com bubble burst . Comverse was one of the most prominent and profitable success stories in Israel 's hi-tech industry , with both Haaretz and The Jerusalem Post referring to it as a flagship of that industry . As CEO , Alexander was sought out for meetings in Tel Aviv by world leaders such as Chinese President Jiang Zemin . He became known , as Bloomberg News later stated , as \" the wizard of Israel 's technology boom \" ; his oft-stated goal was for Comverse to do for Israel what Nokia had done for Finland . Comverse was one of the largest employers of software engineers in Israel and its stock was widely held among the Israeli investing public ; as a consequence , the successes and failures of Comverse were always followed closely in the country 's financial press . ( Amdocs and Mercury Interactive were two other prominent Israeli companies in the enterprise software sector that were also closely followed . ) The company was also quintessentially Israeli in how it was run , with Comverse CEO Ze 'ev Bregman in particular favoring a loose , relaxed system in which he knew all the employees and lines of management reporting were frequently bypassed . When Comverse Technology joined the S & P 500 index in 1999 , it was the first Israeli-associated company ever to do so . It set the same mark when it joined the NASDAQ-100 index . The early 2000s recession led to some struggles for Comverse Technology , with the global economic downturn leading to publicly announced profit warnings and a plunge in the stock price in July 2001 . Over 3,000 jobs were cut during the period as part of several restructuring efforts . The company still made some acquisitions , such as buying the instant messaging specialist Odigo for $ 20 million in 2002 , after having previously purchased a 12 percent stake in it in 2001 . The image of Comverse Technology as Israel 's blue-chip hi-tech stock suffered , and led to a slide in several other large Israeli technology firms . Comverse 's management was criticized by analysts for having issued over-optimistic forecasts , although many other Israeli firms in the industry did even worse or failed completely during this period . In addition , the European market for mobile voicemail management was already saturated by 2002 and the prepaid wireless market was in decline . In 2002 , Comverse Infosys changed its name to Verint , partly to separate its more thriving business from Comverse 's struggles , and staged a modestly successful IPO of a minority portion of its stock . By 2002 , Comverse Technology had more than 5,000 employees across nearly 40 countries ; due to the partial spinoffs and economic difficulties , revenues were down to $ 735 million . In December 2001 , a Fox News report raised the concern that wiretapping equipment provided by Comverse Infosys to the U.S. government for electronic eavesdropping may have been vulnerable , as these systems allegedly had a back door through which the wiretaps could be intercepted by unauthorized parties . Fox News reporter Carl Cameron said there was no reason to believe the Israeli government was implicated , but that \" a classified top-secret investigation is underway \" . A March 2002 story by Le Monde recapped the Fox report and concluded : \" Comverse is suspected of having introduced into its systems of the ' catch gates ' in order to ' intercept , record and store ' these wire-taps . This hardware would render the ' listener ' himself ' listened to ' . \" Fox News did not pursue the allegations , and in the years since , there have been no legal or commercial actions of any type taken against Comverse by the FBI or any other branch of the US Government related to data access and security issues . While no real evidence has been presented against Comverse or Verint , the allegations have become a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists . By 2005 , the company had $ 959 million in sales and employed over 5,000 people , of whom about half were located in Israel . That country held most of the research and development workers , many of whom occupied the company 's seven buildings on HaBarzel in the Ramat HaHayal district of Tel Aviv , while business and marketing operations were stationed in the company 's Woodbury , New York headquarters . = = = Options backdating and improper accounting = = = In 2006 , Comverse Technology was involved in an options backdating scandal . In May of that year , company founder and CEO Jacob Alexander stepped down from his position . Alexander , finance chief David Kreinberg , and former senior general counsel William Sorin ( both of whom had also stepped down ) were charged in July 2006 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York with multiple counts of conspiracy , fraud , money laundering and making false filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , all related to alleged options backdating or other actions related to stock options between 1998 and 2006 . The accusations against the three included the backdating of options to when Comverse stock had been trading at low prices , the use of fake names of option holders , and the creation of secret funds in which to hold the illicit gains . The SEC also filed civil charges against the three , for filing false annual and quarterly financial reports and proxy statements from 1991 to 2005 . By then , Alexander had already fled the country and was classified a wanted fugitive in August 2006 by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation . On 27 September 2006 , he was arrested in Namibia after hiding in Windhoek with his family , where he had bought a house at a country club . If extradited to the US and convicted , he faced 25 years in prison . He was released on bail and subsequently engaged in a long , and so far successful , battle to avoid extradition to the US ( in Namibia neither money laundering nor options backdating is a crime ) . Upon leaving the US he had transferred some $ 64 million to Israel , with most of that ending up in Namibia ; another $ 50 million was blocked by the US government , which overall sought the forfeiture of $ 138 million of Alexander 's assets . In April 2010 , Alexander won a victory in the Supreme Court of Namibia that allowed him to continue to live and work in that country until the extradition request is finally ruled upon . In November 2010 , Alexander agreed to pay the U.S. government $ 53.6 million to settle the SEC 's case against him , with those monies being targeted to settle assorted lawsuits against Comverse by shareholders . Of the other two executives , William Sorin pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was sentenced to a year in prison in 2007 . David Kreinberg cooperated with prosecutors , repaid $ 2.4 million to the SEC , and in 2011 was sentenced to the \" time served \" of the minimal period he had originally been in custody . While over a hundred companies were investigated or charged with options backdating , Comverse was one of the most known cases , and in the words of a pair of financial writers , \" Comverse was the poster child for stock option fraud . \" = = = Continuing difficulties = = = The scandal proved difficult for Comverse Technology to recover from . The three charged executives , who had stayed on as consultants , were fired without severance pay , and the company said it would pursue legal action against them . The board of directors was expanded from five to ten , with all of the new ones being Americans rather than Israelis . A new CEO , Andre Dahan , came on board in April 2007 but the ongoing management crisis prevented the company from engaging in new innovation or entering new business areas . Despite the 2006-2007 economic climate being one of growth , layoffs occurred in mid-2007 . Research analysts began speculating that the company might break up . Because of the accounting issues from the option backdating , Comverse Technology was unable to file full or timely financial reports with the SEC . Its stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market on 1 February 2007 , and removed from the S & P 500 and NASDAQ-100 at the same time . The stock then traded on the Pink Sheets . In 2009 , the SEC settled its case with Comverse Technology ; the company would not be subject to penalty fines over the backdating matter , but would accept a permanent injunction against itself regarding any future violations of law regarding publicly traded companies . A settlement in a similar case against Ulticom was also reached . The failure to file timely financial reports put the company at risk of having its stock registration revoked ; a process deciding this , involving the SEC and an Administrative Law Judge , is still active of 2011 . The financial crisis of 2008 and on caused further difficulties for Comverse Technology , with new layoffs occurring in October 2008 , March 2009 , and August 2009 . The company reportedly lost considerable money in 2009 , and the moves were typical of other hi-tech companies caught in the bad economic environment . Some of Comverse 's products were still viewed highly ; a Yankee Group survey ranked them first in the world in their type of billing services , and they were the worldwide market-share leaders in providing multimedia message service centers to wireless carriers . However , the rise in popularity of smartphones and of sending e-mail eroded the carrier market for some of Comverse 's products and services . By 2009 , the company 's upper management was now largely American rather than Israeli , Dahan was under internal criticism , and there were frequent clashes regarding company culture . By early 2010 , Comverse Technology was planning to finally release an annual report with full financial statements and return to being fully listed on Nasdaq , but still was anticipating more layoffs . One piece of positive news in July 2010 was an $ 80 million investment by well-known entrepreneur George Soros . However , the promised financial reports did not come , and an August 2010 public announcement that the company was short on cash and planning more layoffs and was subject to its stock being completely delisted caused a precipitous drop in the stock 's price , with the market valuation of the company falling below $ 1 billion . CEO Dahan said simply , \" These are challenging times . \" By August 2010 , analysts were stating that Comverse Technology might have to break up by selling off its subsidiaries and spin off Comverse 's own business units . Running low on cash , Comverse Technology engaged Goldman Sachs to explore such possibilities , with several large , well-known technology companies potentially interested in Comverse and some private equity firms possibly interested in Verint . The company had some 4,000 employees , and continued having about half of them employed in Israel and most of the rest in the US and France . The continuing financial reporting problems had cost the company some $ 500 million in accountants ' fees and related costs since 2006 and was the largest drain on its cash position . The fact that senior management awarded itself bonuses in a time of various rounds of layoffs left employees feeling outraged . Comverse 's restructuring also affected its 2006-acquired NetCentrex business unit in France , with layoffs or a shutdown possible . In October 2010 , Comverse Technology agreed to sell its two-thirds ownership of its Ulticom subsidiary to a U.S. private equity firm for $ 90 million ; the deal closed in December 2010 . The company also sold part of its holdings in Verint , netting $ 80 million , and sold for $ 27 million land in the hi-tech area of Ra 'anana , north of Tel Aviv , where it had been planning to build a new headquarters . In October 2010 , Comverse Technology finally published its restated financial reports for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 . ( The company 's fiscal year N runs from February of year N to January of N + 1 . ) They revealed that the company lost about $ 1 billion during that period . In February 2011 , the company announced that due to this effort , its report for fiscal 2009 would be delayed , and also that it was restructuring into four independent business units and focusing much of its emphasis on billing systems for mobile carriers . Layoffs also resumed , with more possibly in the offing . In March 2011 , revenues for fiscal 2009 were announced at $ 1.58 billion , down from $ 1.72 billion two years previously , with an overall loss of $ 273.3 million . Dahan stepped down as CEO . During his tenure , Comverse Technology stock fell 68 percent in price and 2,000 \u2013 2,500 employees were laid off ; he made more than $ 20 million during that time and gained payments of some $ 5 million upon his departure . Overall , his stint as leader of the company was not regarded positively by some in the Israeli business press . The new CEO was Charles Burdick , who had been non-executive chairman of the company . Burdick became the first American to head the company . In April 2011 , the company agreed to a $ 2.8 million settlement with the U.S. government over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that had taken place between 2003 and 2005 . Payments of $ 536,000 had been made to the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization in order to obtain purchase orders and had been inaccurately reported as sales commissions in Comverse 's accounting . = = = Hopes for recovery = = = During the first half of 2011 , analysts such as Oppenheimer & Co . , J.P. Morgan and Barclays said that with its accounting problems largely behind it , some restructuring done , and an improving cash balance and some revenue growth , Comverse Technology was well-positioned for ongoing operations or a possible sale . Zacks Investment Research predicted the company would again show a profit for fiscal year 2011 . Comverse itself had gained tens of millions in new business , was hiring again in modest numbers , and was at about 4,000 employees , including some on an outsourcing basis . In June 2011 , results for fiscal 2010 were announced , finally bringing the company current with its annual audited reporting . Revenues rose to $ 1.63 billion while the company 's net loss was halved to $ 132.3 million , and the cash position was now stated as being sufficient to meet foreseeable needs . Another positive sign for its recovery came when it was re-listed on NASDAQ in September 2011 . In April 2012 , results for fiscal 2011 were announced ; revenues remained flat at $ 1.59 billion while the company 's net loss decreased again , to $ 58.7 million . Results for fiscal year 2012 demonstrated a return to profitability , with a net income of $ 5.1 million . = = = Restructuring = = = In August 2012 , a series of transactions were announced that would end Comverse Technology as a functioning entity , by making Comverse Network Systems an independent company once again known simply as Comverse , allowing Verint Systems to buy back Comverse Technology 's majority stake , and selling off the other subsidiaries . Burdick said , \" [ The Verint ] agreement , along with the planned spin-off of [ Comverse Network Systems ] , will result in a tax efficient distribution to our shareholders and direct ownership in two independent , well-capitalized publicly-traded companies . \" Philippe Tartavull was named as the CEO of the newly independent Comverse . These transactions were completed on 4 February 2013 and represented the effective liquidation of the Comverse Technology holding entity . In September 2015 this new Comverse entity changed its name to Xura . = = Industry recognition = = Over the years , Comverse Technology won a number of awards within its industry , including : 2002 \u2013 Technology Marketing Corporation 's Product of the Year ( for Verint 's Ultra IntelliMiner ) 2004 \u2013 CMP Media 's Product of the Year ( for Verint 's Ultra Intelligent Recording ) 2004 \u2013 CDMA Development Group 's Innovative Solutions Award ( for Comverse 's Multimedia Messaging Service Center ) 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 \u2013 Frost and Sullivan 's Telecom BSS Vendor of the Year award ( for Comverse 's business support systems in the Asia Pacific region ) 2007 \u2013 International Engineering Consortium 's Best VoIP Product or Service Award ( for Comverse 's Converged IPCentrex solution ) 2007 \u2013 Technology Marketing Corporation 's IMS Leadership Award ( for Comverse 's Converged Messaging Solution ) 2007 \u2013 International Engineering Consortium 's InfoVision Awards for Best New Product ( for Comverse 's Converged Billing Suite ) 2007 \u2013 Technology Marketing Corporation 's Internet Telephony Excellence Award ( for Comverse 's MyCall Converged Communications product ) 2009 , 2010 \u2013 Technology Marketing Corporation 's Internet Telephony BSS / OSS Excellence Award ( for Comverse 's ONE Billing & Active Customer Management package ) 2010 \u2013 Virgo Publishing 's Excellence Award for Best Cost Management Implementation ( for Comverse 's Business Support System product )",

It provides Business Support Systems ( BSS ) software and services , primarily to the telecommunications industry . CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982 . It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $ 137 million . A contract with Tele-Communications Inc . ( TCI ) , the largest cable TV business at the time , was influential in the company 's growth from $ 80 million in revenue in 1994 to $ 171 million by 1997 . CSG went public in 1996 . A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $ 120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast , who acquired the TCI business . The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014 . CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s , mostly of companies that sold billing , customer service and operations software . = = Corporate history = = = = = Early history = = = CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group ( CSG ) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation . At the time First Data was operated by American Express , which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980 . CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company , which was formed in 1989 . The CSG group 's first large-scale billing statement processing center , which prints and mails bills to consumers , was established in Omaha in 1990 . Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications , where he met George Haddix . Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994 , which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $ 137 million . In November 1994 , Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International . CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994 , serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers . However , according to The International Directory of Company Histories , its profit margins were small and the company was \" still in need of a turnaround . \" Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent . Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company , which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months . The new CSG International grew quickly . The convergence of phone , internet , on-demand movies , and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers , which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG . Professional services and international clients , which were previously not a significant portion of revenues , grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s . = = = Post IPO = = = In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions , CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996 , which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price . CSG grew from $ 80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired , to $ 132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $ 171.7 million by 1997 . In the 1990s , Tele-Communications Inc . ( TCI ) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International . The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11 , 1997 made CSG the largest vendor in the industry and was the primary contributor to its growth in the ' 90s . By 2001 , the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG 's revenue . As part of the deal , CSG also acquired TCI 's internally developed software , SummiTrack , for $ 106 million . CSG 's services to TCI included billing , customer management and payment processing for TCI customers . In October 1997 , CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company , mc2 . At the end of 1997 , CSG co-founder George Haddix retired , and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place . In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government , which expanded roads and provided other incentives . In 2002 , CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $ 260 million . The deal was estimated to increase CSG 's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent . 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition . An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions . = = = Recent history = = = AT & T acquired TCI in 2000 , inheriting its agreement with CSG . AT & T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract 's terms to provide favorable rates . A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court . Before the dispute was resolved , AT & T Broadband was acquired by Comcast , who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor . In October 2002 , a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $ 120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices . The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term . CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004 and in 2008 . In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services . In March 2005 , co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64 . Ed Nafus , prior president of the broadband services division , took his place . Nafus was replaced by the current CEO , Peter Kalan , at the end of 2007 . = = Acquisitions = = = = Products , software and services = = CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data , analyzing that data , enterprise security , billing and customer service . For example , customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer 's records and add a new service , or business analysts may mine customer data for trends . According to the company 's website , its four primary product areas are revenue management , content management & monetization , customer interaction management and enterprise security . CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services . = = = Product history = = = CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services . Under new leadership in 1994 , it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments . During this period it developed CSG Work-Force Express , a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites . Work-Force Express consists of three applications : CSG Workforce Management , CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE , which integrate with CSG 's databases and billing systems . It also developed CSG Care Express , which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online . In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR ( Advanced Customer Service Representative ) system . An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow ! was introduced in 2003 . ProfitNow ! used a consumer 's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product . It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net. CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002 . Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other . CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets , with support for multiple languages . In March 2014 , CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio , under the name CSG Invotas . In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity . Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1 , 2016 . = = Organization = = CSG International has four subsidiaries : CSG Systems , CSG Systems Software and CSG Services .

                    "text": "Apollo Global Management = Apollo Global Management , LLC is an American private equity firm , founded in 1990 by former Drexel Burnham Lambert banker Leon Black . The firm specializes in leveraged buyout transactions and purchases of distressed securities involving corporate restructuring , special situations , and industry consolidations . Apollo is headquartered in New York City , and also has offices in Purchase , New York , Los Angeles , Houston , London , Frankfurt , Luxembourg , Singapore , Hong Kong and Mumbai . As of August 2015 , Apollo managed over US $ 162 billion of investor commitments across its private equity , credit and real estate funds and other investment vehicles making it one of the largest alternative investment management firms globally . Among the most notable companies currently owned by Apollo are Claire 's , Caesars Entertainment Corporation , Norwegian Cruise Line , Novitex Enterprise Solutions , and CORE Media Group ( American Idol ) . = = History = = Apollo , originally referred to as Apollo Advisors , was founded in 1990 , on the heels of the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert in February 1990 . It was founded by Leon Black , the former head of Drexel 's mergers and acquisitions department , along with other Drexel alumni . Among the most notable founders are John Hannan , Drexel 's former co-director of international finance ; Craig Cogut , a lawyer who worked with Drexel 's high-yield division in Los Angeles ; and Arthur Bilger , the former head of the corporate finance department . Other founding partners included Marc Rowan , Josh Harris and Michael Gross , who both worked under Black in the mergers and acquisitions department , and Antony Ressler , who worked as a senior vice president in Drexel 's high yield department with responsibility for the new issue / syndicate desk . Less than six months after the collapse of Drexel , the founders of Apollo had already begun a series of ventures . Apollo Investment Fund L.P. , the first of their private equity investment funds , was formed to make investments in distressed companies . Apollo 's first fund raised approximately $ 400 million of investor commitments on the strength of Black 's reputation as a prominent lieutenant of Michael Milken and key player in the buyout boom of the 1980s . Lion Advisors was set up to provide investment services to Credit Lyonnais , which was seeking to profit from depressed prices in the high yield market . = = = 1990s = = = At the time of Apollo 's founding , financing for new leveraged buyouts was minimal and Apollo turned instead to a strategy of distressed-to-control takeovers . Apollo would purchase distressed securities which could be converted into a controlling interest in the equity of the company through a bankruptcy reorganization or other restructuring . Apollo used distressed debt as an entry point , enabling the firm to invest in such firms as Vail Resorts , Walter Industries , Culligan and Samsonite . Early on , Apollo made a name for itself by acquiring interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasing high-yield bonds from failed savings and loans and insurance companies . Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from the U.S. government 's Resolution Trust Corporation . One of Apollo 's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company 's bond portfolio . Using this vehicle , Apollo would purchase the Executive Life portfolio , generating tremendous profits when the value of high yield bonds recovered , but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase . More than a decade after the purchase , in 2002 , California Attorney General Bill Lockyer accused Apollo , Leon Black , and an investor group led by French bank Credit Lyonnais , of illegally acquiring the assets and bond portfolio of Executive Life Insurance Co. in 1991 . According to the State of California , Lion allegedly violated a California law that prohibited foreign government-owned banks from owning California insurance companies . In 1993 , Apollo Real Estate Advisers was founded in collaboration with William Mack to seek opportunities in the U.S. property markets . Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund , L.P. , the first in a family of real estate \" opportunity funds \" was closed in April 1993 with $ 500 million of investor commitments . In 2000 , Apollo exited the partnership , which continued to operate as Apollo Real Estate Advisers until changing its name to AREA Property Partners , effective January 15 , 2009 . That firm is owned and controlled by its remaining principals , who include William Mack , Lee Neibart , William Benjamin , John Jacobsson , Stuart Koenig and Richard Mack . Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund , L.P. , the first in a family of real estate \" opportunity funds \" was closed in April 1993 with $ 500 million of investor commitments . As of 2008 , the firm was investing out of three funds : Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund V , Apollo European Real Estate Fund II and Apollo Value Enhancement Fund VII . In 2004 , Apollo Real Estate acquired the Value Enhancement Funds family of investment vehicles to broaden its offerings in the \" value-added \" segment of the real estate investment spectrum . Apollo also operates a real estate mezzanine lending program and real estate securities hedge fund called Claros Real Estate Securities Fund , L.P. In 1995 , Apollo raised its third private equity fund , Apollo Investment Fund III with $ 1.5 billion of investor commitments from investors that included CalPERS and the General Motors pension fund . Unlike its first two funds and later funds , Fund III would ultimately prove only an average performer for private equity funds of its vintage . Among the investments made in Fund III ( invested through 1998 ) were : Alliance Imaging , Allied Waste Industries , Breuners Home Furnishings , Levitz Furniture , Communications Corporation of America , Dominick 's , Ralphs ( acquired Apollo 's Food-4-Less ) , Move.com , NRT Incorporated , Pillowtex Corporation , Telemundo and WMC Mortgage Corporation . Also in 1995 , Apollo founding partner Craig Cogut left the firm to found a smaller competitor Pegasus Capital Advisors . Since inception Pegasus has raised $ 1.8 billion in four private equity funds focused on investments in middle-market companies in financial distress . In 1997 , Apollo co-founder Tony Ressler founded Ares Management as the successor to its Lion Advisors business which would manage collateralized debt obligation vehicles . In 1998 , Apollo raised its fourth private equity fund , Apollo Investment Fund IV , with $ 3.6 billion of investor commitments . Among the investments made in Fund IV ( invested through 2001 ) were : Allied Waste Industries , AMC Entertainment , Berlitz International , Clark Retail Enterprises , Corporate Express ( Buhrmann ) , Encompass Services Corporation , National Financial Partners , Pacer International , Rent-A-Center , Resolution Performance Products , Resolution Specialty Materials , Sirius Satellite Radio , SkyTerra Communications , United Rentals and Wyndham Worldwide . = = = 2000-2005 = = = Apollo deployed its fourth fund during the booming markets of the late 1990s , only to experience difficulties with the collapse of the Internet bubble and the onset of the recession . Amid the turmoil of collapsing markets , Apollo was able to raise its fifth private equity fund in 2001 , Apollo Investment Fund V , with $ 3.7 billion of investor commitments , roughly the same amount raised as for its previous fund . Among the investments made in Fund V ( invested through 2006 ) were Affinion Group , AMC Entertainment , Berry Plastics , Cablecom , Compass Minerals , General Nutrition Centers ( GNC ) , Goodman Global , Hexion Specialty Chemicals ( Borden ) , Intelsat , Linens \u2018 n Things , Metals USA , Nalco Investment Holdings , Sourcecorp , Spectrasite Communications , and Unity Media . Meanwhile , Ares continued to grow through the late 1990s , and profited significantly from investments made after the collapse of the high yield market in 2000 and 2001 . Although technically , the founders of Ares had completed a spin out with the formation of the firm in 1997 , they had maintained a close relationship with Apollo over its first five years and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo . By 2002 , when Ares raised its first corporate opportunities fund , the firm announced that it was more formally separating itself from its former parent company . The timing of this separation also coincided with Apollo 's legal difficulties with the State of California over its purchase of Executive Life Insurance Company in 1991 . Following the spin-off of Ares in 2002 , Apollo developed two new affiliates to continue its investment activities in the capital markets . The first of these new affiliates , founded in 2003 , was Apollo Distressed Investment Fund ( DIF ) Management a credit opportunity investment vehicle . The following year , in April 2004 , Apollo raised $ 930 million through an initial public offering ( IPO ) for a listed business development company , Apollo Investment Corporation ( NASDAQ : AINV ) ) . Apollo Investment Corporation was formed to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine debt and senior secured loans , as well as by making certain direct equity investments in companies . The Company also invests in the securities of public companies . = = = 2005-2010 = = = The 2005 - 2007 period marked a boom period in private equity with new \" largest buyout \" records set and surpassed several times in an 18-month window from the beginning of 2006 through the middle of 2007 . Apollo was among the most active investors in leveraged buyout transactions during this period . Although Apollo was involved in a number of notable and large buyouts , the firm largely avoided the very largest transactions of this period . Among Apollo 's most notable investments during this period included Harrah 's Entertainment , a leading US gaming and casino company ; Norwegian Cruise Line , the cruise line operator ; Claire 's Stores , the retailer of costume jewelry ; and Realogy , the real estate franchisor that owns Coldwell Banker , Century 21 and Sotheby 's International Realty . In August 2006 , Apollo launched a $ 2 billion publicly traded private equity vehicle in Europe , AP Alternative Assets ( ENXTAM : AAA ) . The IPO of this new vehicle followed in the footsteps of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts , which raised $ 5 billion for its KKR Private Equity Investors vehicle in May 2006 . Apollo initially attempted to raise $ 2.5 billion for the public vehicle , but fell short when it offered the shares in June , raising only $ 1.5 billion . Apollo raised an additional $ 500 million via private placements in the weeks following that sale . As the private equity industry expanded through 2006 and 2007 , several of the largest private equity firms , most notably The Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts , announced plans to realize value from their firms through the sale of shares in the public equity markets . Apollo Management chose a slightly different path , by completing a private placement of shares in its management company in July 2007 . By pursuing a private placement rather than a public offering , Apollo would be able to avoid much of the public scrutiny applied to Blackstone and KKR . In November 2007 , Apollo was able to realize additional value from the sale of a 9 % ownership interest in its management company to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) . Ultimately , in April 2008 , Apollo would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to permit some holders of its privately traded stock to sell their shares on the New York Stock Exchange and in March 2011 , Apollo completed its initial public offering ( NYSE : APO ) . In 2008 , the firm opened an office in India , marking their first push into Asia . As the deterioration of the financial markets worsened into 2008 , Apollo saw several of its investments come under pressure . Apollo 's 2005 investment in the struggling US retailer , Linens ' n Things suffered from a significant debt burden and softening consumer demand . In May 2008 , Linens was forced to file for bankruptcy protection , one of several high profile retail bankruptcies in 2008 , costing Apollo all of its $ 365 million investment in the company . At the same time , Apollo 's investment in Claire 's , Realogy and Harrah 's Entertainment came under pressure . Apollo would respond actively to its investment difficulties seeking to exchange a portion of the existing debt at Harrah 's and Realogy to more favorable securities . At Claire 's , Apollo exercised its \" PIK toggle \" option to shut off cash interest payments to its bondholders and issue more debt instead , in order to provide the company with additional financial flexibility . In December 2008 , Apollo completed fundraising for its latest fund , Apollo Investment Fund VII with approximately $ 14.7 billion of investor commitments . Apollo had been targeting $ 15 billion , but had been in fundraising for more than 16 months , with the bulk of the capital raised in 2007 . In December 2009 , it was announced that Apollo would acquire Cedar Fair Entertainment Company shares and the company would be become private underneath the management group . The deal includes a cash payment of $ 635 million and assumed debt which gives the transaction a value of $ 2.4 billion . It was later announced in April 2010 that the deal was pulled due to poor shareholder response . = = = 2010-2015 = = = In March 2012 it made a second attempt to acquire an amusement park operator with a $ 225.7 million offer for Great Wolf Resorts . In November 2012 , The McGraw-Hill Companies sold their education division ( \" McGraw-Hill Education \" ) to Apollo Global Management , in a deal totaling $ 2.5 billion . On 11 March 2013 , Apollo Global Management made the only bid for the snacks business of Hostess Brands , including Twinkies , for $ 410 million . In December 2013 , Apollo bought a portfolio of Irish home loans from Lloyds Bank for \u20ac 307m , less than half their nominal \u00a3 610m ( \u20ac 367m ) value . The shares were bought by an Apollo Global Management subsidiary , Tanager Limited . The portfolio made a \u00a3 33m loss last year . On 16 January 2014 , The Financial Times reported Apollo will buy CEC Entertainment , the parent of Chuck E. Cheese 's , for about $ 1 billion . In June 2015 , Apollo Global Management made a successful offer of around $ 1.03 billion in cash to privatise OM Group . Also that month , Apollo won the bidding during an auction for Saint-Gobain \u2019 s Verallia glass bottle manufacturing unit for a rumoured fee of around 2.95 billion . In June 2016 , Apollo Global Management made a successful offer to purchase Diamond Resorts International . = = Operations = = Apollo is operated by its managing partners , Leon Black , Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan and a team of more than 250 investment professionals , as of March 31 , 2013 .

Her younger sister was Jacqueline ' Jackie ' Dykins ( born 26 October 1949 ) . Lennon started visiting the Dykins ' house in 1951 . After the death of Julia Lennon in 1958 , Harriet and Norman Birch were appointed guardians of Julia and Jackie , ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married their mother . Lennon invited the Dykins sisters to visit after the success of the Beatles , when he was living in Kenwood , Weybridge , with his then-wife , Cynthia Lennon . Julia Dykins ( Baird ) married Allen Baird in 1968 and moved to Belfast . They had three children together but were divorced in 1981 . Baird worked as a special needs teacher , and after Lennon 's death she wrote John Lennon , My Brother ( with Geoffrey Giuliano ) and gave up working in 2004 to write Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon . She is now a director of Cavern City Tours in Liverpool . = = Early years = = Baird 's mother , Julia Lennon , was the fourth of five children in the Stanley family : Mary , known as ' Mimi ' ( 1906 \u2013 1991 ) , Elizabeth ' Mater ' ( 1908 \u2013 1976 ) , Anne ' Nanny ' ( 1911 \u2013 1988 ) , Julia ' Judy ' ( 1914 \u2013 1958 ) , and Harriet ' Harrie ' ( 1916 \u2013 1972 ) . John Lennon was Julia 's first child by Alfred Lennon , although she later had a daughter called Victoria ( renamed Ingrid ) after an affair with a Welsh soldier while Alfred was at sea . Julia was forced to give up the child for adoption after intense pressure from her father and her sisters . Although they had known each other previously , Julia started dating Dykins while working in a caf\u00e9 near Mosspits , which was Lennon 's primary school . Dykins was said to be a good-looking , well-dressed man who was several years older than Julia and worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward . Julia later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins , who had access to rationed goods like alcohol , chocolate , silks and cigarettes . The Stanley sisters called Dykins a \" spiv \" , because of his pencil-thin moustache , margarine-coated hair , and pork-pie hat , but the young Lennon called him \" Twitchy \" because of a physical tic and nervous cough Dykins had . Although Julia never divorced Alfred Lennon , she was the common-law wife of Dykins , although Paul McCartney admitted to being sarcastic to Lennon about his mother living in sin while Julia was still married . Julia 's sister , Mimi , called Julia and Dykins ' home \u2014 at 1 Blomfield Road , Liverpool \u2014 \" The House of Sin \" and her own house ( where Lennon lived ) \" The House of Correction \" . When Jackie was born prematurely on 26 October 1949 , Julia went back to the hospital every day to see her , although she was often not allowed ( by Mimi ) to visit Lennon . Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool , which allowed Julia to stay at home at Blomfield Road , to look after Baird , Jackie , a cat named \" Elvis \" , and the 11-year-old Lennon , who had started to visit and occasionally stayed overnight . Baird would give up her bed to Lennon , and share Jackie 's double bed . Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money ( one shilling ) for doing odd jobs , such as collecting golf balls on the local course , on top of the five shillings that Lennon 's Aunt Mimi gave him . During Lennon 's visits , he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie , test Baird 's spelling , and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend . Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them , her mother would often play a record called , My Son John , To Me You Are So Wonderful , \" by some old crooner , and sit and listen to it \" . \" My Son John \" \u2014 sung by David Whitfield \u2014 was released in 1956 . Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt 's croft in Sango Bay , Durness , Scotland , for his holidays , he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family . Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street , Liverpool , to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen on the back of a flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957 . Baird was allowed to sit on the back , but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off . The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool 's charter by King John . Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road because they said the acoustics \" sounded like a recording studio \" . = = = Legal guardian = = = Baird 's mother was struck and killed on 15 July 1958 , just outside Mimi 's home , by a Standard Vanguard car driven by an off-duty constable , PC Eric Clague , who was a learner-driver . Clague later said : \" Mrs Lennon just ran straight out in front of me . I just couldn 't avoid her . I was not speeding , I swear it . It was just one of those terrible things that happen . \" Baird and Jackie ( aged eleven and eight respectively ) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater 's , and were not allowed to attend the funeral . They were told two months later by Norman Birch ( Lennon 's uncle ) that their mother had died . Lennon 's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls \u2014 ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married Julia . Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool . Her grave is unmarked , and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . Baird and Jackie were taken to live with the Birches and their son at The Dairy Cottage , which was owned by Mimi 's husband , George Smith . At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself , where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House , although Baird and her friends called it \" frothy coffee \" . At 16 , Baird started to hitch-hike to London , although her Aunt never knew , as she would never have allowed it . Baird talked about the trips to London , and how relatively safe they were : \" Hitching was easy then . It was a way of life . Everything was becoming more free . We 'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties . People always gave us a place to stay \u2013 we were never harmed . \" Baird and Jackie were asked to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964 . Cynthia Lennon \u2014 Lennon 's wife at the time \u2014 took them both out shopping in Knightsbridge , buying them expensive clothes . During the same visit , The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria , and the sisters asked to be allowed to stand near the front , but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush . In December 1965 , Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane . Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards . Dykins had married again , but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife , and did not attend their father 's funeral . In 1968 , Lennon was told The Dairy Cottage was too cramped for them all , so he told Birch to buy a house , and he found a 4-bedroom house in Gateacre Park Drive , Liverpool . Lennon told Birch to furnish and decorate it , and to send all the bills to him . The Dykinses heard nothing from Lennon for years , until he phoned Baird in 1975 , and asked for mementos of his childhood life , such as his school tie and photographs . He sent \u00a3 3,000 to cover the cost of shipping and as a gift , but wrote , \" Don 't tell Mimi \" . Lennon continued to call Baird until 1976 , when the calls stopped . Jackie worked as a shop assistant during the 1970s , but battled against a heroin addiction . In the 1980s , and fully recovered , Jackie gave birth to her son , John , later working as a hairstylist . After Lennon and Harriet died , Yoko Ono wanted to sell the house \u2014 as it was still in Lennon 's name \u2014 but later gave it to the Salvation Army on 2 November 1993 , even though Lennon had once written : \" I always thought of the house he 's in [ Birch ] as my contribution towards looking after Julia [ Baird ] and Jackie . I would prefer the girls to use it . \" = = Later years = = Julia married Allen Baird in 1968 , they moved to Belfast and kept her family history a secret . The Bairds had three children : Nicholas ( b . 1971 ) , Sara ( b . 1972 ) and David ( b . 1980 ) , and were divorced in 1981 . Baird went to university and gained an MA in philosophy of education , and during her the course of her degree she spent a year off in France , hitch-hiked around Europe , and protested against the war in Vietnam in Paris alongside Simone de Beauvoir . Baird later taught French and English before working as a special needs teacher with teenagers in deprived areas of Chester , until she retired to write books and become a director of Cavern City Tours . Baird and Jackie met their half-sister Ingrid Pedersen for the first time when they were present at the ceremony to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi 's house , commemorating the fact that Lennon had lived there . Baird and Jackie had only recently found out who Pedersen was , after being told by journalist Bill Smithies of the Liverpool Echo . Baird was shocked that Pedersen did not look anything like the Stanley or the Lennon family , having pale blue eyes and fair hair . After releasing the book , John Lennon , My Brother \u2014 written with Giuliano , and a foreword by McCartney \u2014 Baird travelled to New York during 1989 to appear at a Beatlefest convention , and was asked if she could prove she was really Lennon 's half-sister . Baird declined , saying she was not going to produce her passport , and the audience would just have to take her word for it . In 2000 , Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs , erected on major routes into Liverpool , saying , \" Liverpool welcomes you \u2013 to the birthplace of THE BEATLES \" , and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool 's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon 's birthday . Baird retired in 2004 , and published a book called Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon , in February 2007 . From 28 to 30 September 2007 , Durness held the John Lennon Northern Lights Festival which was attended by Baird ( who read from Lennon 's writings and her own books ) and Stanley Parkes ( Lennon 's Scottish cousin ) . Parkes said , \" Me and Julia [ Baird ] are going to be going to the old family croft to tell stories \" . Musicians , painters and poets from across the UK performed at the festival . Baird now lives in Chester with her partner , Roger Keys . Baird claims she was never told that her mother was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool , although the graveyard 's location is approximately 1.19 miles east of 1 Blomfield Road . The grave was unmarked , but was recently identified as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . The Stanley family finally put a headstone on her mother 's grave . The headstone reads : Mummy John Victoria Julie Jackie .",

                    "text": "Carolina Marsh Tacky = The Carolina Marsh Tacky or Marsh Tacky is a rare breed of horse , native to South Carolina . It is a member of the Colonial Spanish group of horse breeds , which also include the Florida Cracker Horse and the Banker horse of North Carolina . It is a small horse , well adapted for use in the lowland swamps of its native South Carolina . The Marsh Tacky developed from Spanish horses brought to the South Carolina coast by Spanish explorers , settlers and traders as early as the 16th century . The horses were used by the colonists during the American Revolution , and by South Carolinians for farm work , herding cattle and hunting throughout the breed 's history . The breed is considered to be critically endangered by both the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust , and there are only around 275 Marsh Tackies in existence today . In 2006 and 2007 , the two organizations worked together to complete DNA testing on the breed with the goals of mapping the Marsh Tacky 's place among the horse breeds of the world and beginning a stud book . In 2007 , an association was begun with the objective of preserving and promoting the Marsh Tacky ; and in 2010 a closed stud book was created . = = Characteristics = = The Marsh Tacky generally stands between 14 and 14.2 hands ( 56 and 58 inches , 142 and 147 cm ) high , although the acceptable range is between 13 and 15 hands ( 52 and 60 inches , 132 and 152 cm ) high . Today , the breed comes in a wide variety of colors , including dun , bay , roan , chestnut , black and grullo . Historically , multi-colored patterns such as pinto were found , but they were not selected for when breeding , and today are not seen . The colors today are consistent with those of other Colonial Spanish horses . The profile of the breed 's head is usually flat or somewhat concave , becoming slightly convex from the nasal region to the top of the muzzle . The forehead is wide and the eyes set well apart . The breed typically has a slight ewe neck , and the neck is attached low on the chest compared to many other breeds . The withers are pronounced , the back short and strong , and the croup steeply angled . The chest is deep but narrow and the shoulder long and angled . The legs have long , tapering muscling , with in general no feathering on the lower legs . The Marsh Tacky exhibits a four-beat ambling gait , most similar to the marcha batida of the Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador , another breed with Spanish heritage , although also compared to the fox trot of the Missouri Fox Trotter . However , the Marsh Tacky 's gait shows a period of quadrupedal support where all four feet are planted and diagonal foot pairings , whereas the Fox Trotter shows tripedal support and the Mangalarga Marchador lacks the diagonal foot pairings . The Marsh Tacky is known by owners for its stamina and ability to work in water and swamps without panicking . They tend to be sure-footed , sturdy , smart , and able to survive in challenging coastal environments , as well as being easy keepers . Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women , but they were also used as working animals due to their abilities in the field . Today , they are used in endurance riding , as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle . Marsh Tackies have the same ancestral bloodlines as Florida Cracker Horses and North Carolina Banker horses . However , DNA testing has proved that the Marsh Tackies ' relative isolation has made them a separate breed with unique characteristics . = = History = = The Carolina Marsh Tacky developed from Spanish horses brought to the island and coastal areas of South Carolina by Spanish explorers and settlers as early as the 16th century . More horses were added to the population that would become the Marsh Tacky through animals that were purchased in the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine in Florida . They were then used as pack horses on Native American trade routes , and sold when the traders reached Charleston . They were managed mainly as feral herds , rounded up by locals when horses were needed , and this tradition continued into the 20th century . The breed was used during the American Revolution by many of the irregular forces of Francis Marion , nicknamed the \" Swamp Fox \" . The swamp savvy of the Marsh Tacky may have given Marion 's forces an advantage , as British cavalry mounted on larger European breeds were not as easily able to maneuver in the dense lowland swamps . After the American Civil War , they were commonly used by members of the Gullah community on the islands off the South Carolina shore for use in fields and gardens . The breed derives the \" tacky \" part of its name from the English word meaning \" common \" or \" cheap \" , as these horses were the most common breed in their area of the country for most of their history . During the height of their popularity they ranged from Myrtle Beach , South Carolina to St. Simon 's Island in Georgia . The Tackies continued to be used during World War II by members of the beach patrols tasked with the surveillance of South Carolina beaches against Nazi u-boat attacks and enemy troop or spy landings . During the 1960s , Marsh Tackies were used in races on Hilton Head beaches . This tradition was revived in 2009 during the Gullah Cultural Festival , and the races will be continued at the festival in future years . In 2007 , the Carolina Marsh Tacky Association was formed . The association was developed through the efforts of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy working with owners and breed enthusiasts , with the goal of preserving and promoting the Marsh Tacky breed . The breed registry became a closed registry on August 18 , 2010 , and is maintained by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Pedigree Registry . Although closed , outside horses can be registered upon proof of origin , visual inspection and DNA confirmation of parentage . In 2015 , a complete , articulated horse skeleton believed to be a Marsh Tacky was unearthed at an archaeological dig in St. Augustine , Florida . The approximately 200-year-old skeleton was found on the site which once housed the Spanish Dragoon Barracks . = = Conservation = = In the lowcountry region of coastal Georgia and South Carolina , the Carolina Marsh Tacky was the most common horse for most of the breed 's history . As the automobile became more common during the 20th century , breed numbers declined , and the Marsh Tacky was thought to have gone extinct during the 1980s and 1990s . Today there are 276 living animals recognized by the breed registry , including 153 mares and 123 stallions and geldings . The Equus Survival Trust considers the breed to be at critical / nearly extinct levels , meaning that there are fewer than 100 breeding mares in existence . The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers the Marsh Tacky ( which they consider a strain of the Colonial Spanish horse ) to be at critical levels , meaning that there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and an estimated global population of less than 2,000 . Representatives of the ALBC state that the breed numbers will have to increase to an estimated 1,000 members to ensure permanent survival . On June 11 , 2010 , a bill was signed into law that made the Carolina Marsh Tacky the state heritage horse of South Carolina . In 2006 , the ALBC began investigating the Marsh Tacky to see if it was truly a descendent of Spanish stock , and during the organization 's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type of Colonial Spanish stock . In 2007 , the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina , considered to be the largest remaining herd , with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War . DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook , reveal what DNA markers the breed carries , and map the breed 's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide . Sixty horses were tested in the effort .",

                    "text": "Clumber Spaniel = The Clumber Spaniel is a breed of dog of the spaniel type , developed in the United Kingdom . It is the largest of the spaniels , and comes in predominantly white with either lemon or orange markings , but can sometimes be either brown or lemon predominantly . The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire where the breed was first developed . It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover . They are gentle and loyal , and can act aloof with strangers . They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages , including a constant shedding of its coat and snoring . The history of the breed is uncertain prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent . Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various British Monarchs , including Prince Albert , King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844 , and in 1884 became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club . The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation . = = Description = = = = = Appearance = = = The Clumber Spaniel is the largest of the spaniels , and is long and heavy-bodied , standing only 17 to 20 inches ( 43 to 51 cm ) in height but weighing from 55 to 85 pounds ( 25 to 39 kg ) . It is similar in shape to the smaller Sussex Spaniel . The Clumber has a heavy bone structure , has a massive ' melting ' head with a mournful and sleepy expression , a square nose and muzzle , and large vine-leaf shaped ears . Freckles on the muzzle and front legs are common . Its coat is dense , weather-resistant , straight , and flat with feathering around the ears , belly and legs . Clumbers are predominantly white in colour with lemon , brown , or orange markings around the eyes , and at the base of the tail . = = = Temperament = = = Their temperament is described as gentle , loyal and affectionate , but dignified and aloof with strangers . They can appear to be a sedate breed and enjoy curling up on the couch , eating and sleeping . Clumber Spaniels shed at a medium pace . Clumbers tend to drool because of their very droopy flews . Clumbers have minds of their own . Puppies are especially curious and playful . The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry something most of the time ; unfortunately this can lead to health issues as they may ingest the items . The breed has been used to hunt pheasant and partridge , in both small packs and alone . It is well-suited for work in upland hunting in dense cover , and although the Clumber is rather slow in the field compared to other spaniels , it is a quiet worker with a fine nose and good stamina . The broad muzzle of the breed allows it to retrieve a variety of game . = = Health = = Because Clumber Spaniels are large boned and fast growing , they can suffer from temporary lameness from between six and twelve months of age , with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete . Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs and the dog may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian . The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity : if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade , they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated . In addition , Clumbers often have difficulties conceiving and giving birth , and may require caesarian sections . Some dogs may suffer from sensitivity to anaesthesia . The most common severe health conditions in the Clumber Spaniel are entropion / ectropion eye conditions , spinal disc herniation and hip dysplasia . They have a median lifespan of around 10 years . = = = Entropion / Ectropion = = = Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid , commonly the lower lid . This in turn irritates the cornea of the eye and can cause visual impairment . It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels , King Charles Spaniels , English Springer Spaniels plus a variety of non spaniel breeds . Ectropion is the outward rolling of the eyelid , which abnormally exposes the eye , resulting in irritation . Because of the increased exposure , the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome . It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer , Bloodhound , Gordon Setter as well as the English and American Cocker Spaniels , and the English Springer Spaniel . The treatment for ectropion varies depending on the severity of the condition . The only treatment for entropion is surgical , and may be delayed until the dog reaches adulthood as whilst a puppy the facial structures of the animal are still growing and changing . Dogs who have surgical correction for defects such as entropion or ectropion may not be exhibited in the show ring . = = = Spinal disc herniation = = = Spinal disc herniation occurs when the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides . Once the cord is compressed , the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back / neck pain to leg paralysis , loss of sensation , and urinary and fecal incontinence . The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area , but it may occur anywhere along the spine . Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks , and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain . Surgery can restore sensation to a dog 's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was . = = = Hip dysplasia = = = Hip dysplasia is a hereditary condition which occurs in most dog breeds to some extent , according to scores from a 2001 UK Kennel Club scheme , the Clumber Spaniel has the second worst breed mean scores . Furthermore , a survey conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 45.7 % of Clumber Spaniels tested were affected by the condition . Initial signs are usually first noted when the dog is between five and twelve months old , and may include a swaying hindleg gait , hindleg lameness , muscle wastage around the hindquarters , reluctance to and fatigue during exercise , inability to climb stairs or jump up . The dog can appear hunched up with an arched back , and in the very worst cases may wince with pain when moving its hindlegs . Medical treatment can vary from the administration of painkillers to surgical correction depending on the severity of the condition . = = History = = The breed 's history is uncertain before the middle of the 19th century . One theory is that it originated in France , stating that the Duc de Noailles at the time of the French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire . The theory goes , that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was breed with Basset Hounds , and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees . A second theory is that it is descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel , which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel . Originally these dogs were large gundogs , colored lemon and white whereas the modern breed of them is a much smaller lap / toy breed of dog . What is certain is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of Newcastle 's gamekeeper , William Mansell , is credited with their development and improvement . Prince Albert , the Prince consort of Queen Victoria , was a fancier and promoter of the breed , as was his son King Edward VII , who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk . The breed was shown in England from 1859 onward . They are referred to in Queen Victoria 's diary : on October 16 , 1840 , she wrote , \" Walked out directly after breakfast before Albert went to shoot . He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with us and we went into the Slopes , with such a funny old Gamekeeper , Walters , in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game . They are such dear , nice dogs . \" Until the mid 19th century the breeding of the Clumber Spaniel was mostly restricted to the nobility . During World War I breeding was stopped entirely causing their numbers to decrease to a record low . In 1925 , King George V re-developed a line of Clumbers in the Royal Kennel and were used in the fields in the Sandringham Estate . Sh . Ch . Raycroft Socialite , bred by Rae Furness and owned by Ralph Dunne of County Cavan , Ireland , won the coveted honor of Best In Show at the 1991 Crufts Centenary Show . The Clumber Spaniel is currently recognised as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the UK Kennel Club , which means it is a breed which fewer than 300 new registrations each year . Other spaniels recognised as such are the Field Spaniel , Irish Water Spaniel and Sussex Spaniel . = = = Clumber Spaniels in North America = = = While the breed was not shown widely in the United States prior to the late 1960s , in 1844 , Lieutenant Venables , an officer of the British regiment stationed in Halifax , Nova Scotia , introduced the Clumber Spaniel to North America . The first Clumber Spaniel listed in the AKC registry , recorded for the date of 1878 was Bustler , an orange and white dog owned by Benjamin Smith of Nova Scotia . The Clumber Spaniel became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1884 . The first Clumber Spaniel was entered in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1878 . Champion Clussexx Country Sunrise ( \" Brady \" ) , bred by Doug Johnson and owned by Richard and Judith Zaleski of Florida , became the only Clumber to win Best in Show there in 1996 .",

                    "text": "Galloway cattle = The Galloway is one of the world 's longest established breeds of beef cattle , named after the Galloway region of Scotland , where it originated , during the 17th century . It is now found in many parts of the world , such as Canada , the USA and Australia . It is now found in many parts of the world , being exported to Canada in 1853 , the US in 1882 and Australia in 1951 . The breed enjoyed success during the 1950s but this subsided during the foot and mouth crisis . Today , the breed is enjoying a revival , due to the demands of the beef market . The breed is considered average size and they have a thick coat , due to the climate of their native Scotland . = = Etymology = = Galloway was an ancient region located in the south-west of Scotland . The word ' Galloway ' is derived from the words Gallovid , or Gaul . The Gauls were the south of Scotland . = = History = = The Galloway breed comes from the cattle native to the south-west region of Scotland , first fully developed in the 17th century . Originally there was much variation within this breed , including many different colours and patterns . The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle , but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population , and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book . As a result , although black is still the most common colour for Galloways , they can also be red and several shades of dun . In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed . The Galloway was introduced in Canada in 1853 , first registered in 1872 , and the first Galloway registry was introduced in the USA in 1882 . In 1911 , 35,000 cattle were registered in the American Galloway Herd Book which was first created in 1882 . The British Galloway Society formed in 1908 . They did not recognise dun coloured Galloway cattle , which was met with outrage and this ban was later lifted . In 1951 , Galloway cattle were introduced to Australia . In the 1950s the breed enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input ( feed ) cattle with high quality meat . However , the BSE crisis ( commonly referred to as mad cow disease ) caused an export ban in 1990 , although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle . This created a fear associated with cattle , so breed numbers declined . Recent years have seen changes as bigger leaner carcasses were demanded . This issue of size featured in Galloway circles causes great debate . Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer . Today the breed 's original characteristics are now back in demand . This is due to the demand of high quality meat that requires economical production . = = Characteristics = = The average Galloway cow will weigh 1000 to 1500 pounds and the average bull weighing 1700 to 2300 pounds . The healthy birth weight for a calf is 75 pounds . Galloways have a thick double-layered coat that is wavy or curly . This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies so well that they have a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies , which would otherwise create waste at slaughter . This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates . Despite the animal 's usual use in beef production , there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production . The Galloway is naturally hornless , and instead of horns has a bone knob at the top of its skull called the poll . This breed 's shaggy coat has both a thick , woolly undercoat for warmth and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water , making them well adapted to harsher climates . = = = Population = = = It is thought that the breed number fewer than 10,000 cattle in the world , most located in Northern Europe , specifically Scotland . The breed is ' rare ' in the United States and the Livestock Conservancy class it as a breed to ' watch ' . = = Societies = = Galloway Cattle Society of New Zealand American Galloway Breeders Association The Galloway Cattle Society of Great Britain and Ireland Australian Galloway Association",

                    "text": "Duke of Marmalade = Duke of Marmalade ( foaled 12 March 2004 ) is a retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire . He is best known for winning five consecutive Group One races in 2008 , for which he was named European Champion Older Horse . Upon retirement at the end of the 2008 racing season he stood as a stallion for Coolmore Stud , being moved between stud farms in Ireland and Australia ( a practice known as shuttling ) . In July 2014 he was sold and relocated to Drakenstein Stud in South Africa where he currently stands . Duke of Marmalade was owned during his racing career by Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor , winning his first two races as a two-year-old in June 2006 . He did not win again until the spring of his four-year-old season , almost twenty-two months later . During this winless period he was sometimes regarded as little more than a pacemaker for more celebrated stable companions such as Dylan Thomas . In his final year of racing he recorded wins in the Prix Ganay , the Tattersalls Gold Cup , the Prince of Wales 's Stakes , the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and International Stakes . He was retired in October 2008 after running in the Breeders ' Cup Classic . Duke of Marmalade sired four European Classic winners in 2015 , namely Nutan , Star of Seville , Simple Verse and Sound of Freedom . = = Background = = Duke of Marmalade is a bay horse standing 16 hands high bred in Ireland by Southern Bloodstock. a division of his owners ' Coolmore Stud organisation . Duke of Marmalade weighed 540 kg during his racing career and was trained by Aidan O 'Brien at Ballydoyle . Duke of Marmalade was one of the last crop of foals sired by Danehill one of the most successful stallions of the last twenty years , producing the winners of more than a thousand races , including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One / Grade I level . Among his best offspring are Dylan Thomas , Rock of Gibraltar , George Washington and North Light . Love Me True is a half-sister to Shuailaan ( Winter Hill Stakes ) , Madison 's Charm ( Comely Stakes ) and Bite The Bullet ( Sanford Stakes ) , and , as a granddaughter of Lassie Dear , is closely related to Summer Squall , A. P. Indy and Lemon Drop Kid . The name \" Duke of Marmalade \" is derived from a title created by Henri Christophe for a member of the new Haitian nobility following the Haitian Revolution . The name had previously been used for an Italian thoroughbred racehorse which won the Premio Roma in 1975 and 1976 . = = Racing career = = = = = 2006 : two-year-old season = = = Duke of Marmalade began his career with three races in the summer of 2006 . In June he made his debut in a six furlong maiden race at Leopardstown . Ridden by Seamie Heffernan and starting at odds of 11 / 4 ( 2.75-1 ) favourite , he was towards the back of the field in the early stages before making progress in the last two furlongs to finish second to Chanting . Nine days later he reappeared in a maiden race over seven furlongs at The Curragh for which he was made 4 / 6 favourite ( approximately 0.67-1 ) . He \" stayed on well \" to record his first win , beating Supposition by a neck ( approximately a quarter of a length ) , under Kieren Fallon . Duke of Marmalade was then moved directly into Group Two class ; he was sent to England for the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood in July , where his opponents included the July Stakes winner Strategic Prince . Ridden by Michael Kinane he raced just behind the leaders before being moved forward to challenge the leaders in the straight . He made ground steadily , but was unable to reach the front and finished second , beaten by a neck by Strategic Prince . Before his run at Goodwood , Duke of Marmalade had been supported in the betting for the following year 's 2000 Guineas , but shortly after the race he suffered a pastern injury which required surgery ; as a result , he did not race again in 2006 . = = = 2007 : three-year-old season = = = In 2007 Duke of Marmalade did not record a victory in six starts . However , he was never further back than fourth and ran exclusively in Group One races . He was often part of a multiple entry by the Ballydoyle team . Instead of running in a trial race , Duke of Marmalade was sent straight to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas . The field of twenty-four runners split into two groups , one on either side of the wide Newmarket course . Duke of Marmalade tracked the leaders of the stands side group before staying on to finish fourth to Cockney Rebel . Having returned from an absence of more than nine months , the colt was expected to improve for the run , but later in the same month he finished fourth again to Cockney Rebel in the Irish 2000 Guineas . At Royal Ascot , Duke of Marmalade showed improved form in the St. James 's Palace Stakes . Michael Kinane tried to lead all the way on the colt-and was still in front inside the final furlong-before being caught and beaten a neck by Jamie Spencer on his stable companion Excellent Art , with another O 'Brien-trained runner , Astronomer Royal in third , and Cockney Rebel in fifth . Two months later , Duke of Marmalade was moved up in distance and took on older horses for the first time in the International Stakes at York . He ran up to his best form in a highly competitive race to finish fourth behind the Derby winner Authorized , Dylan Thomas and Notnowcato . Duke of Marmalade raced against his stable companion Dylan Thomas again in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September . He led into the straight before being overtaken by Dylan Thomas , and although he had no chance with the winner he stayed on to take second ahead of notable winners such as Red Rocks ( Breeders ' Cup Turf ) , Maraahel ( Hardwicke Stakes ) and Finsceal Beo ( 1000 Guineas ) . O 'Brien was pleased with the run and said that Duke of Marmalade was still improving . On his final start of the year he was brought back to one mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he led until the last quarter mile , setting a strong pace , before finishing third to Ramonti and Excellent Art . During the winter it was discovered that a metal pin used to repair his previous injury had been causing the horse discomfort and was restricting his movement . The pin was removed , allowing Duke of Marmalade to run free of pain as a four-year-old . = = = 2008 : four-year-old season = = = = = = = Spring = = = = As a four-year-old Duke of Marmalade had a notable run of success , winning his first five races . In all these races he was ridden by Johnny Murtagh and was usually accompanied by his pacemaker Red Rock Canyon . In April he was sent to Longchamp for the Group One Prix Ganay . He raced behind Spirit One before making his challenge in the straight and running on strongly under pressure to beat Saddex by half a length . It was his first major win , and his first win of any kind for more than twenty-one months . After the race , O 'Brien called Duke of Marmalade \" a horse to look forward to \" . At the Curragh a month later , he justified odds of 1 / 3 ( 0.33-1 ) in the Tattersalls Gold Cup , being driven out by Murtagh to beat the filly Finsceal Beo by one and a quarter lengths . = = = = Summer = = = = In the Prince of Wales 's Stakes at Royal Ascot he produced what his trainer considered his best performance to date , taking over from Red Rock Canyon in the straight where he \" stormed clear \" to win by four lengths from Phoenix Tower . The Guardian called it a \" brilliant victory \" while Murtagh described the colt as among the best he had ridden . He then stepped up to twelve furlongs for Britain 's most prestigious weight-for-age race , the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes , for which he was made 4 / 6 ( 0.67-1 ) favourite . With no three-year-old in the field , the race did not appear to be up to its usual standard , and his main opponent was expected to be Youmzain who had finished second in the Ascot race and the Prix de l 'Arc de Triomphe in 2007 and had more recently won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud . Duke of Marmalade was settled by Murtagh in the middle of the field before being switched to the outside in the straight and overtaking Red Rock Canyon entering the final furlong . He was immediately challenged and headed by the Michael Stoute-trained Papal Bull but \" rallied gamely \" to regain the lead close to the finish and win by a half a length . Murtagh was keen to praise the horse 's speed and attitude , saying \" mine has all that makes a real champion . He looked the other horse in the eye and ate ground . He has that will to win . \" Duke of Marmalade was then brought back in distance from twelve furlongs to ten and a half furlongs for the International Stakes . The race also attracted the Epsom Derby winner New Approach , and the meeting of the two champions was much anticipated by the press as a \" clash of the titans \" . Bad ground conditions forced the race to be abandoned , and it was rescheduled for Newmarket four days later . Duke of Marmalade took the lead three furlongs out and was driven out by Murtagh to beat Phoenix Tower by three-quarters of a length , with New Approach , who had pulled hard and failed to settle in the early stages , two and a half lengths further back in third . The colt 's toughness and strong constitution were singled out for praise , with the press referring to him as the \" Iron Duke \" . O 'Brien and his jockeys were later found guilty of using unfair tactics in the race and were punished by the British Horseracing Authority . While pacemakers are allowed , it is considered unfair to provide additional assistance , for instance manoeuvring a horse to ensure a clear run for a stable companion . O 'Brien defended himself \" fervently \" , calling the charges \" fantasy ... a load of nonsense . \" = = = = Autumn = = = = It was expected that Duke of Marmalade would meet New Approach again in the Irish Champion Stakes in September , but following heavy rain in the build-up to the race O 'Brien withdrew the colt , saying \" we don 't want to subject him to soft ground now , with the rest of the year in mind . \" Duke of Marmalade did not appear again until the Prix de l 'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October , for which he was made 4 / 1 second favourite despite O 'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground . He was settled on the outside , but when Murtagh attempted to have him move forward in the straight , he made no progress and finished seventh of the sixteen runners behind Zarkava . On his final start , he was sent to California for the Breeders ' Cup Classic at Santa Anita . Racing on a synthetic track for the first time , he ran in third place for much of the distance and briefly headed the field turning into the straight , but faded in the closing stages to finish ninth of the twelve runners behind Raven 's Pass . Murtagh and O 'Brien characterised the performance as typifying \" the end of a long , hard season \" and Duke of Marmalade 's retirement was announced immediately . = = Race record = = . = = Assessment , honours and awards = = In November 2008 , Duke of Marmalade was named European Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards . In the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings for 2007 , Duke of Marmalade was assessed on a mark of 120 , placing him just outside the world 's top thirty horses . In the 2008 Rankings , he was rated the fifth best horse in the world with a mark of 127 Duke of Marmalade was given an end of year rating of 132 by Timeform in 2008 . A rating of 130 or above is regarded as the mark of a real \" top-notcher . \" = = Stud career = = He was retired from racing at the end of 2008 and stood as a stallion for Coolmore Stud where he used to shuttle between their main base in County Tipperary , Ireland during the Northern Hemisphere breeding season and Coolmore 's Australian stud farm in the Hunter Region , New South Wales , during the Southern Hemisphere breeding season . His first foals were born in 2010 . In 2014 he relocated to Drakenstein Stud in South Africa where his first South African foals were born in 2015 . His offspring have included Group 1 winners Nutan ( Deutsches Derby ) , Star of Seville ( Prix de Diane ) and Simple Verse , as well as G2 winners Big Orange , Big Memory and Italian 1000 Guineas winner Sound of Freedom . On 10 November 2015 , Simple Verse was named Cartier Champion Stayer at the 25th edition of the Cartier Racing Awards . = = Pedigree = = Like all of Danehill 's offspring Duke of Marmalade is inbred 4x4 to the mare Natalma .

                    "text": "Parson Russell Terrier = The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century . The breed is named after the person credited with the creation of this type of dog , the Reverend John \" Jack \" Russell . It is the recognised conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Russell Terrier . In America , it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997 . The name was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name . A mostly white breed with either a smooth , rough or broken coat , it conforms to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell . It is a feisty , energetic terrier , suited to sports and able to get along with children and other animals . It has a range of breed-related health issues , mainly relating to eye disorders . = = History = = This breed shares a common history with the Jack Russell Terrier until the early 1980s . This type of small white terrier dates back to the work of the Reverend John Russell , born in 1795 . In 1819 he purchased a small white and tan female terrier named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford . She formed the basis for his breeding program , and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier . In 1894 , the Devon and Somerset Badger Club was founded by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed standard for this type of terrier . The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging , rather than fox hunting . By the turn of the 20th century , the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier . The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded . The Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain was established in 1974 as the parent club for the Jack Russell Terrier in the UK . The club has actively opposed recognition of the Jack Russell Terrier by Kennel Club ( UK ) . In 1983 , the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club ( PJRTC ) was reformed with the aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed . The initial application was turned down , but after several further rejections , the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier , with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991 . The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997 . On 1 August 1999 , the PJRTC successfully petitioned the Kennel Club ( UK ) to change the name of the breed to the Parson Russell Terrier , with the name of the breed club following suit . The international kennel association , the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale , recognised the Parson Russell Terrier on 4 June 2001 . The American Kennel Club updated the name of the recognised breed from Jack Russell Terrier on 1 April 2003 . The United Kennel Club adopted the new name on 23 April 2008 . The Australian National Kennel Council ( ANKC ) , New Zealand Kennel Club and United Kennel Club ( UKC ) are the only three major kennel clubs to recognise both the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier separately . In 2009 , there were 18 Parsons registered with the ANKC compared to 1073 Jack Russells . = = Description = = The Parson Russell Terrier is bred to conform to a conformation show standard . Unlike its close relative , the Jack Russell Terrier , Parson Russell Terriers have noticeably longer legs that are about as tall as the length of the Terrier 's body . It is a predominantly white breed with black , tan or tricolour markings and an easy to groom coat which is either smooth or broken ( similar to a smooth coat , but with some longer hair on the head , face , legs or body ) . The breed standard does not recognise a Parson Russell with a curly or rough coat . There is a clear outline with only a hint of eyebrows and beard should the dog be broken coated . They possess moderately thick small \" V \" shaped drop ears with the tip pointed towards the eyes . The nose of the dog should be black . The normal range of sizes is between 13 \u2013 14 inches ( 33 \u2013 36 cm ) tall at the withers , with a weight around 13 \u2013 17 pounds ( 5.9 \u2013 7.7 kg ) . The Parson Russell has a relatively square outline , with a body about as long as the dog is tall . Compared to the Jack Russell Terrier , the Parson Russell has a longer head and a larger chest along with overall a slightly larger body size . The Parson retains the flat skull but not the elongated shape of the Fox Terrier , and with lower set ears . In addition , the Jack Russell Terrier has a greater variation in size , ranging between 10 \u2013 15 inches ( 25 \u2013 38 cm ) in height at the withers . Two hands should be able to span the chest of the dog behind its elbows , with the thumbs at the withers . This is required in show judging , with the judge lifting the dog 's front legs gently off the ground in this motion in order to measure the size of the chest . The judges fingers should meet under the chest and the thumbs on top of the spine . The American Kennel Club describes this as a \" significant factor and a critical part of the judging process . \" It is not done to measure the size of the chest , but rather to feel for the correct shape . Under the show standard , there are several physical points which would be treated as faults in the show ring . These are for the height of the dog at the withers to be outside of the standard range , or for the dog to possess either pricked up ears , a liver or brown coloured nose , an overshot or undershot jawline or to have brindle markings . = = Temperament = = The Parson is a feisty and energetic type of Terrier . They can excel in dog sports such as flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise in order to prevent them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home . They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament , they will not tolerate rough handling . The AKC describes them as being single minded , tenacious and courageous when at work , while at home they can be exuberant , playful and affectionate . However , it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work , such as fox hunting , typical of a small white terrier , as they are more adapted to the show bench . They can be playful with other dogs , and get along with horses . The breed standard requires that shyness be treated as a fault , although it states that this should not be confused with submissiveness which is not treated as such . Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring . = = Health = = Eye conditions which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation , a heritable condition . This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal and begin to disintegrate in affected dogs . The fibres support the lens of the eye , and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye . If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur , causing loss of vision . National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club ( UK ) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers , broken down into three groups ; clears , carriers , and affecteds . Other eye conditions which appear in the breed include cataracts in juveniles , corneal dystrophy , progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment . Non-eye breed related conditions which may affect a Parson are deafness and patella luxation . The average lifespan of a Parson Russell Terrier is between 14 and 15 years .",

                    "text": "D\u00f8lehest = The Dole Gudbrandsdal , D\u00f8lahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway . The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed ; it is also considered a part of the Coldblood trotter type . The Dole Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse , known for its pulling power and agility , while the Dole Trotter is a smaller , faster horse used for harness racing ; the two types are commonly interbred . Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the studbook , which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type . The Dole is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley , and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse . Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred , Arabian and other blood added in , especially during the creation of the Dole Trotter in the 19th century . The first studbook was created in 1941 , and the current breed association formed in 1947 . Although originally used mainly as a pack horse , today the heavier Dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes . The Dole Gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding . = = Breed characteristics = = The Dole horses generally stand 14.1 to 15.3 hands ( 57 to 63 inches , 145 to 160 cm ) hands high , weigh 1,190 to 1,390 pounds ( 540 to 630 kg ) , and are usually bay , brown or black , with gray , palomino , chestnut and dun occurring less frequently . White markings may occur on the head and legs , especially on the trotter type . The head is heavy with a straight profile , the neck rather short and muscular , the withers moderately pronounced and broad , the chest wide and deep , and the shoulder strong , muscular and sloping . The back is long and the croup broad , muscular and slightly sloping . The legs are short but sturdy and well-muscled , with broad , solid joints and tough hooves . At one point in the breed 's history it was prone to weak legs and low fertility , but these problems have since been corrected . Dole horses closely resemble the British Fell and Dales ponies , which developed from the same ancestral stock . When presented for grading and studbook inspection , the heavy-type Dole Gudbrandsdals are tested for pulling power and trotting . In the lighter type , x-rays showing the knee and lower legs to be free of defects must be presented , and stallions must have satisfactory results on the track before they may be used for breeding . However , three-year-old stallions may be issued temporary licenses before they begin their racing career if their conformation , breeding , and trotting ability are considered acceptable . Trotting-type mares with proper conformation that are not fast enough during grading may be registered as draft-type Doles . These strict and organized standards have improved the quality of the Dole breed over the past few decades . Although the Dole horse is one of the smallest draft breeds , it shows great pulling power , and is also hardy and agile . They are especially known for their excellent trots , as is shown by the lighter sub-type of the breed . During the late 20th century , interbreeding between the two types became quite common ; due to this , the breed became much more uniform in type , with fewer differences between the trotter and draft sections . = = Breed history = = The Dole is thought to have originated in the Gudbrandsdal , an inland valley in the county of Oppland . It is likely that the Dole is in part a descendant of the Friesian , as the two breeds are similar in conformation , and the Frisian people were known traders in the area between 400 and 800 AD . There was also equine movement between western Norway and northern England during the 9th century through the mid-11th century ; this extended period of trade between these areas likely influenced the strong resemblance between the Dole , Friesian , Fell Pony and Dale Pony breeds . Two stallions , named Odin and Mazarin , had a large influence on the development of the Dole breed . Odin ( son of Partisan ) , was a stallion of Thoroughbred ( some sources say Norfolk Trotter ) breeding , imported to Norway in 1834 . Odin was said to cost \u20a4 257 at the time and to have been bred to over 100 mares in his first four years in Norway . All Dole Trotter horses today contain Odin bloodlines . Mazarin was an Arabian imported to Norway in 1934 . In 1849 , another influential stallion was foaled , named Veikle Balder 4 ; he was a grandson of Odin and is considered the foundation stallion of the heavier Dole type . A stallion named Brimen 825 was used by breeders to maintain and improve some horses of the heavier Dole type for draft uses . In the 19th century , harness racing began to rise in popularity in Norway and breeders looked to create a horse suitable for that sport . The Dole Trotter , a smaller , lighter , faster variation of the draft-type Dole Gudbrandsdal , was then developed . Infusions of Thoroughbred blood , as well as that of various trotting and heavy draft breeds , was used to create this new type . The Dole Trotter was especially influenced between 1840 and 1860 by two other stallions , Toftebrun and Dovre ( an Arabian ) ; the latter is the foundation stallion of the Dole Trotter type . The two types are commonly interbred , especially since 1960 . In 1872 , the Dole Gudbrandsdal was split into two types - a class for heavier agriculture and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses . In 1875 , the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type . In 1902 , the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published , containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892 . In 1903 , the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses . At the same time , standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created . In 1965 , the Norwegian or Dole Trotter studbook was taken over by the Norwegian Trotting Association , as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture . The Dole Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry , and horses have to meet many of the same standards . The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed . Interest in the Dole Gudbrandsdal continued through World War II , and the horses were used heavily during Norway 's occupation by Germany . Breed numbers and interest diminished after the war as increasing mechanization reduced demand for draft animals ; however , a breeding center was established in 1962 to help maintain population numbers . In 1947 , the National D\u00f8lehorse Association was formed to promote and preserve the breed . As of 2002 , there are approximately 4,000 registered Dole Gudbrandsdals , with around 175 new foals registered annually . = = Uses = = When originally developed , Dole Gudbrandsdals were used as pack horses on overland trade routes across Norway , the main one of which connected Oslo with the North Sea and ran through the Gudbrandsdal Valley . The Dole Gudbrandsdal is used mainly for heavy draft and agricultural work , as well as timber hauling , while the lighter Dole Trotter is used mainly for harness racing . The Dole Gudbrandsdal was an influential breed in the formation of the North Swedish Horse , and the two breeds are very similar in conformation . When the Dole and North Swedish breeds are crossed , they produce a lighter-weight horse with more forward gaits that is often used for harness racing . The Dole Gudbrandsdal has also been crossed with Swedish Warmbloods to produce riding-type horses , and it has been theorized that Dole / Thoroughbred crosses may produce nice hunter horses .",

                    "text": "Clydesdale horse = The Clydesdale is a breed of draught horse derived from the farm horses of Clydesdale , Scotland , and named after that region . Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses , it is now a tall breed . Often bay in color , they show significant white markings due to the presence of sabino genetics . The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage , and is still used for draught purposes today . The Budweiser Clydesdales are some of the most famous Clydesdales , and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British Household Cavalry . They have also been used to create and improve other draught breeds . The breed was developed from Flemish stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares . The first recorded use of the name \" Clydesdale \" for the breed was in 1826 , and by 1830 a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England . The first breed registry was formed in 1877 . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world , including to Australia and New Zealand , where they became known as \" the breed that built Australia \" . However , during World War I population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanization and war conscription . This decline continued , and by the 1970s , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considered the breed vulnerable to extinction . Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening time , but they are still thought to be vulnerable . = = Breed characteristics = = The conformation of the Clydesdale has changed greatly throughout its history . In the 1920s and 1930s , it was a compact horse smaller than the Shire , Percheron , and Belgian . Beginning in the 1940s , breeding animals were selected to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows . Today , the Clydesdale stands 16 to 18 hands ( 64 to 72 inches , 163 to 183 cm ) high and weighs 1,800 to 2,000 pounds ( 820 to 910 kg ) . Some mature males are larger , standing taller than 18 hands and weighing up to 2,200 pounds ( 1,000 kg ) . The breed has a straight or slightly convex facial profile , broad forehead and wide muzzle . It is well muscled and strong , with an arched neck , high withers , and a sloped shoulder . Breed associations pay close attention to the quality of the hooves and legs , as well as the general movement . Their gaits are active , with clearly lifted hooves and a general impression of power and quality . Clydesdales are energetic , with a manner described by the Clydesdale Horse Society as a \" gaiety of carriage and outlook \" . Clydesdales have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema , a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling , hyperkeratosis , and fibrosis of distal limbs that is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans . Clydesdales are usually bay in colour , but roan , black , grey , and chestnut also occur . Most have white markings , including white on the face , feet , legs and occasional body spotting ( generally on the lower belly ) . They also have extensive feathering on their lower legs . Roaning , body spotting and extensive white markings are thought to be the result of sabino genetics . Some Clydesdale breeders want white face and leg markings without the spotting on the body . To attempt getting the ideal set of markings , they often breed horses with only one white leg to horses with four white legs and sabino roaning on their bodies . On average , the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings . Clydesdales do not have the SB1 ( Sabino 1 ) gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds , and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns . Many buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses , especially those with four white legs and white facial markings . Specific colours are often preferred over other physical traits , and some buyers even choose horses with soundness problems if they have the desired colour and markings . Roan horses are not preferred by buyers , despite one draught-breed writer theorizing that they are needed to keep the desired coat colours and texture . Breed associations , however , state that no colours are bad , and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted . = = History = = The Clydesdale takes its name from Clydesdale , the old name for Lanarkshire , noted for the River Clyde . In the mid-18th century , Flemish stallions were imported to Scotland and bred to local mares , resulting in foals that were larger than the existing local stock . These included a black unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of Lochlyloch and an unnamed dark-brown stallion owned by the Duke of Hamilton . Another prominent stallion was a 16.1 hands ( 65 inches , 165 cm ) coach horse stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze . Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early 19th century , and in 1806 a filly , later known as \" Lampits mare \" after the farm name of her owner , was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion . This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today . One of her foals was Thompson 's Black Horse ( known as Glancer ) , who was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed . The first recorded use of the name \" Clydesdale \" in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in Glasgow . Another theory of their origin , that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century , was also promulgated in the late 18th century . However , even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely . A system of hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland , with written records dating back to 1837 . This program consisted of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion , whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize . The owner was then required , in return for additional monies , to take the stallion throughout a designated area , breeding to the local mares . Through this system and by purchase , Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England . Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares , these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed , and by 1840 , Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same . In 1877 , the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed , followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association ( later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA ) , which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts . The first American stud book was published in 1882 . In 1883 , the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded to compete with the Clydesdale Horse Society . It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed , who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale . Large numbers of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , with 1,617 stallions leaving the country in 1911 alone . Between 1884 and 1945 , export certificates were issued for 20,183 horses . These horses were exported to other countries in the British Empire , as well as North and South America , continental Europe and Russia . World War I saw the conscription of thousands of horses for the war effort , and after the war breed numbers declined as farms became increasingly mechanised . This decline continued between the wars . Following World War II the number of Clydesdale breeding stallions in England dropped from more than 200 in 1946 to 80 in 1949 . By 1975 , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considered them vulnerable to extinction , meaning there were fewer than 900 breeding females in the UK . Many of the horses exported from Scotland in the 19th and 20th centuries went to Australia and New Zealand . In 1918 , the Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society was formed as the association for the breed in Australia . Between 1906 and 1936 , Clydesdales were bred so extensively in Australia that other draught breeds were almost unknown . By the late 1960s it was noted that \" Excellent Clydesdale horses are bred in Victoria and New Zealand ; but , at least in the former place , it is considered advisable to keep up the type by frequent importations from England . \" Over 25,000 Clydesdales were registered in Australia between 1924 and 2008 . The popularity of the Clydesdale led to it being called \" the breed that built Australia \" . In the 1990s , the breed 's popularity and numbers began to rise . By 2005 , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust had moved the breed to \" at risk \" status , meaning there were fewer than 1,500 breeding females in the UK . However , by 2010 they had been moved back to vulnerable . The Clydesdale is considered to be at \" watch \" status by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , meaning that as of 2010 fewer than 2,500 horses are registered annually in the USA and fewer than 10,000 exist worldwide . As of 2010 , there are estimated to be around 5,000 Clydesdales worldwide , with around 4,000 in the US and Canada , 800 in the UK and the rest in other countries , including Russia , Japan , Germany and South Africa . = = Uses = = The Clydesdale was originally used for agriculture , hauling coal in Lanarkshire and heavy hauling in Glasgow . Today , Clydesdales are still used for draught purposes , including agriculture , logging and driving . They are also shown and ridden , as well as kept for pleasure . Some of the most famous members of the breed are the teams that make up the hitches of the Budweiser Clydesdales . These horses were first owned by the Budweiser Brewery at the end of Prohibition in the United States , and have since become an international symbol of both the breed and the brand . The Budweiser breeding program , with its strict standards of colour and conformation , have influenced the look of the breed in the United States to the point that many people believe that Clydesdales are always bay with white markings . As well as being driven , some Clydesdales are used for riding and can be shown under saddle . Clydesdales and Shires are used by the British Household Cavalry as drum horses , leading parades on ceremonial and state occasions . The horses are eye-catching colours , including piebald , skewbald and roan . To be used for this purpose , a drum horse must stand a minimum of 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) high . They carry the Musical Ride Officer and two silver drums weighing 56 kilograms ( 123 lb ) each . In the late 19th century , Clydesdale blood was added to the Irish draught breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed . However , these efforts were not seen as successful , as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults . The Clydesdale was instrumental in the creation of the Gypsy Vanner horse , developed in Great Britain . The Clydesdale , along with other draught breeds , was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse . In the early 20th century , they were often crossed with Dales ponies , creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery .",

                    "text": "Kaimanawa horse = Kaimanawa horses are a population of feral horses in New Zealand that are descended from domestic horses released in the 19th and 20th centuries . They are known for their hardiness and quiet temperament . The New Zealand government strictly controls the population to protect the habitat in which they live , which includes several endangered species of plants . The varying heritage gives the breed a wide range of heights , body patterns and colours . They are usually well-muscled , sure-footed and tough . Horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876 , although the first horses had been brought into New Zealand in 1814 . The feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases . Members of the herd were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses , as well as being caught for their meat , hair and hides . The herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges , and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979 . The Kaimanawa herd was protected by the New Zealand government in 1981 , and there were 1,576 horses in the herd by 1994 . A small , mostly unmanaged population also exists on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island . Roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size of the herd , removing around 2,800 horses altogether . The Kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the United Nations ' Food and Agricultural Organization , and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed . = = History = = The first horses were introduced to New Zealand by Protestant missionary Reverend Samuel Marsden in December 1814 , and wild horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in central North Island of New Zealand in 1876 . The Kaimanawa breed descended from domestic horses that were released in the late 19th century and early 20th century in the middle of the North Island around the Kaimanawa mountains . Between 1858 and 1875 , Major George Gwavas Carlyon imported Exmoor ponies to Hawkes Bay and crossed them with local stock to produce the Carlyon pony . These Carlyon ponies were later crossed with two Welsh stallions , Kinarth Caesar and Comet , imported by Sir Donald McLean , and a breed known as the Comet resulted . At some point during the 1870s , McLean released a Comet stallion and several mares on the Kaingaroa Plains and the bloodline apparently became part of the wild Kaimanawa population . Other horses were added to the bloodline through escapes and releases from local sheep stations and from cavalry units at Waiouru that were threatened with a strangles epidemic . It is also thought that in the 1960s Nicholas Koreneff released an Arabian stallion into the Argo Valley region . Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , horses were harvested from the feral herds and used as riding and stock horses , as well as being used for their meat , hair and hides . Originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the British Crown and the native M\u0101ori , but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses . Kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the Thoroughbred and other Thoroughbred cross breeds . Pressure from land development and an encroaching human population reduced the range and the number of the Kaimanawa horses , and in 1979 it was found that only about 174 horses remained . Starting in 1981 , the Kaimanawa population , range size , and herd movements began to be officially measured , and a protected area was formed for the breed in the Waiouru Military Training Area . Legislative protection was similar to the kiwi and other native species . There was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed , and 1,576 horses were known to exist in the area by 1994 . There is also a small population of horses on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island , which is mostly unmanaged by the New Zealand government . In 2008 , the Kaimanawa herds were the focus of a novel called Kaimanawa Princess , by Dianne Haworth . = = Breed characteristics = = Many characteristics of the Comet type are said to be shown in the Kaimanawa horses today , although the varied gene input has produced a wide range of sizes , colours , and body types among the wild horses . The Kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance , with heights ranging between 12.2 and 15 hands ( 50 and 60 inches , 127 and 152 cm ) high . Any coat colour or pattern marking is acceptable . They are usually well-muscled . Their feral way of life has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little , and they are usually sure-footed and tough . They have a medium-sized head in good proportion to their body , with wide variation in shape due to the different conformation of their ancestors . Kaimanawa horses have a short , deep neck with a thick throat area , straight shoulders , a deep girth , and a short to medium back . The hindquarters vary from sloping to well-rounded . The legs are long and well-muscled , with strong hooves , and hind hooves that are generally smaller than the front ones . All horses are considered to age a year on the first of August , regardless of their actual foaling date . = = Population control and study = = Due to the increase in population after protective legislation was put into place , the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990 . A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991 , and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters , and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd . However , core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option . Trial musters were conducted in 1993 , 1994 and 1995 , and were successful , although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses . In 1994 , a working party was established to look at the management of the Kaimanawa herd . They aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management , to ensure that the treatment of horses is humane , to preserve and control the best attributes of the herds , and to eliminate the impacts of the herds on other conservation priorities . Goals included ensuring the welfare of the horses , protecting natural ecosystems and features that the Kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping the herd at a sustainable level . Ecological objectives included ensuring that Kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered , rare and biogeographically significant plants ; ensuring that the herd does not further degrade the ecosystems in which it lives ; and preventing the herd from spreading into the Kaimanawa Forest Park and the Tongariro National Park . Herd objectives included ensuring that the public was safe from roaming horses , while still allowing and improving public access to the herd and ensuring humane treatment of the horses ; reducing conflict between the herd and other ecological values and land uses ; and ensuring that the herd is contained to a population that is tolerated by the ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging . The Department of Conservation has since 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of Kaimanawas to keep the herd population around a target level of 500 horses . The target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009 . These horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes . A main reason for the strict population control is to protect the habitat in which they live . This habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered , which the Kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing . These plants include herbs , grasses , sedges , flowers and mistletoes ; among these are Deschampsia caespitosa ( a very rare tussock grass ) , Peraxilla tetrapetala ( a vulnerable mistletoe ) and Libertia peregrinans ( a possibly locally extinct sand iris ) . The 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd , the largest culling since the beginning of the program , with homes found for 85 % of the horses removed . Conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public , and between 1990 and 2003 the New Zealand Minister for Conservation received more public comments on the Kaimanawa horse than on any other subject . In this period , more than 1,400 requests for information and letters were received , with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997 . This was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996 ; due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997 . In 1997 , around 1,069 horses were removed from the range and adopted , reducing the main herd to around 500 , and reducing their range to around 25,000 ha from around 70,000 . Since 1993 , a total of around 2,800 horses have been removed from the range . Only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred . The United Nations ' Food and Agricultural Organization lists the Kaimanawa horses as a herd of special genetic value that can be compared with other groups of feral horses such as New Forest ponies , Assateague ponies , wild Mustangs , and with free-living zebras . Kaimanawas are of special value because of their low rate of interaction with humans . This lack of interaction may result in a herd with more wild and fewer domestic characteristics , which is of special interest to researchers . Between 1994 and 1997 , students from Massey University studied a population of around 400 Kaimanawa horses to learn their habits and herd dynamics . A 2000 study found that although sometimes there are more than two stallions in Kaimanawa horse herds , only the two stallions highest in the herd hierarchy mate with the herd females . This differs from other feral horse herds , some of which have only one stallion that mates with mares , while others have several stallions that sire foals .",

                    "text": "Picardy Spaniel = The Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog . It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel , and still has many similarities , but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds . It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility , remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain . However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century . Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins , it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears , it can be prone to ear infections . = = History = = The French Spaniel and the Picardy Spaniel are considered to be the two oldest continental breeds of spaniel . Both breeds are speculated to have stemmed from the Chien d ' Oysel described in the writings of Gaston Phoebus . Hunting during this period in France was one of the favourite sports of the nobility and the French type of Spaniel became the favourite hunting dog of the French Royalty . The breed can be seen in paintings dating from this period by artists Alexandre-Fran\u00e7ois Desportes and Jean-Baptiste Oudry . They were also the first breed of dog to be admitted into salons . The breed became more popular still following the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting was no longer restricted to the nobility . Although spread throughout France , a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions . During the early 19th century , British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France . The British brought their own hunting dogs , and this resulted in a change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel . In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel . = = = Recognition = = = The Epagneul Picard Club was formed in 1921 and was merged with the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel on 28 July 1937 . A further merger took place on 21 May 1980 when these clubs merged with the Pont-Audemer Club to form the Club des Epagneuls Picards , Bleus de Picardie & Pont Audemer . The Picardy Spaniel is recognised by a variety of Kennel Clubs and associations including the North American Kennel Club , American Rare Breed Association , United Kennel Club , and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale . All four associations use the standard as set by the FCI . It is also recognised by the Continental Kennel Club , but unlike the closely related Blue Picardy Spaniel , it is not recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club . = = Description = = = = = Appearance = = = Typical examples of the breed measure between 22 \u2013 24 inches ( 56 \u2013 61 cm ) at the withers , with the average weight between 20 \u2013 25 kilograms ( 44 \u2013 55 lb ) . The breed is similar in size to the English Setter , although is slightly smaller . Of the Spaniel type breeds , only the Large M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder and Drentse Patrijshond are recognised as possibly growing to larger sizes , with the Drentse measuring 21.5 \u2013 25.5 in ( 55 \u2013 65 cm ) , and the M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder slightly smaller with a narrower range at 23 \u2013 25 in ( 58 \u2013 64 cm ) . The breed has a squarely built muscular body and an oval shaped head with a long muzzle and long ears that hang fairly low . Its coat can vary in colours from chocolate , chestnut brown and white with sandy coloured markings on the head and white or grey spots on the legs . Its hair is abundant with a slight wave , enabling it to work in dense cover and even in water . = = = Temperament = = = The Picardy Spaniel is a docile breed of dog and is fond of playing with children and bonds well with their master . It is described as having a gentle sociable nature , possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train . In France , the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants , and in swamps for Snipes . However it can also be used for hunting ducks , hares and rabbits . The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water . It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required . The dog is content with a small amount of space and could suit life in the city , but also loves open spaces . = = Health = = The Picardy Spaniel has no known hereditary health problems , and has an average lifespan of 14 years . However being a hunting spaniel , the breed is prone to ear infections . These infections are common among dogs with pendulous ears , including Basset Hounds and other breeds of spaniel . Overfeeding a Picardy Spaniel may lead to overweight .",

                    "text": "Large Black pig = The Large Black , occasionally called the Devon , Cornwall Black or Boggu , is a breed of domestic pig native to Great Britain , particularly Devon , Cornwall and Essex . The Large Black is accurately named , as it is a large swine breed and is the only British pig that is entirely black . It is a hardy and docile pig , with Large Black sows known for having large litters . The breed 's foraging ability make it particularly useful for extensive farming , while a poor candidate for intensive farming . The Large Black combined local black pig breeds from the West Country and the East of England . With the founding of a breed association in 1898 or 1899 , variations between the types from the two areas decreased . The Large Black was popular in the early 1900s and was exported to many areas of the world . Population numbers declined after the Second World War as farmers turned to breeds more suitable to intensive pig farming , and by the 1960s the breed was almost extinct . Numbers have slowly risen , but it is still considered vulnerable by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust , the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , and Rare Breeds Canada . = = History = = The Large Black resulted from the amalgamation of black pigs from two geographically separate areas , Devon and Cornwall in the south-west of England , and Essex , Suffolk and Kent in the east . The pigs from eastern England , mainly Essex , were influenced by importations from China in the late 18th century , while those from Devon and Cornwall were probably more closely related to the pigs in mainland Europe , particularly France . The Devon pigs were originally selected for \" the length of their bodies , ears , noses , tail and hair , the longer the better , without reference to quality or substance \" , but selective breeding brought improvements to the breed , and by 1850 the type was small-boned and thick-bodied , with good conformation and constitution . Alternative origins proposed for the black colour of the breed are black Guinea hogs imported from Africa ( similar to the Guinea Hog of the US ) or from Neapolitan pigs . During the late 19th century , the Large Black grew in popularity . A breed association , the Large Black Pig Society , was formed in 1898 or 1899 , in Ipswich , Suffolk . A trademark , consisting of the letters LBP within a shield , was registered in 1902 . The Herd Book of Large Black Pigs was first published in 1899 . In it the large black pigs of Devon and Cornwall were combined under one name with the remnants of the smaller Black Essex , Black Suffolk or Small Black , and other black East Anglian breeds whose numbers had fallen below sustainable levels . There were considerable variations between the types in the two areas , but breeding stock was exchanged between them and by 1913 \" general uniformity \" had been achieved . = = = 1920s to modern times = = = In 1919 a Large Black sow was Supreme Champion at Smithfield , and at the Royal Show that year 121 Large Blacks were entered , more than any other breed . Popularity of the breed peaked in the 1920s , however , and after World War II , population numbers declined as farmers began to favour pig breeds that would do well in intensive indoor farming . The breed association was merged with the National Pig Breeders Association ( later the British Pig Association ) in 1949 . In 1955 the Howitt report on the development of pig production in the United Kingdom was published . Its main conclusions were that UK pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers , that the diversity of local breeds in the UK was an obstacle to progress , and that British pig farmers should focus on three breeds only : the Welsh , the British Landrace , and the Large White . The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig breeds , including the Large Black . By the time the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was founded 1973 , numbers of all traditional pig breeds were dangerously low , and many of them were extinct . The Large Black was placed on the Trust 's endangered list . = = = In other countries = = = By 1913 , Large Black had by then spread throughout most of Britain , and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America , Africa and Oceania . The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903 , with the Large Black being chosen over the Berkshire pig because of their ability to thrive in hot weather , their foraging abilities and their fecundity . By 1930 , Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population , and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania . The breed population continued to hover around 1 percent of the total population , with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s . The first exports to the US were in the 1920s , but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985 . Today , small herds can be found in the US that descend from the pigs imported in 1985 and 1990 , and there are also herds in Canada , Australia , and South Africa . = = Characteristics = = The Large Black is a long , deep-bodied pig , well known for its hardiness and suitability for extensive farming . Large Blacks are best suited for pasture-based farming due to their strong foraging and grazing ability , which efficiently converts poor quality feed into meat . It is the only pig breed in Britain to be all black , and this helps protect the pig from sunburn in sunny climates . Temperamentally , the Large Black is a very docile breed which is easily contained by fencing . This is partly because its large , drooping ears obscure its vision , although they also help to protect the face and eyes while the animal is foraging , especially when rooting in dirt . The breed is also known for its long periods of fertility and strong maternal instincts . Sows give birth to a large litter of 8 \u2013 10 piglets , but some sows have been known to have litters of up to 13 piglets . Also of note is the Large Black sow listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having produced 26 litters between 1940 and 1952 \u2013 the largest number of litters ever recorded for a pig . Boars weigh 700 to 800 pounds ( 320 to 360 kg ) and sows around 600 to 700 pounds ( 270 to 320 kg ) , although obesity in sows sometimes results in cystic ovaries and a loss of fertility . The breed has become larger over the years ; in the early 1900s , weights averaged 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) for sows and larger for boars . At its peak of popularity , the Large Black was used mainly for meat production , especially bacon . The meat from the Large Black is known for its lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat , but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs , producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers . However , today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred Large Black . = = Conservation status = = In 1954 there were 2195 Large Black pigs recorded , 269 licensed boars and 1926 registered sows , representing approximately 3.4 % of the UK pig population of about 65,000 . At the end of 2011 there were 421 Large Black pigs ( 86 boars and 335 sows ) registered , a small increase over the 2010 figure of 405 ( 65 boars , 340 sows ) . The Large Black is the rarest historic pig breed in Britain , although numbers are slowly on the rise due to an increase in demand for meat from traditional pig breeds . In 2011 it was classified as \" vulnerable \" on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust , meaning that there are believed to be between 200 and 300 breeding females . The British Pig Association currently recognizes 6 boar lines and 24 sow lines within the breed . In 2004 the Rare Breeds Trust of Australia listed the status of the Large Black as \" critical \" , meaning that sow registrations in the Australian Pure Bred Pig Herd Book of the Australian Pig Breeders Association were fewer than 30 per year . The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy estimated the Large Black population of the United States at 300 breeding hogs in 2008 , and lists its status as \" critical \" , which means that fewer than 200 animals are registered each year in the United States , and there are estimated to be fewer than 2,000 worldwide . The US population of Large Black pigs stood at around 300 as of 2008 . Besides conservation for the sake of genetic diversity in livestock , the breed is also coming to be seen as a good option for fulfilling the needs of an increasing number of consumers interested in pasture-raised pork . Rare Breeds Canada identified the single remaining Canadian herd in 1997 , and has since included the breed on its conservation watchlist as \" endangered \" , with fewer than 500 of the animals in that country .",

                    "text": "Bedlington Terrier = The Bedlington Terrier is a breed of small dog named after the mining town of Bedlington , Northumberland in North East England . Originally bred to hunt vermin in mines , the Bedlington Terrier has since been used in dog racing , numerous dog sports , as well as in conformation shows and as a companion dog . It is closely related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier , Whippet and Otterhound . It is described as a very versatile yet contradictory dog , being both good with children and \" fit to kill any other dog of his weight \" . They have powerful swimming skills , comparable to those of water dogs such as the Newfoundland , and are noted for being very quick and having high endurance . Bedlingtons are noted for their similarity in appearance to lambs . The dogs have blue , liver or sandy colouration , all three of which may have tan points . Their fur forms a distinctive top knot on the dog 's head . Originally known as the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier , the name Bedlington Terrier was not applied to the breed until 1825 , but some dogs have pedigrees that can be traced back as far as 1782 . The first dog shows with a class for Bedlington Terriers was held in 1870 at Bedlington . Bedlington Terriers shown at early shows were frequently dyed to improve the look of their fur . In 1948 , a Bedlington Terrier known as Rock Ridge Night Rocket won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show . The breed has a high instance of copper toxicosis , but with the exception of eye problems , it is mostly free from health complaints . = = Description = = = = = Appearance = = = The Bedlington Terrier has been described as resembling a lamb . It has also been compared to a miniature version of the Scottish Deerhound . George Shields stated that exceedingly well-bred dogs possess the spirit of a thoroughbred racehorse . The dogs have blue , liver or sandy colouration , all three of which may have tan points . Bedlingtons carry what is known as the greying gene , a dominant trait carried on the G locus . This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age . The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog 's head known as a topknot . Although most modern breed standards call for the dog 's topknot to be lighter than its body , when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder , Mr. Pickett , who believed that the topknot should be darker , not lighter . The dog 's coat has been described as shaggy , hard , and rugged in style and it has also been described as linty in texture , giving the breed the nickname of \" linty-haired terrier \" . Its coat is made up of a combination of hard and soft hairs . It is extremely difficult to maintain a \" show clip \" , even for professionals , and grooming can be quite expensive . Dogs in what is referred to as show clip , or groomed for the show ring , cannot have fur that stands out more than 1 inch ( 2.5 centimetres ) from their body , and the coat must have a \" crisp \" texture . If grooming is not performed regularly , the coat 's condition rapidly deteriorates . For that reason , most Bedlingtons that are kept strictly as pets keep a lower maintenance \" pet groom \" style . Bedlington Terriers have been referred to as a nonshedding hypoallergenic breed . The head of the dog must be rounded in shape with no stop . Their eyes are almond-shaped and small , and the lips are close-fitting and lack flews . The back must be arched , and the body should be slightly longer in length than in height . Although 16.5 inches ( 42 cm ) is the preferred height for male dogs , a range from 16 to 17.5 inches ( 41 to 44 cm ) is allowed ; for females , the preferred height is 15.5 inches ( 39 cm ) and the acceptable range is from 15 to 16.5 inches ( 38 to 42 cm ) . Both genders must weigh between 17 and 23 pounds ( 7.7 and 10.4 kg ) . They possess a light , springy gait . = = = Temperament = = = Bedlingtons are sharp and plucky . Their bark has been called hound-like and has been compared to the firing of a machine gun . Fast dogs with high endurance , the Bedlington Terrier is just as quick in water as it is on land , and their swimming speed rivals that of the Newfoundland . Bedlington Terriers \" have pace enough to keep up with the ordinary speed of a horse . \" Because of the Whippet in their lineage , they have a tendency to bolt . Their versatility has been praised , with some dogs willing to \" [ be ] a house-dog , a gun-dog , a rat-dog , a badger-dog , or , if needed , [ to ] bolt a fox ... \" They are also known for their intelligence and tenacity when it comes to taking on vermin . Bedlingtons are quite fond of fighting , and are prone to jealousy when around other dogs . One man stated that \" this dog was about fit to kill any other dog of his weight \" and compared him to the fighting dogs used in dog fighting . They have also been used in pit fighting . However , both the AKC and the ASPCA call the breed \" mild \" and \" gentle \" and recommends it as being good with children . PetFinder says the breed is soft in temperament , companionable , demonstrative , loyal , and a quiet housedog . Although the breed may chase small animals outside , it is accepting of them inside . Playful and cheerful , the breed can be high-strung and excitable , and is prone to being headstrong . The New Zealand Kennel Club warns against keeping them with dogs that have dominant personalities , \" as once challenged they are terrifying fighters , despite their gentle appearance \" , but otherwise the breed is good with other dogs . Some breeders , notably George Newcombe , have argued that the working ability and courage of the Bedlington terrier has declined since it began being bred for show . Poodle may have been introduced into the breed to make the coat easier to groom and maintain . George Newcombe of the Working Bedlington Terrier Club said that \" the pure [ Bedlington Terrier ] could no longer be considered a serious working breed \" and proceeded to cross his dogs with Lakeland Terriers in an attempt to bring back the Bedlington 's working qualities . = = History = = Bred in the village of Bedlington in Northumberland , the Bedlington Terrier has been described as \" the favourite companion of the northern miners \" . They were originally known as Rodbury Terriers , Rothbury Terriers , or \" Rothbury 's Lambs \" , because the Lord of Rothbury had taken a particular liking to the dogs . Before this , they were known as \" gypsy dogs \" , as gypsies and poachers used them to hunt . The first mention of the Bedlington terrier , or as it was then known , the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier , was in 1825 , most likely in The Life of James Allen , but some dogs ' pedigrees have been traced as far back as 1782 . James ' father , William , was much in demand as an otter hunter , and he kept Bedlington Terriers in order to help him hunt . They were also valued by their owners as rabbit coursing dogs and racing dogs , until the Whippet became more popular as a racing dog and a courser . The Bedlington Terrier name was first given to a dog named Young Piper , which was owned by a man named Joseph Ainsley . Ainsley 's Piper has been called \" the best of his race \" and \" had a reputation for great pluck and courage \" . Piper began working with badgers at eight months old , and carried on hunting other animals generally regarded as vermin until he was blind . Piper is also known for saving a child from a pig , keeping the animal at bay until help arrived . Piper died at fifteen . The first shows that had a class for the Bedlington Terrier were held in 1870 at Bedlington . The following year , there was a Bedlington Terrier class at a show held at Crystal Palace , where a red dog named Miner took first prize . Miner also won a show held at Birmingham . The Bedlington Terrier Club was established in 1875 . Many dogs in early shows were clipped and dyed to bring them closer to the breed standard and improve their chances of winning . It is unknown if the judges of the time were aware of this practice , or if they cared . The practice of trimming was eventually accepted by The Kennel Club , under the pretense that the trimming was being done to \" smarten a dog to show his shape and general contour . \" Bedlington Terriers are closely related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier . In fact , the Earl of Antrim once exhibited two terriers from the same litter , and one won shows as a Dandie Dinmont , while the other won shows as a Bedlington . Bedlington Terriers are also related to the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier . The shape of its back suggests that it may related to the Whippet and it may also be related to the otterhound . Bedlington Terriers have been crossed with Whippets to produce a Lurcher with \" extra guts , pep , [ and ] fire . \" In 1948 , Ch . Rock Ridge Night Rocket took best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and was subsequently featured in LIFE magazine . One of his descendants , Ch . Femars ' Cable Car , was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in the February 8 , 1960 edition . = = Health = = = = = Longevity = = = Median longevity of Bedlington Terriers , based on two recent UK surveys , is about 13.5 years , which is longer than for purebred dogs in general and longer than most breeds similar in size . The longest-lived of 48 deceased dogs in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey was 18.4 years . Leading causes of death among Bedlington Terriers in the UK were old age ( 23 % ) , urologic ( 15 % ) , and hepatic ( 12.5 % ) . The leading \" hepatic \" cause of death was copper toxicosis . Dogs that died of liver diseases usually died at a younger age than dogs dying of most other causes . Bedlington Terrier owners in the UK reported that the most common health issues among living dogs were reproductive , heart murmur , and eye problems such as epiphora , retinal dysplasia , and cataracts . Bedlingtons seem to be more prone to these eye diseases than other breeds . They also have a high incidence of kidney problems . Copper toxicosis occurred among about 5 % of living dogs . Inbreeding is a concern , as some dogs \" [ having ] been bred in and in to a damaging extent . \" Reputable breeders will conduct DNA testing of all litters and will not allow pups who carry the copper toxicosis gene to be bred , a practice which has significantly reduced the incidence of this disease in the breed . Excepting these problems , Bedlingtons are generally a very healthy breed . = = = Copper toxicosis = = = Copper toxicosis , also known as copper storage disease and copper overload syndrome , is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver . It is closely related to Wilson 's disease in humans . Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds . West Highland White Terriers , Skye Terriers , and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease . Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported , but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed . Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons , the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper . This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus . There are three varieties of the disease : the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder ; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs , causes death in two to three days , and is thought to be caused by stress ; and the Chronic Form , which is characterized by an extended period of time in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog . Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver , but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper .",

They were originally developed to be all-black show dogs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog . However , during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable to be used for field work . They are now considered to be a rare breed , and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club . Their fur is darker than other spaniels and have no undercoat . Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest . They can make good family dogs and are patient with children , but can require some sort of purpose , be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive . = = History = = The Field Spaniel was originally developed for the show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel . Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised ; one of the first breeders of the Field Spaniel , Thomas Jacobs , said of the origin ; \" Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed ; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type , and frequent missiles have at me and my dogs from behind the hedge . But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about ? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one ( if there ever was one ! ) has not been forthcoming . Like most sporting dogs , they are the result of different crosses . \" They were unpopular with sportsmen as the dark colours of the breed did not show up in hunting conditions , and the elongated and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover . The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett , the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show . Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels . Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel . In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel ; however , it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel with the exception of the head itself . The dog who is considered to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel is Ch . Obo , who was born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother . Obo 's son Ch . Obo II is considered to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel , who was described as being only ten inches high with quite a long body . By 1909 , the average weight of a Field Spaniel was 35 \u2013 45 pounds ( 16 \u2013 20 kg ) . Further mixing of the breed occurred with elements of the Basset Hound introduced . Various genetic health issues arose and action was taken in order to correct the problems within the breed . English Springer Spaniels were used to introduce healthier elements into the breed and resulted in the longer legged spaniel that we know today . Most of the modern breed can be traced to four dogs from the 1950s ; Colombina of Teffont , Elmbury Morwena of Rhiwlas , Gormac Teal , and Ronayne Regal . The Field Spaniel remains a rare breed , even in the UK . In 2009 , a total of 51 dogs were registered with The Kennel Club and has been in steady decline since 2000 . Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club , the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year , with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009 . This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone . In order to promote the breed , they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club . = = Description = = = = = Appearance = = = The standard size for a Field Spaniel is 17 \u2013 18 inches ( 43 \u2013 46 cm ) tall at the withers , and a weight of between 40 \u2013 55 pounds ( 18 \u2013 25 kg ) . This places it roughly between the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel in size . Its long , silky coat comes in solid colours of black , liver , or roan . Tan points , white markings on the throat and the chest can be ticked or the same colour as the rest of the body . They have a moderately long single coat with no undercoat . Feathering of the fur appears on the chest , belly , ears and on the back of the legs . The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur . Docked tails were often used in working dogs , as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult . = = = Temperament = = = The Field Spaniel can be a good family dog while it has a job to do . They are suitable for dog agility and hunting . Without some sort of purpose , the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief . However , they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family . When socialised , they are good with other dogs . They are generally docile and independent , and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels . Stanley Coren 's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence . = = Health = = There are a few ocular conditions to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition . These include cataracts , retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia . Hip dysplasia has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels . In a health survey conducted by the Kennel Club ( UK ) , the primary cause of death in Field Spaniels was cancer , with the second most frequent cause being old age . The median lifespan for the breed was found to be eleven years and eight months , which is five months higher than the median age for all dog breeds .",

McKathan in Florida . After completing basic training , Zayat 's adult son , Justin , selected Paynter , along with stablemate Bodemeister , to move on to the racing stable of trainer Bob Baffert . Paynter did not race as a two-year-old . = = Three-year-old season = = Paynter won his maiden race on February 18 , 2012 at Santa Anita Park . In an unusual move , he was taken directly from his maiden race to the Grade I Santa Anita Derby , where he had a troubled start and ran in sixth place before finishing fourth , 3 3 \u2044 4 lengths behind the winner . Viewed as not quite ready for the Triple Crown races , Paynter next ran in the Derby Trial , where , on a muddy track , he lost narrowly in the final furlong . In his first three races , he was ridden by Martin Garcia . His second win was in a 1 1 \u2044 16 mile allowance race on the undercard of the 2012 Preakness Stakes , when he was ridden by Mike Smith , who also rode Bodemeister in the Preakness later that day . Following Bodemeister 's second-place finish in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness , Paynter was entered into the Belmont with Smith as jockey . In the Belmont , Paynter led for most of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail , allowing winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck . Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race , and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun ; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race . Paynter 's biggest win and first graded stakes win came in his next race , the 1 1 \u2044 8 mile , $ 1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park Racetrack in July 2012 . Baffert 's assistant trainer , Jim Barnes , represented the stable at the race , as Baffert had cut back his schedule following a heart attack earlier in the year . Paynter went off as the even-money favorite . Ridden for the first time by jockey Rafael Bejarano , he followed the leader through the backstretch , then took the lead at the far turn , beating five other horses to win by 3 3 \u2044 4 lengths . His winning time was 1 : 48.87 , earning him a Beyer Speed Figure of 108 . The victory was also Baffert 's third win in a row at the Haskell and sixth Haskell win in his career . Paynter 's winnings of $ 600,000 put him close to a lifetime earnings figure of $ 1 million , at $ 952,224 , considered impressive for a three-year-old horse who did not race as a two-year-old . Paynter 's next race was scheduled to be the Travers Stakes on August 25 . With all three Triple Crown race winners for 2012 already retired from racing ( all due to injury ) , Paynter was considered a contender to become the 3-year-old Horse of the Year if he continued to win races . = = Illness and surgery = = On July 29 , 2012 , two days after his Haskell win , Paynter developed a fever , pneumonia , and diarrhea . He was hospitalized at the nearby Mid-Atlantic Equine Medical Center in New Jersey and then shipped on August 10 , 2012 to Belmont Park where he trained for several days . He was then shipped to Saratoga Race Course , home to the Travers Stakes , to recover further . However , he had no public workouts and missed the Travers . He was scheduled to be flown back to Baffert 's home stable in California on August 27 , but Paynter again developed a fever and diarrhea . He was sent to the Upstate Equine Medical Center in Schuylerville , NY where he was diagnosed with colitis , an inflammation of the colon . Paynter 's condition quickly deteriorated and was deemed life-threatening . Ahmed and Justin Zayat began to tweet regular updates on his condition to the public . His care was supervised by Dr. Laura Javsicas , an Equine Internal Medicine specialist . Her devotion to Paynter was admired by both Zayat and Baffert , who later said that Javsicas should receive a special Eclipse Award . In turn , Paynter , normally characterized as an \" aggressive \" horse , was very cooperative toward his caregivers and accepted treatment without causing problems . Paynter developed an infection at a catheter site and blood clots in his veins due to problems with his protein levels . He lost weight , and suffering from fever , colitis and diarrhea was given plasma and \" aggressive \" antibiotic treatment . The medical staff were also worried , because a systemic illness with intestinal inflammation , such as colitis , is a common precursor to laminitis , a painful inflammation of the internal structures of the hoof . The staff had been using cryotherapy on his lower legs as a precaution . Although his blood test results and protein levels began to stabilize , he nevertheless developed laminitis in three of his feet on September 4 , ten days after he arrived at the center . The veterinarians treating Paynter put casts on his lower legs to support his feet . Most experts believed that even if he survived his racing days were over , and the Zayat family feared that euthanasia would be necessary . After about three days , he seemed to be feeling better ; his blood work became normal and his diarrhea cleared up , but he still had low-grade fevers . Against the odds , his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae , and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet . Although the cryotherapy had not prevented laminitis , it might have kept it from becoming worse . On September 21 , the casts were removed from his legs . The laminitis treatment was successful and his feet were returning to normal , raising hopes that he could race again some day . Paynter developed an increasing fan base as people followed the Zayat family 's social media updates , drawing comparisons to the struggle of Barbaro a few years earlier . Both Ahmed and Justin Zayat sent out regular tweets and the hashtag # PowerUpPaynter was used to help organize updates to the public . Paynter received handmade posters from children and hundreds of get well cards . Because fevers and colitis were still a problem , Javsicas performed ultrasound and found a problem area in his colon , thus surgery was required . Paynter was very thin by this time , weighing less than 900 pounds , and surgery was considered high risk . On October 2 , he was shipped to the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine 's New Bolton Center ( where Barbaro had also been treated ) and saw Dr. Louise Southwood , a veterinary surgeon who specialized in equine intestinal medicine and colitis cases . The following morning , Paynter went into surgery and Southwood removed a 15-inch ( 380 mm ) growth \" full of puss [ sic ] and bacteria \" from his intestines . Southwood explained , \" we finally got to the bottom of why he was spiking the fever . \" Paynter came out of the surgery well and Zayat tweeted , \" Just think about the resilience of this guy . \" Baffert commented , \" I can 't believe this horse is still alive . \" Nine days later , a press release came out stating that Paynter was \" cleared of any lingering symptoms of both [ colitis and laminitis ] , \" and expected to fully recover . = = Rehabilitation and awards = = Following surgery , Paynter quickly started to regain his weight , putting on 35 pounds in the two weeks between his surgery and being sent to Fair Hill Training Center 's Equine Therapy program on October 15 for rehabilitation . Nonetheless , he arrived at Fair Hill weighing only 912 pounds . At Fair Hill , he started out with hand-walking and grazing , later being allowed short periods of exercise in a round pen . He had access to treatment in a horse-sized hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber , an underwater treadmill called an AquaPacer , equine massage therapy , electromagnetic therapy , and use of a cold saltwater spa . By November 15 , he was close to 1,000 pounds and was allowed free daily turnout in a paddock . His normal temperament returned as he began to buck and kick during turnout . He also developed a taste for red peppermint candies , strongly preferring them over green spearmint ones . On December 26 , Paynter was selected as the winner of the 2012 Secretariat Vox Populi Award . Penny Chenery , owner of Secretariat , for whom the award was named , said \" Paynter 's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations , making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year 's Vox Populi Award ... After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease , I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis . The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter \u2014 a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit . \" In January 2013 , Paynter 's survival and recovery was voted the \" Moment of the Year \" by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association ( NTRA ) in a field of 12 nominees , and the horse 's connections were given that honor at the annual Eclipse Awards . = = 2013 : Comeback = = On December 29 , 2012 , Paynter was shipped from Fair Hill back to California , where he resumed race training with Baffert . When he left Fair Hill he weighed 1022 pounds and was described as \" full of himself . \" Both Southwood and Javsicas believed that he could recover completely . While numerous horses recovering from colitis and abdominal surgery have been able to return to their previous levels of competition , Paynter 's successful recovery from laminitis was the biggest factor in his ability to resume racing . He began jogging on the track on January 5 , and had his first official workout on February 26 . On June 14 he was entered into a 7-furlong allowance race at Betfair Hollywood Park . Ahmed Zayat said , \" He has shown so much courage , so much tenacity . I just want to let the horse do the talking . \" Paynter carried 124 pounds , the co-highweight of the eight horses in the race . Bejarano returned as jockey . It was the horse 's first start on a synthetic surface . He started from starting post position two at odds of 2 \u2013 5 . Paynter led from the start , clocked the first quarter mile in : 22.68 and the half mile in : 45.67 . At six furlongs , he was 2 1 \u2044 2 lengths in front , running that distance in 1 : 06.56 , and continued to increase his lead over the other horses . He won by 4 1 \u2044 2 lengths , finishing in 1 : 21.86 , and earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 114 , the best of his career . Justin Zayat said , \u201c I thought I was winning the Kentucky Derby , \u201d and Baffert stated , \" He is just an incredible , phenomenal horse , I can 't believe he is back . He 's just a great horse ... He went from being 99 \u2013 1 to survive to 1 \u2013 9 to win ... I got emotional watching . It \u2019 s an amazing story . \" Paynter handled the race well and came out in good shape . Plans were made for Paynter to run additional races before the Breeders ' Cup Classic in the fall . His next race was the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar on July 27 , 2013 . Shortly after his arrival at Del Mar racetrack in early July , Paynter was profiled on TV , showing that his usual temperament was back to normal , as the camera showed him attempting to nip Baffert . Running for the first time on a different synthetic surface , Polytrack , in the grade 2 race , Paynter was the 3 \u2013 5 favorite , and at 122 pounds carried the most weight . After running close to the pace and taking the lead in the homestretch , he lost by a half-length to a late-running horse , Kettle Corn , at the finish . Jockey Bejarano believed the polytrack surface was a factor in his loss . \" He never seemed comfortable out there , I felt like I had plenty of horse , but he just wasn 't liking what he was doing ... he didn 't have enough at the end . \" Nonetheless , purse money for his placing put him over one million dollars in lifetime winnings . Paynter next went east to run in the Grade I Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on August 31 . Five of the horses in the initial seven-horse field , including Paynter , were previous Grade I stakes winners . Paynter drew post position 5 and was the second favorite at 3-1 odds on the morning line . However , following the scratch of a speed horse , the oddsmaker revised his figures to make front-running Paynter the 2-1 favorite . On race day , over a sloppy track , another horse , Mucho Macho Man , scratched and only five horses went to the post . Paynter had a bad start , hitting the left side of the starting gate . Although he ran second for part of the race , he finished last in the field . Justin Zayat said after the race , \" [ Paynter ] never got a hold of the track . We \u2019 ll be back another day . \" Baffert concurred , stating that the horse was \" fine \" , but had been troubled by the poor break and by mud hitting his face . Paynter 's next race was the Grade I Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28 . He started from the seven post with his former rider , Martin Garcia up . After running in the middle of the pack and going five horses wide coming into the stretch , he finished second to Mucho Macho Man . His placing was viewed by sportswriters as proof that he could run against top competitors . Baffert said Paynter was still \" a bit rusty , \" but the trainer was happy with Paynter 's race . He was entered in the Breeders ' Cup Classic , on November 2 . Before the race , he had a very strong workout and Baffert said that Paynter was \" a monster \" and \" back to top form \" , and Ahmed Zayat stated , \" Paynter is a horse like no other ... The fact that he 's even competing in the Breeders ' Cup is miraculous . \" Though he finished 7th out of 11 horses , with Mucho Macho Man winning again , Paynter finished ahead of a fellow Awesome Again son , the stakes-winning favorite Game On Dude . After the Breeders ' Cup , Paynter was retired and shipped to WinStar Farm to begin his stud career . His initial stud fee was set at $ 25,000 for the 2014 breeding season . Anticipating his arrival , WinStar commissioned a unique , colorful 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) long graffiti-style mural , created by Louisville street artist Braylyn Stewart . The artwork featured the slogan \" Paynter : Awesome Heart , \" and was surrounded by quotations about the horse and assorted references to his racing career . The decision to use graffiti art as a promotional tool was to reflect Paynter 's toughness and \" street fighter \" image . Artist Stewart also expressed hope that the artwork would help put graffiti art in a positive light and encourage young people to \" get involved with the arts . \" = = Racing statistics = = = = Pedigree = = Paynter was sired by the Canadian-bred Awesome Again , winner of the 1998 Breeders ' Cup Classic . At stud , Awesome Again has sired many stakes winners including Ghostzapper , who was 2004 Breeders ' Cup winner and 2004 Horse of the Year , and two-time Santa Anita Handicap winner Game On Dude , another Bob Baffert-trained horse . Paynter is closely related to 2013 Preakness Stakes winner Oxbow ; the two horses share the same sire and are out of full sisters . Both horses have pedigrees outcrossed for four generations , with very little inbreeding , 4x5x5 to Northern Dancer . Paynter 's dam is Tizso , a full sister to Tiznow , who was 2000 Horse of the Year and won the Breeders ' Cup Classic twice . Tizso 's dam , Cee 's Song , is credited with raising the respect breeders have for her female breeding line , Thoroughbred family 26 , as one of the top distaff lines in America . Five full siblings out of Cee 's Song were either race winners or the dams of race winners : Paynter 's dam Tizso and Oxbow 's dam Tizamazing both foaled stakes winners , and Tiznow , Tizbud and Tizdubai all won stakes races . Another Cee 's Song son , the gelding Budroyale , was second in the 1999 Breeders ' Cup Classic .",

                    "text": "Julia Baird = Julia Baird ( n\u00e9e Dykins ) ( born 5 March 1947 ) is the younger half-sister of English musician John Lennon and is the eldest daughter of John ' Bobby ' Albert Dykins ( 1918 \u2013 December 1965 ) and Julia Lennon ( 12 March 1914 \u2013 15 July 1958 ) . she also had an older half-sister , Ingrid Pedersen . Her younger sister was Jacqueline ' Jackie ' Dykins ( born 26 October 1949 ) . Lennon started visiting the Dykins ' house in 1951 . After the death of Julia Lennon in 1958 , Harriet and Norman Birch were appointed guardians of Julia and Jackie , ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married their mother . Lennon invited the Dykins sisters to visit after the success of the Beatles , when he was living in Kenwood , Weybridge , with his then-wife , Cynthia Lennon . Julia Dykins ( Baird ) married Allen Baird in 1968 and moved to Belfast . They had three children together but were divorced in 1981 . Baird worked as a special needs teacher , and after Lennon 's death she wrote John Lennon , My Brother ( with Geoffrey Giuliano ) and gave up working in 2004 to write Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon . She is now a director of Cavern City Tours in Liverpool . = = Early years = = Baird 's mother , Julia Lennon , was the fourth of five children in the Stanley family : Mary , known as ' Mimi ' ( 1906 \u2013 1991 ) , Elizabeth ' Mater ' ( 1908 \u2013 1976 ) , Anne ' Nanny ' ( 1911 \u2013 1988 ) , Julia ' Judy ' ( 1914 \u2013 1958 ) , and Harriet ' Harrie ' ( 1916 \u2013 1972 ) . John Lennon was Julia 's first child by Alfred Lennon , although she later had a daughter called Victoria ( renamed Ingrid ) after an affair with a Welsh soldier while Alfred was at sea . Julia was forced to give up the child for adoption after intense pressure from her father and her sisters . Although they had known each other previously , Julia started dating Dykins while working in a caf\u00e9 near Mosspits , which was Lennon 's primary school . Dykins was said to be a good-looking , well-dressed man who was several years older than Julia and worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward . Julia later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins , who had access to rationed goods like alcohol , chocolate , silks and cigarettes . The Stanley sisters called Dykins a \" spiv \" , because of his pencil-thin moustache , margarine-coated hair , and pork-pie hat , but the young Lennon called him \" Twitchy \" because of a physical tic and nervous cough Dykins had . Although Julia never divorced Alfred Lennon , she was the common-law wife of Dykins , although Paul McCartney admitted to being sarcastic to Lennon about his mother living in sin while Julia was still married . Julia 's sister , Mimi , called Julia and Dykins ' home \u2014 at 1 Blomfield Road , Liverpool \u2014 \" The House of Sin \" and her own house ( where Lennon lived ) \" The House of Correction \" . When Jackie was born prematurely on 26 October 1949 , Julia went back to the hospital every day to see her , although she was often not allowed ( by Mimi ) to visit Lennon . Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool , which allowed Julia to stay at home at Blomfield Road , to look after Baird , Jackie , a cat named \" Elvis \" , and the 11-year-old Lennon , who had started to visit and occasionally stayed overnight . Baird would give up her bed to Lennon , and share Jackie 's double bed . Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money ( one shilling ) for doing odd jobs , such as collecting golf balls on the local course , on top of the five shillings that Lennon 's Aunt Mimi gave him . During Lennon 's visits , he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie , test Baird 's spelling , and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend . Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them , her mother would often play a record called , My Son John , To Me You Are So Wonderful , \" by some old crooner , and sit and listen to it \" . \" My Son John \" \u2014 sung by David Whitfield \u2014 was released in 1956 . Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt 's croft in Sango Bay , Durness , Scotland , for his holidays , he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family . Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street , Liverpool , to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen on the back of a flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957 . Baird was allowed to sit on the back , but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off . The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool 's charter by King John . Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road because they said the acoustics \" sounded like a recording studio \" . = = = Legal guardian = = = Baird 's mother was struck and killed on 15 July 1958 , just outside Mimi 's home , by a Standard Vanguard car driven by an off-duty constable , PC Eric Clague , who was a learner-driver . Clague later said : \" Mrs Lennon just ran straight out in front of me . I just couldn 't avoid her . I was not speeding , I swear it . It was just one of those terrible things that happen . \" Baird and Jackie ( aged eleven and eight respectively ) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater 's , and were not allowed to attend the funeral . They were told two months later by Norman Birch ( Lennon 's uncle ) that their mother had died . Lennon 's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls \u2014 ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married Julia . Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool . Her grave is unmarked , and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . Baird and Jackie were taken to live with the Birches and their son at The Dairy Cottage , which was owned by Mimi 's husband , George Smith . At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself , where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House , although Baird and her friends called it \" frothy coffee \" . At 16 , Baird started to hitch-hike to London , although her Aunt never knew , as she would never have allowed it . Baird talked about the trips to London , and how relatively safe they were : \" Hitching was easy then . It was a way of life . Everything was becoming more free . We 'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties . People always gave us a place to stay \u2013 we were never harmed . \" Baird and Jackie were asked to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964 . Cynthia Lennon \u2014 Lennon 's wife at the time \u2014 took them both out shopping in Knightsbridge , buying them expensive clothes . During the same visit , The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria , and the sisters asked to be allowed to stand near the front , but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush . In December 1965 , Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane . Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards . Dykins had married again , but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife , and did not attend their father 's funeral . In 1968 , Lennon was told The Dairy Cottage was too cramped for them all , so he told Birch to buy a house , and he found a 4-bedroom house in Gateacre Park Drive , Liverpool . Lennon told Birch to furnish and decorate it , and to send all the bills to him . The Dykinses heard nothing from Lennon for years , until he phoned Baird in 1975 , and asked for mementos of his childhood life , such as his school tie and photographs . He sent \u00a3 3,000 to cover the cost of shipping and as a gift , but wrote , \" Don 't tell Mimi \" . Lennon continued to call Baird until 1976 , when the calls stopped . Jackie worked as a shop assistant during the 1970s , but battled against a heroin addiction . In the 1980s , and fully recovered , Jackie gave birth to her son , John , later working as a hairstylist . After Lennon and Harriet died , Yoko Ono wanted to sell the house \u2014 as it was still in Lennon 's name \u2014 but later gave it to the Salvation Army on 2 November 1993 , even though Lennon had once written : \" I always thought of the house he 's in [ Birch ] as my contribution towards looking after Julia [ Baird ] and Jackie . I would prefer the girls to use it . \" = = Later years = = Julia married Allen Baird in 1968 , they moved to Belfast and kept her family history a secret . The Bairds had three children : Nicholas ( b . 1971 ) , Sara ( b . 1972 ) and David ( b . 1980 ) , and were divorced in 1981 . Baird went to university and gained an MA in philosophy of education , and during her the course of her degree she spent a year off in France , hitch-hiked around Europe , and protested against the war in Vietnam in Paris alongside Simone de Beauvoir . Baird later taught French and English before working as a special needs teacher with teenagers in deprived areas of Chester , until she retired to write books and become a director of Cavern City Tours . Baird and Jackie met their half-sister Ingrid Pedersen for the first time when they were present at the ceremony to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi 's house , commemorating the fact that Lennon had lived there . Baird and Jackie had only recently found out who Pedersen was , after being told by journalist Bill Smithies of the Liverpool Echo . Baird was shocked that Pedersen did not look anything like the Stanley or the Lennon family , having pale blue eyes and fair hair . After releasing the book , John Lennon , My Brother \u2014 written with Giuliano , and a foreword by McCartney \u2014 Baird travelled to New York during 1989 to appear at a Beatlefest convention , and was asked if she could prove she was really Lennon 's half-sister . Baird declined , saying she was not going to produce her passport , and the audience would just have to take her word for it . In 2000 , Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs , erected on major routes into Liverpool , saying , \" Liverpool welcomes you \u2013 to the birthplace of THE BEATLES \" , and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool 's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon 's birthday . Baird retired in 2004 , and published a book called Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon , in February 2007 . From 28 to 30 September 2007 , Durness held the John Lennon Northern Lights Festival which was attended by Baird ( who read from Lennon 's writings and her own books ) and Stanley Parkes ( Lennon 's Scottish cousin ) . Parkes said , \" Me and Julia [ Baird ] are going to be going to the old family croft to tell stories \" . Musicians , painters and poets from across the UK performed at the festival . Baird now lives in Chester with her partner , Roger Keys . Baird claims she was never told that her mother was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool , although the graveyard 's location is approximately 1.19 miles east of 1 Blomfield Road . The grave was unmarked , but was recently identified as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . The Stanley family finally put a headstone on her mother 's grave . The headstone reads : Mummy John Victoria Julie Jackie .",

                    "text": "Ramariopsis kunzei = Ramariopsis kunzei is an edible species of coral fungi in the Clavariaceae family , and the type species of the genus Ramariopsis . It is commonly known as white coral because of the branched structure of the fruit bodies that resemble marine coral . The fruit bodies are up to 5 cm ( 2.0 in ) tall by 4 cm ( 1.6 in ) wide , with numerous branches originating from a short rudimentary stem . The branches are one to two millimeters thick , smooth , and white , sometimes with yellowish tips in age . Ramariopsis kunzei has a widespread distribution , and is found in North America , Europe , Asia , and Australia . = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = The species was first described as Clavaria kunzei by pioneer mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 . E.J.H. Corner transferred the species to Ramariopsis in 1950 , and made it the type species . In general , coral fungi often have extensive taxonomic histories , as mycologists have not agreed on the best way to classify them . In addition to Clavaria and Ramariopsis , the R. kunzei has been placed in the genera Ramaria by Lucien Qu\u00e9let in 1888 , and Clavulinopsis by Walter J\u00fclich in 1985 . According to the taxonomic database MycoBank , the species has acquired a sizable list of synonyms , listed in the taxobox . It is commonly known as white coral because of the branched structure of the fruit bodies that resemble marine coral . A phylogenetic analysis of clavarioid fungi concluded that R. kunzei is in a phylogenetic lineage together with several Clavulinopsis species ( including C. sulcata , C. helvola and C. fusiformis ) , and that this clade ( the ramariopsis clade ) is nested within a group of species representing the Clavariaceae family . = = Description = = The fruit bodies of Ramariopsis kunzei are white to whitish-yellow in color , and are highly branched structures resembling coral ; the dimensions are typically up to 8 cm ( 3.1 in ) tall and 6 cm ( 2.4 in ) wide . Older specimens may have a pinkish tinge . The tips of the branches are blunt , not crested as in some other species of coral fungi , like Clavulina cristata ; branches are between 1 and 5 millimeters thick . The branch tips of mature specimens may be yellow . A stem , if present , may be up to 1 cm ( 0.4 in ) long and scurfy \u2014 covered with small flakes or scales . The texture of the flesh may range from pliable to brittle . This fungus does not undergo any color changes upon bruising or injury , however , a 10 % solution of FeSO4 ( a chemical test known as \" iron salts \" ) applied to the flesh will turn it green . In deposit , the spores are white . Viewed with a light microscope , the spores are translucent and have an ellipsoid to roughly spherical shape with spines on the surface , and dimensions of 3 \u2013 5.5 by 2.5 \u2013 4.5 \u00b5m . Spores are non-amyloid , meaning that they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The spore-bearing cells , the basidia , are usually 25 \u2013 45 \u00b5m long by 6 \u2013 7 \u00b5m wide , and 4-spored . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of this species . = = = Edibility = = = The species is edible , but \" fleshless and flavorless . \" Other authors concur that the odor and taste are not distinctive . = = = Similar species = = = The \" crested coral \" ( Clavulina cristata , edible ) is similar in appearance to R. kunzei , but its branches have fringed , feathery tips . The \" jellied false coral \" ( Tremellodendron pallidum , edible ) has whitish , tough , cartilaginous branches with blunt tips . = = Habitat and distribution = = The species is thought to be saprobic and can be found growing on the ground , in duff , or less frequently on well-decayed wood . Fruit bodies may grow singly , in groups , or clustered together . David Arora has noted a preference for growing under conifers , as well as a prevalence in redwood forests of North America . In contrast , an earlier author claimed this species grows \" rarely in coniferous woods . \" In Europe , Ramariopsis kunzei has been collected in Scotland ( specifically , on the islands of Arran , Gigha and Kintyre peninsula ) , the Netherlands , Norway , former Czechoslovakia , Germany , Poland , and Russia ( Zhiguli Mountains ) . It has also been found in China , India , Iran , the Solomon Islands , and Australia . In North America , the distribution extends north to Canada , and includes the United States ( including Hawaii and Puerto Rico ) .",

                    "text": "Boletus abruptibulbus = Boletus abruptibulbus is a species of bolete mushroom in the family Boletaceae . Described as new to science in 2009 , it is found only in the Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle , where it grows on the ground in coastal sand dunes , one of only three North American boletes known to favor this habitat . The fruit bodies have convex brownish caps up to 8 cm ( 3.1 in ) in diameter , supported by solid yellowish to reddish stems measuring 3 \u2013 5 cm ( 1.2 \u2013 2.0 in ) long by 10 \u2013 15 mm ( 0.4 \u2013 0.6 in ) thick . The pores on the underside of the cap measure about 1 \u2013 2 mm in diameter and are initially pale yellow before developing a greenish tinge in age . The mushroom 's spores , about 20 micrometers long , are unusually long for a member of the Boletaceae . The stem base is bulbous , a diagnostic feature for which the species is named . = = Taxonomy = = The species was described as new to science in 2009 by Beatriz Ortiz-Santana , William Roody , and Ernst Both in the journal Mycotaxon . The holotype material was collected at St. Joseph Peninsula State Park in Florida in January 2005 . In 2007 , Roody and Both published a short description and color photograph of the species in their field guide Mushrooms of the Southeastern United States , but this was not a valid name as it lacked a Latin description . The specific epithet abruptibulbus refers to the abruptly ( abrupti- ) swollen ( -bulbus ) shape of the bulb at the base of the stem . = = Description = = The convex cap measures 30 \u2013 80 mm ( 1.2 \u2013 3.1 in ) in diameter . Slightly sticky when wet , the cap surface is shiny and smooth . Sometimes , the surface has flattened filaments ( formed from aggregated hyphae ) , and may develop cracks . The thin and easily detached cap cuticle is initially reddish brown to dark brown , later becoming cinnamon brown . The cap margin is curved inward when young , but becomes bent downward when mature . The white to very pale yellow cap flesh does not change color when exposed to air , and has a pleasant odor and mild taste . The tubes comprising the hymenophore on the underside of the cap measure 3 \u2013 8 mm ( 0.1 \u2013 0.3 in ) long and are pale yellow initially before developing a greenish tinge in age . The pore surface does not stain when it is bruised . The pores are roughly spherical or polyhedral at first , becoming angular to pentagonal in age , and almost gill-like near the attachment to the stem . Pores are about 1 \u2013 2 mm in diameter . The stem is solid ( i.e. , not hollow ) 3 \u2013 5 cm ( 1.2 \u2013 2.0 in ) long , 10 \u2013 15 mm ( 0.4 \u2013 0.6 in ) thick in the upper part , expanding to 2 \u2013 2.5 cm ( 0.8 \u2013 1.0 in ) at the bulbous base . It has pseudorrhiza ( cord-like structures resembling a plant root ) that are 0.5 \u2013 1.5 cm ( 0.2 \u2013 0.6 in ) long . The stem surface is dry and smooth except for a powdery region near the apex . The top of the stem is yellow , but it gradually becomes reddish approaching the bulbous base . The stem tissue is pale yellow , although tunnels dug by insect larvae are reddish brown . A drop of dilute ammonia ( as a 12 % NH4OH solution ) placed on the cap surface immediately turns dark red . If placed on the bulbous part of the stem base of a dried specimen , it will turn dark for roughly 15 seconds before starting to fade . The spores are smooth , spindle-shaped , and measure 13.5 \u2013 19.8 by 5.0 \u2013 7.2 \u00b5m \u2014 rather large for a member of the Boletaceae . Grayish-yellow or greenish yellow when mounted in a dilute potassium hydroxide , they are dextrinoid ( yellowish- or reddish-brown ) when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The basidia ( spore-bearing cells in the hymenium ) are club-shaped , hyaline ( translucent ) , four-spored , and measure 28.8 \u2013 42.3 by 7.2 \u2013 11.7 \u00b5m . The hymenium contains basidioles ( immature or aborted basidia ) , which are club-shaped and measure 20.7 \u2013 35.1 by 7.2 \u2013 9.0 \u00b5m . Pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the surface of the tubes ) range in shape from somewhat spindle-shaped to cylindrical , and are hyaline , smooth , and thin-walled , with dimensions of 41.4 \u2013 61.2 by 7.2 \u2013 10.8 \u00b5m . Cystidia on the edges of the pores ( cheilocystidia ) are 31.5 \u2013 49.5 by 7.2 \u2013 13.5 \u00b5m , spindle-shaped to centrally swollen , hyaline , smooth , and thin-walled . Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae . The bulbous base , large spores , and distinctive habitat are characteristic features that make this species readily distinguishable from other boletes . It has a coloration and cap texture similar to Boletus flaviporus and B. auriporus , but the spores of these species are shorter ( 11 \u2013 15 \u00b5m and 11 \u2013 16 \u00b5m , respectively ) . = = Habitat and distribution = = The fruit bodies of Boletus abruptibulbus grow singly or in groups in sand . The species is known only from the Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle , where fruiting occurs on older sand dunes , particularly in areas where the habit changes from coastal scrub to oak-pine woods . This latter habitat is characterized by the presence of the tree species Sand Live Oak ( Quercus geminata ) , Myrtle Oak ( Q. myrtifolia ) , and Sand Pine ( Pinus clausa ) . Fruiting occurs from December to March . Boletus abruptibulbus is one of only three North American Boletaceae species that occur in coastal sand dunes ; the others are Leccinum arenicola , found in New Brunswick , Canada , and Phylloporus arenicola , described from Oregon .",

                    "text": "Chroogomphus vinicolor = Chroogomphus vinicolor , commonly known as the wine-cap Chroogomphus or the pine spike , is a species of mushroom in the family Gomphidiaceae . Found in North America and the Dominican Republic , mushrooms grow on the ground under pine trees . Fruit bodies have reddish-brown , shiny caps up to 7.5 cm ( 3.0 in ) wide atop tapered stems up to 7.5 cm ( 3.0 in ) long . The gills are thick , initially pale orange before turning blackish , and extend a short way down the length of the stem . Although the mushroom is edible , and sold in local markets in Mexico , it is not highly rated . Distinguishing this species from some other similar Chroogomphus species is difficult , as their morphology is similar , and cap coloration is too variable to be a reliable characteristic . C. vinicolor is differentiated from the European C. rutilus and the North American C. ochraceus by the thickness of its cystidial walls . = = Taxonomy = = The species was first described as Gomphidius vinicolor in 1898 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck , based on specimens collected near Lake Mohonk in Ulster County , New York . Peck noted a resemblance to Gomphidius roseus , which he thought was closely related . It was transferred to the newly created genus Chroogomphus by Orson K. Miller , Jr. in 1964 . Molecular analysis of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences shows that C. vinicolor groups in a clade with the closely related C. jamaicensis and C. pseudovinicolor . All of these species feature darkly-amyloid flesh and thick-walled cystidia . Based on this analysis , Miller considered C. jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C. vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species ; however , as of 2012 , both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species . The specific epithet vinicolor means \" wine-colored \" . It is commonly known as the \" wine-cap Chroogomphus \" or the \" pine spike \" . = = Description = = The fruit body of C. vinicolor has caps that are initially conical to convex before later flattening out , sometimes developing a small umbo , or a central depression ; the caps measure 2 \u2013 10 cm ( 0.8 \u2013 3.9 in ) wide . Its color is highly variable , ranging from wine-red to reddish-brown to orange-brown or yellow-brown . Wine-red stains develop where the surface has dried or become rotten . The smooth cap surface is shiny , somewhat sticky when wet , and often radially streaked . The flesh is thick and orangish to ochraceous in color ; its taste and odor have been variously described as \" not distinctive \" or \" pleasant \" . The thick gills are decurrent ( attached to and extending a short ways down the stem ) , well spaced , ochraceous buff to pale orange when young , but turning to blackish after the spores mature . In his original description , Peck noted that the gills , when viewed with a hand lens , \" appear velvety due to the abundant spores \" . The fruit bodies are initially covered with a thin , web-like partial veil that soon disappears as the cap expands . The cylindrical stem measures 2.5 \u2013 15 cm ( 1.0 \u2013 5.9 in ) long by 0.2 \u2013 2 cm ( 0.1 \u2013 0.8 in ) thick , and taper towards the base . It is ochraceous to wine red or reddish-brown with a dry , smooth to fibrillose surface . The partial veil sometimes leaves an indistinct , thin fibrous ring on the upper stem . The spore print is greyish-black . Spores are narrowly elliptical to spindle-shaped , smooth , and measure 17 \u2013 23 by 4.5 \u2013 7.5 \u03bcm . The cystidia are somewhat spindle-shaped or narrowly club-shaped , and measure 112 \u2013 164 by 13 \u2013 20 \u00b5m . They have characteristically thick walls , up to 7.5 \u00b5m wide in the middle portion . Although the mushroom is edible , and is often free of insect damage , it is not highly recommended , \" except as \" fillers \" to include with the more flavorful species \" . The flavor may improve with drying . C. vinicolor mushrooms are sold in local markets at Tetela del Volcan in the state of Morelos , Mexico . There is a report of this species causing a contact sensitivity , in which an individual who had handled the mushroom developed a burning sensation in the eyes and an itchy rash on the eyelid after rubbing the eyes . = = = Similar species = = = Two other Chroogomphus species with a morphology and coloration similar to C. vinicolor include C. rutilus and C. ochraceous . C. vinicolor is most reliably distinguished from these on the basis of having thick-walled cystidia ( up to 5 \u2013 7.5 \u03bcm at the widest part ) . The other two species have been separated on the basis of color , with C. ochraceous having brighter colors ( yellowish-orange to ochraceous ) than C. rutilus . Molecular analyses of European and North American collections suggest that C. rutilus is restricted to Europe , C. ochraceous only occurs in North America , and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination . Another nearly identical species is C. jamaicensis , found in the Dominican Republic , Jamaica , and the Greater Antilles . It is distinguished microscopically by its slightly smaller spores measuring 17 \u2013 20 by 4.5 \u2013 6 \u03bcm , cystidia with more uniformly thickened walls up to 5 \u03bcm thick , and cuticular hyphae that measure 2 \u2013 5 \u03bcm wide . The fruit bodies of C. pseudovinicolor are more robust , with wooly or scaly reddish stems up to 5 cm ( 2.0 in ) thick . Further , this species tends to produce spore prints that are greener than those of C. vinicolor . = = Habitat and distribution = = The mycorrhizal fungus sometimes fruits singly , but more often in scattered or groups on the ground under pines and other conifers . Fruiting usually occurs in the cooler weather of later summer and autumn . In coastal California , however , fruiting occurs in winter . It is often found near Suillus luteus and Suillus brevipes , and is known to parasitize the mycelium of both those and the truffle-like Rhizopogon species . Chroogomphus vinicolor has a widespread range in North America , extending south to Mexico . It has also been recorded from the Dominican Republic .",

                    "text": "Tiger shark = The tiger shark ( Galeocerdo cuvier ) is a species of requiem shark and the only extant member of the genus Galeocerdo . Commonly known as the \" Sea Tiger \" , the tiger shark is a relatively large macropredator , capable of attaining a length over 5 m ( 16 ft 5 in ) . It is found in many tropical and temperate waters , and it is especially common around central Pacific islands . Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body which resemble a tiger 's pattern , which fade as the shark matures . The tiger shark is a solitary , mostly nocturnal hunter and is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks , consuming a variety of prey ranging from crustaceans , fish , seals , birds , squid , turtles and sea snakes to dolphins and even other smaller sharks . The tiger shark has been known to eat inedible manmade objects that linger in its stomach , and it has a reputation as a \" garbage eater \" . While the tiger shark sits atop the food chain as an apex predator , killer whales have been known on occasion to prey on them . The tiger shark is considered a near threatened species due to finning and fishing by humans . = = Taxonomy = = The shark was first described by Peron and Lesueur in 1822 , and was given the name Squalus cuvier . M\u00fcller and Henle in 1837 renamed it Galeocerdo tigrinus . The genus , Galeocerdo , is derived from the Greek galeos , which means shark , and the Latin cerdus , the word for the hard hairs of pigs . It is often colloquially called the man-eater shark . The tiger shark is a member of the order Carcharhiniformes , the most species-rich order of sharks , with more than 270 species also including the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks . Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes , two dorsal fins , an anal fin , and five gill slits . It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family , commonly referred to as requiem sharks . This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks , such as the blue shark ( Prionace glauca ) , lemon shark ( Negaprion brevirostris ) , and bull shark ( Carcharhinus leucas ) . = = Description = = The tiger shark commonly attains a length of 3.25 \u2013 4.25 m ( 10 ft 8 in \u2013 13 ft 11 in ) and weighs around 385 \u2013 635 kg ( 849 \u2013 1,400 lb ) . Sometimes , an exceptionally large male tiger shark can grow up to 4 m ( 13 ft 1 in ) . Females are larger , and exceptionally big ones can reportedly measure over 5 m ( 16 ft 5 in ) . One female specimen caught off Australia reportedly measured 5.5 m ( 18 ft 1 in ) long and weighed an exceptional 1,524 kg ( 3,360 lb ) , although her weight is thought to have been bolstered by her pregnant state at the time . Even larger specimens have been reported , but are unconfirmed . Among the largest extant sharks , the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) , the basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximus ) and the great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) . Some other species such as megamouth sharks ( Megachasma pelagios ) , Pacific sleeper sharks ( Somniosus pacificus ) , Greenland sharks ( Somniosus microcephalus ) and bluntnose sixgill sharks ( Hexanchus griseus ) broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark , but as these species are comparatively poorly studied , it is unclear whether their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark . The great hammerhead ( Sphyrna mokarran ) , a member of the same taxonomic order as the tiger shark , has a similar or even greater average body length but is lighter and less bulky , with a maximum known weight of 580 kg ( 1,280 lb ) . Its teeth are specialized to slice through flesh , bone , and other tough substances such as turtle shells . Like most sharks , its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth . = = = Skin = = = The skin of a tiger shark can typically range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly . The advantage of this is that when it is hunting for its prey , when prey looks at the shark from above , the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker . And when prey is below the shark and looks up , of course because of the sun , it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark . This is known as countershading . Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures . Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped , which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side . They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini , which enable them to detect electric fields , including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey , which helps them to hunt . Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides . The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water . These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey . = = = Vision = = = A reflective layer behind the tiger shark 's retina , called the tapetum lucidum , allows light-sensing cells a second chance to capture photons of visible light , enhancing vision in low light conditions . A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water , while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed . Tiger sharks normally swim using small body movements . Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot , allowing it to spin quickly on its axis , though the shark 's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail . = = Distribution and habitat = = The tiger shark is often found close to the coast , mainly in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the world . Its behavior is primarily nomadic , but is guided by warmer currents , and it stays closer to the equator throughout the colder months . It tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs , but it does move into channels to pursue prey in shallower waters . In the western Pacific Ocean , the shark has been found as far north as Japan and as far south as New Zealand . A tiger shark tagged in the Caribbean has been tracked migrating to Cape Cod ; although they are a tropical species , the warm Gulf Stream brings the coast of Cape Cod to within the extreme north of its range during the summer . Tiger sharks can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico , North American beaches , and parts of South America . It is also commonly known in the Caribbean Sea . Other locations where tiger sharks are seen include off Africa , China , Hong Kong , India , Australia , and Indonesia . Certain tiger sharks have been recorded at depths just shy of 900 m ( 3,000 ft ) , but some sources claim they move into shallow water normally thought to be too shallow for a species of its size . A recent study showed the average tiger shark would be recorded at 350 m ( 1,100 ft ) , making it uncommon to see tiger sharks in shallow water . However , tiger sharks in Hawaii have been observed in depths as shallow as 3 m ( 10 ft ) and regularly observed in coastal waters at depths of 6 to 12 m ( 20 to 40 ft ) . = = Feeding = = The tiger shark is an apex predator and has a reputation for eating anything . Young tiger sharks are found to prey largely on small fish , as well as various small jellyfish , cephalopods , and other mollusks . Around the time they attain 2.3 m ( 7.5 ft ) , or near sexual maturity , their prey selection expands considerably , and much larger animals become regular prey . Numerous fish , crustaceans , sea birds , sea snakes , marine mammals ( e.g. bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops ) , common dolphins ( Delphinus ) , spotted dolphins ( Stenella ) , dugongs ( Dugong dugon ) , seals and sea lions ) , and sea turtles ( including the three largest species : the leatherback ( Dermochelys coriacea ) , the loggerhead ( Caretta caretta ) and the green sea turtles ( Chelonia mydas ) , ) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks . The tiger shark also eats other sharks ( including adult sandbar sharks ( Carcharhinus plumbeus ) ) , as well as rays , and will sometimes even eat other tiger sharks . Due to high risk of predatory attacks , dolphins often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks . Tiger sharks may also attack injured or ailing whales and prey upon them . A group was documented attacking and killing an ailing humpback whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) in 2006 near Hawaii . The tiger shark also scavenges on dead whales . In one such documented incident , they were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside great white sharks . Evidence of dugong predation was identified in one study that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast . Additionally , examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks . Finally , dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant . The broad , heavily calcified jaws and nearly terminal mouth , combined with robust , serrated teeth , enable the tiger shark to take on these large prey . In addition , excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source . The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence , even in murky water . The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout . When attacking , the shark often eats its prey whole , although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time . Notably , terrestrial mammals , including horses ( Equus ferus caballus ) , goats ( Capra aegagrus hircus ) , sheep ( Ovis aries ) , dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ) , cats ( Felis catus ) , brown rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) , are fairly common in the stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii . In one case , remains of two flying-foxes were found in stomach of this shark . Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style , it often mistakenly eats inedible objects , such as automobile license plates , oil cans , tires , and baseballs . = = = Swimming efficiency and stealth = = = All tiger sharks generally swim slowly , which , combined with cryptic coloration , may make them difficult for prey to detect them in some habitats . They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds . Despite their sluggish appearance , tiger sharks are one of the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks . Once the shark has come close , a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape . = = Reproduction = = Males reach sexual maturity at 2.3 to 2.9 m ( 7.5 to 9.5 ft ) and females at 2.5 to 3.5 m ( 8.2 to 11.5 ft ) . Females mate once every three years . They breed by internal fertilization . The male inserts one of his claspers into the female 's genital opening ( cloaca ) , acting as a guide for the sperm . The male uses his teeth to hold the female still during the procedure , often causing the female considerable discomfort . Mating in the Northern Hemisphere generally takes place between March and May , with birth between April and June the following year . In the Southern Hemisphere , mating takes place in November , December , or early January . The tiger shark is the only species in its family that is ovoviviparous ; its eggs hatch internally and the young are born live when fully developed . The young develop inside the mother 's body for up to 16 months . Litters range from 10 to 80 pups . A newborn is generally 51 to 76 cm ( 20 to 30 in ) long . This shark typically reaches maturity at lengths of 2 to 3 m ( 6.6 to 9.8 ft ) . It is unknown how long tiger sharks live , but they can live longer than 12 years . = = Conservation = = The tiger shark is captured and killed for its fins , flesh , and liver . It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries . Several populations have declined where they have been heavily fished . Continued demand for fins may result in further declines in the future . Tiger sharks are considered a near threatened species due to excessive finning and fishing by humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature . While shark fin has very few nutrients , shark liver has a high concentration of vitamin A which is used in the production of vitamin oils . In addition , the tiger shark is captured and killed for its distinct skin , as well as by big-game fishers . In 2010 , Greenpeace International added the tiger shark to its seafood red list , which is a list of fish commonly sold around the world , and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries . = = Relationship with humans = = Although it is very rare for sharks to bite humans , the tiger shark is reported to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark attacks , and is sometimes regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species . They often visit shallow reefs , harbors , and canals , creating the potential for encounter with humans . The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water . While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans , its bite rate is low . The tiger is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans , with the great white shark being first . On average , three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii , but they are rarely fatal . This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim , surf , and dive in Hawaiian waters every day . Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November , when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth . Between 1959 and 2000 , 4,668 tiger sharks were culled in an effort to protect the tourism industry . These efforts , despite damaging the shark population , were shown to be ineffective in decreasing the number of interactions between humans and tiger sharks . It is illegal to feed sharks in Hawaii ( except for traditional Hawaiian cultural or religious practices ) , and interaction with them , such as cage diving , is discouraged . South African shark behaviorist and shark diver Mark Addison demonstrated divers could interact and dive with them outside of a shark cage in a 2007 Discovery Channel special , and underwater photographer Fiona Ayerst swam with them in the Bahamas . = = Mythology = = The tiger shark is considered to be sacred na \u02bbaumakua ( ancestor spirits ) by some native Hawaiians who think their eyeballs have special powers of visual perception . This aligns with the general known facts about sharks and their highly developed senses .",

                    "text": "Cicuta = Cicuta , commonly known as water hemlock , is a small genus of four species of highly poisonous plants in the family Apiaceae . They are perennial herbaceous plants which grow up to 2.5 meters ( 8.2 ft ) tall , having distinctive small green or white flowers arranged in an umbrella shape ( umbel ) . Plants in this genus may also be referred to as cowbane or poison parsnip . Cicuta is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere , mainly North America and Europe , typically growing in wet meadows , along streambanks and other wet and marshy areas . These plants bear a close resemblance to other members in the family Apiaceae and may be confused with a number of other edible and poisonous plants . The common name hemlock may also be confused with poison hemlock ( Conium maculatum ) . Water hemlock is considered one of North America 's most toxic plants , being highly poisonous to humans . Three members of the genus contain a toxin named cicutoxin which causes central nervous system stimulatory effects including seizures following ingestion . Medical treatment of poisoning may include the use of activated charcoal to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of the toxic principle along with supportive care including anticonvulsant drugs such as a benzodiazepine . High doses of anticonvulsant medicine are often required to halt seizure activity and further medical care including intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required . = = Description = = Cicuta spp. are perennial plants that are all similar in morphology , growing up to a maximum of 2.5 meters ( 8.2 ft ) in height . The stem of the plant is branching , erect , smooth and hollow ( except for partitions at the junction of the leaves and stem ) , sometimes being purple-striped , or mottled ( typically only C. maculata has the purple stripes or spots ) . Attached to the base of the stem is a tuberous root with thickened rootstocks . The rootstocks are multichambered and contain a yellowish oily liquid which turns reddish brown on exposure to air and emits a characteristic smell of raw parsnip . The alternate leaves are 2 or 3 pinnately compound and may reach 30 centimeters ( 12 in ) to 90 centimeters ( 35 in ) in length . The leaflets are lanceolate , serrate , 5 centimeters ( 2.0 in ) to 10 centimeters ( 3.9 in ) in length , and sharply toothed . The plant flowers in spring or early summer ; the flowers are small with green or white petals clustered in an umbrella shape ( umbel ) characteristic to this family ; the umbel measures 5 centimeters ( 2.0 in ) to 10 centimeters ( 3.9 in ) across . The plants produce a cylindrical fruit which is 4 millimeters ( 0.16 in ) to 6 millimeters ( 0.24 in ) in length . The plant is spread primarily by seeds which are produced in large numbers and are small in size . = = Taxonomy = = The Cicuta genus is one of many genera in the Apiaceae family which is in the order Apiales . The Apiaceae family is also known as Umbelliferae and both of these family names are permitted to be used by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature . In Europe , Cicuta was not distinguished from the similar genus Conium before the year 1500 . The first mention of the genus in the United States was in the eighteenth century . Carl Linnaeus formally described three species in 1753 . The type species is Cicuta virosa . The genus is now recognized to comprise four species : Other species names such as Cicuta bolanderi , Cicuta californica , and Cicuta curtissii are older names now recognized to be varieties of the widespread , morphologically variable Cicuta maculata . Cicuta maculata is now recognized to have four varieties : var. maculata , var. augustifolia , var. victorinii , and var. bolanderi . Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) loci was not conclusive but seems to show that C. bulbifera and C. virosa are monophyletic , while C. douglasii may not be . It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition as a distinct species . Other common names for the genus in general include poison parsnip , beaver poison , wild carrot , wild parsnip , and false parsley . = = Similar species = = Members of the family Apiaceae bear close resemblance to each other , and have many characteristics in common . Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne ( Angelica archangelica ) , wild celery ( Apium graveolens ) , pignut ( Conopodium majus ) , wild carrot ( Daucus carota ) , wild parsnip ( Pastinaca sativa ) , and water parsnip ( Berula spp . ) . One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip ; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas , and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers . Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are two or three times compound . Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks . Additionally , water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster , not at the base of the main flower head , while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head . Additionally , there can be confusion between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock ( Conium maculatum ) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum . Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure . Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules , while poison hemlock has a single tap root . Another reliable method to identify water hemlock is to examine the leaf veins . Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips , rather than extend to the tip of the leaf , as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family . = = Distribution and habitat = = Cicuta spp. are found growing across North America and Europe . Typically , they grow in wet habitats usually alongside ponds and streams , in marshes or swamps , or areas that are swampy at least part of the year . Plants can also be found growing in water . Of the four species , Cicuta maculata has the most widespread distribution occurring across the majority of North America . Cicuta bulbifera also has a relatively large distribution , found throughout Northern North America . Cicuta douglasii is found in the northwest corner of North America , while Cicuta virosa is only found in central Europe and in the far north of North America . = = Toxicity = = All members of Cicuta except C. bulbifera contain high levels of the poisonous principle cicutoxin , an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally closely related to the toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort . Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and in all parts of the plant , but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring . Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system . It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) receptor antagonist . Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization . In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity . The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures . Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America 's most toxic plants . Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670 . A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century . The LD50 in mice administered cicutoxin by intraperitoneal injection is 48.3 mg per kg body weight ( mg / kg ) ; this compares with 5.9 mg / kg for mice given potassium cyanide by intraperitoneal injection , while the LD50 for arsenic via intraperitoneal injection in mice is 46.2 mg / kg . The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown ; it is thought ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death . Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants . Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant ; a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto the skin and were poisoned , with two children dying . Livestock have long been the worst affected , leading to the common name \" cowbane \" . Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant . In the spring when the ground is soft , grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant out of the ground ingesting both the foiliage and the roots . Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings . Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes . = = = Symptoms = = = Upon consumption , both in humans and other species , the symptoms of poisoning are mainly characterized by generalized seizures . The onset of symptoms following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post ingestion . Initial symptoms reported may include nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , tremors , confusion , weakness , dizziness , and drowsiness ; although the rapid onset of seizure activity may be the first sign presented following poisoning . Seizures are usually described as clonic or tonic \u2013 clonic . Complications of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature , decreases in the pH of the blood ( metabolic acidosis ) , swelling in the brain , blood coagulation disorders , muscle breakdown ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and kidney failure . Additional neurological symptoms may include hallucinations , delirium , tingling , pricking , or numbness of a person 's skin , dilated pupils , and coma . Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart rate and alternating low and high blood pressure . Other cardiac effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR interval , supraventricular tachycardia , and ventricular fibrillation . Symptoms of excess salivation , wheezing , respiratory distress , and absence of breathing have also been reported . Deaths usually occur from respiratory failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity ; fatalities have occurred within a few hours of ingestion . Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48 hours of poisoning , although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours . There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself . Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness , muscle weakness , twitching , and anxiety . Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or , in some cases , these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning . = = = Diagnosis and treatment = = = Water hemlock poisoning is usually diagnosed following a history of plant ingestion and symptoms of abrupt onset of seizures . Laboratory tests to determine the presence of cicutoxin in the blood such as spectrofluorimetry , high pressure liquid chromatography , thin layer chromatography , and mass spectrometry have been used to detect cicutoxin but these tests are not performed routinely in hospital laboratories . If a sample of the plant ingested has been retained , diagnosis can be confirmed by having the plant identified by a botanist . Initial treatment of poisoning may include gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal . Decontamination is typically only performed if a potentially toxic amount of plant matter has been ingested up to one hour previously and the patient has a normal intact airway or has been intubated . There is no specific antidote for water hemlock poisoning and treatment mainly consists of supportive care . Treatment may include control of seizures with the administration of a benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam , or if seizures are refractory to this treatment , a barbiturate such as phenobarbital is administered . The anticonvulsant phenytoin is not recommended as it has not been shown to be effective for seizure control following water hemlock poisoning . Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines or barbiturates may cause respiratory depression and respiratory support including intubation and mechanical ventilation is required in these patients . Continuous electroencephalography monitoring is recommended in symptomatic patients . Further treatment for complications of metabolic acidosis , rhabdomyolysis , hyperthermia , or low blood pressure may be required . Metabolic acidosis is treated by administering sodium bicarbonate . Low blood pressure is usually treated with intravenous fluid replacement , but the administration of dopamine or norepinephrine may be required to restore blood pressure . The management of rhabdomyolysis includes ensuring adequate hydration and urinary alkalinization ; a complication of rhabdomyolysis is acute renal failure which may require management with hemodialysis . However , hemodialysis , hemoperfusion or other extracorporeal techniques do not remove cicutoxin from the blood and are therefore not useful in enhancing elimination .",

                    "text": "Novomessor ensifer = Novomessor ensifer is a species of ant endemic to Mexico . A member of the genus Novomessor in the subfamily Myrmicinae , it was first described by Swiss entomologist Auguste Forel in 1899 . N. ensifer was originally a part of the genus Aphaenogaster until a recent phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct and should be separated . The ant is a medium-sized species , measuring 5.5 to 10 millimetres ( 0.2 to 0.4 in ) . The ant is ferruginous-colored in some certain parts of the body , and small workers ( nanitics ) in incipient colonies are noticeably different in color and body structure . N. ensifer is active throughout the day , where they forage on the ground and sometimes on low herbs . Colonies are found under stones and other objects in tropical dry forests and pine-oak forests . These ants are solitary foragers and predominately feed on insects such as wasps and months . The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard ( Phrynosoma asio ) . While nothing is known about its reproduction , nuptial flight may take place during spring or summer , where queens establish their nests under stones and other objects . = = Taxonomy = = Novomessor ensifer was originally described as Aphaenogaster ensifera in 1899 by Swiss entomologist Auguste Forel , who provided the first dscription of N. ensifer in his third volume of Biologia Centrali-Americana . Among the genus Aphaenogaster , Italian entomologist Carlo Emery placed N. ensifer in the subgenus Deromyrma in 1915 , although this is now a synonym . In 1934 , the taxon Novomessor manni was described as a new species of Novomessor based on workers collected by William M. Mann at Colima , Mexico . However , a study showed that N. manni was a synonym of N. ensifer . Brown comments that N. manni was described as a new species because of the supposed distinct features between two type specimens of N. ensifer , but Brown noticed no morphological differences . The exact type locality for N. manni is unknown , but entomologist Paul Kannowski speculates that the ant is restricted to arid scrub forests around the Pacific Slope in Mexico . This speculation is consistent with the preferred habitat of N. ensifer . Novomessor was synonymized in 1974 , although evidence to retain it as a valid genus emerged when scientists discovered an exocrine gastral glandular system in two Novomessor species and none in Aphaenogaster . However , N. ensifer does not have this glandular system . English myrmecologist Barry Bolton argues that basing the genus on such feature cannot justify the separation of Novomessor and Aphaenogaster . In 2015 , a phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct from Aphaenogaster , and the genus was revived from synonymy to include N. ensifer , N. albisetosus and N. cockerelli as members of it . = = Description = = N. ensifer is a medium-sized species , measuring 5.5 to 10 millimetres ( 0.2 to 0.4 in ) . Excluding the mandibles , the head is 1.93 \u2013 2.53 millimetres ( 0.076 \u2013 0.100 in ) long and 1.25 \u2013 1.69 millimetres ( 0.049 \u2013 0.067 in ) wide . The scapes of the antennae surpass the occipital margin , and the second segment of the funiculus is longer than the first . The third and fourth segments are the same length as each other , although they are longer than the second . Between the fifth and second last segments , they are much shorter except for the last one . The head is twice as long than broad , and it is widest behind the eyes . The larvae measure 8 millimetres ( 0.3 in ) in length and appear similar to that of N. albisetosus . The larvae can be distinguished by the abundance of hair with long stouts found on the body . The apical teeth of the mandibles are long and straight , whereas the medial teeth are much smaller . The posterior to the eyes are convex , where it converges towards the occiput ( the back of the head ) and forms a collar seen in several Aphaenogaster species . The ants have large , triangular mandibles with three apical teeth and a flat clypeus . The eyes are large with 400 facets , but workers from small incipient colonies only have 200 facets . Workers from incipient also differ from workers living in mature colonies , notably in size , body shape and coloration . The average length is 5.56 \u2013 6.5 millimetres ( 0.219 \u2013 0.256 in ) ; the head is 1.52 \u2013 1.69 millimetres ( 0.060 \u2013 0.067 in ) long and 0.98 \u2013 1.12 millimetres ( 0.039 \u2013 0.044 in ) wide . The epinotal spines ( spines found on the first abdominal segment that protect the pedicel ) are much shorter . Hair is also less noticeable on the workers . The ant has pubescence ( soft short hair ) abundant throughout some certain parts of the body , including the funiculi and tarsi . It is more sparse on the coxae , genae ( an area on both sides of the head below the eyes ) , gaster and gula ( the reduced sternite of the first segment of the thorax ) . Hairs on the scapes point downwards . Erect and suberect hair are seen all over the body in sparse numbers , although this varies . These hairs are not as abundant in comparison to other Novomessor species . The head and thorax are both ferruginous-colored , and the epinotal spines , legs and node are yellowish red . The antennal scapes are reddish brown and the abdomen is piceous brown . The hair exhibits a gold-like color . The suture is absent from the thorax , and the mesonotum is wider than the epinotum . The front portion of the mesonotum is narrow whereas the back is rectangular . The node is evenly round and oval shaped , the postpetiole is narrow at the front and the dorsum is feebly convex . The gaster is large and oval shaped . = = Distribution and habitat = = N. ensifer is endemic to Mexico and can be found in tropical dry forests at altitudes of between 115 and 1,700 ft ( 35 and 518 m ) above sea level . In some cases , colonies have been found 5,000 ft ( 1,500 m ) below the Pacific Slope . The ant is found throughout several Mexican states within the east , including Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n from the south , and Colima and Jalisco from the north . Nests are commonly found in basins and mountains along the Pacific Slope in pine-oak forests . Scrub-thorn forests are also abundant , consisting of trees and shrubs that are 15 and 25 ft ( 4.6 and 7.6 m ) tall , but other areas may contain low herbs and grasses . Plants and trees such as thorn trees ( Acacia ) , poinciana plants ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ) and Casearia corymbosa have been identified in these habitats . Other identified plants and trees include Indian mallows ( Abutilon ) , spurred anodas ( Anoda cristata ) , Cathestecum erectum , dayflowers ( Commelina ) , cigar plants ( Cuphea ) , hairy crabgrass ( Digitaria sanguinalis ) , crane grass ( Ixophorus unisetus ) , Mimosa , Mexican panicgrass ( Panicum hirticaule ) , Senna uniflora and Setaria liebmannii . These habitats usually have a wet season in summer and autumn and a dry season in spring . N. ensifer is a xerophilous species that can thrive in dry climates . In Colima , colonies are frequent among the basins , but rarely are they found in the mountainous regions . N. ensifer ants prefer to nest in the sand and under large stones , as certain areas in Manzanillo had no stones buried in the soil and no colonies were found alongside hills with plain soil . Most colonies are found under stones with no noticeable craters surrounding the nest entrance , although one colony was found under an Acacia plant . These nest holes are usually 1 in ( 2.5 cm ) in diameter . A single path connects the entrance to the main nest site , followed by a passage that descends straight into the dirt several inches deep . This passage widens under a stone which forms a gallery for the larvae and pupae . Wherever stones are formed , passageways may descend further into the ground and form more chambers . Although it is unknown how deep these passages go , excavated nests are as deep as 15 in ( 38 cm ) . = = Behavior and ecology = = Unlike other Novomessor species , workers forage early in the morning and late afternoon , whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening . However , it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night . Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95 \u2013 100 \u00b0 F ( 35 \u2013 38 \u00b0 C ) , although the ground temperature is considerably higher . Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground , but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds . Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds , and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest . N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft ( 7 m ) away from their home nest . N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on , consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps , bembicine wasps and small moths . When a worker discovers a dead insect , it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately , and other nestmates will join once they detect it . Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions , accidentally tearing it apart . However , the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest . The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard ( Phrynosoma asio ) . Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests , but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown . Nothing is known about its reproduction or nuptial flight . Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February , and the larvae collected were not large enough to be reproductive ants . However , it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer , and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli , alates most likely start to occur by June . After nuptial flight , queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants . This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction . The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs on the side of the larvae . This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group . Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages . Unlike the larvae and pupae , the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries , but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest . In large nests , small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent .",

                    "text": "Silkie = The Silkie ( sometimes spelled Silky ) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage , which is said to feel like silk , and satin . The breed has several other unusual qualities , such as black skin and bones , blue earlobes , and five toes on each foot , whereas most chickens only have four . They are often exhibited in poultry shows , and appear in various colors . In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics , Silkies are well known for their calm , friendly temperament . It is among the most docile of poultry . Hens are also exceptionally broody , and care for young well . Though they are fair layers themselves , laying only about three eggs a week , they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature . = = History = = It is unknown exactly where or when fowl with their singular combination of attributes first appeared , but the most well documented point of origin is ancient China ( hence another occasionally encountered name for the bird , Chinese silk chicken ) . Other places in Southeast Asia have been named as possibilities , such as India and Java . The earliest surviving written account of Silkies comes from Marco Polo , who wrote of a \" furry chicken \" in the 13th century during his travels in Asia . In 1598 , Ulisse Aldrovandi , a writer and naturalist at the University of Bologna , Italy , published a comprehensive treatise on chickens which is still read and admired today . In it , he spoke on \" wool-bearing chickens \" and ones \" clothed with hair like that of a black cat \" . Silkies most likely made their way to the West via the Silk Route and maritime trade . The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874 . Once Silkies became more common in the West , many myths were perpetuated about them . Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits , while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur . In the 21st century , Silkies are one of the most popular and ubiquitous ornamental breeds of chicken . They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers , and are also commonly used to incubate and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like ducks and geese and game birds such as quail and pheasants . = = Characteristics = = Silkies are considered a bantam breed in some countries , but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl ; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time . Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized , but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version . However , even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens , with the males weighing only four pounds ( 1.8 kg ) , and females weighing three pounds ( 1.36 kg ) . The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are 36 ounces ( 1 kg ) , and females that are 32 ounces ( 910 grams ) . Silkie plumage was once unique among chicken breeds , however in recent years silkie feathering has been developed in several breeds , mostly notably the Chabo , where it is now standardised in Britain and the Netherlands . It has been compared to silk , and to fur . The overall result is a soft , fluffy appearance . Their feathers lack functioning barbicels , and are thus similar to down on other birds . This characteristic leaves Silkies unable to fly . Silkies appear in two distinct varieties : bearded and non-bearded . Bearded Silkies have an extra muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes . They also are separated according to color . Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black , blue , buff , grey , partridge , and white . Alternative hues , such as cuckoo , lavender , red , and splash also exist . The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to have a small walnut-colored comb , dark wattles , and turquoise-blue earlobes . In addition to these defining characteristics , Silkies have five toes on each foot . Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking , Faverolles , and Sultan . All Silkies have black skin , bones and grayish-black meat ; their Chinese language name is wu gu ji ( \u70cf\u9aa8\u96de ) , meaning ' black-boned chicken ' . Melanism which extends beyond the skin into an animal 's connective tissue is a rare trait , and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis , which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia . The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation . Disregarding color , the breed does not generally produce as much as the more common meat breeds of chicken . Silkies lay a fair number of eggs , of a cream color , but production is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody ; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year . Their capacity for incubation , which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production , is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds . In addition to being good mothers , Silkies are universally renowned for their calm , friendly temperament . They do well in confinement , and interact very well with children . This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks . = = = Bantams = = = In the American Standard of Perfection , the standard male weight for the bantam Silkie is 1 kg ( 36 oz ) and for the female , 907 g ( 32 oz ) . The Australian Poultry Standard and British Poultry Standard call for Silkie bantams much smaller ; in the Australian , the standard weights are 680 g ( 25 oz ) for males and 570 g ( 20 oz ) for females . The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g ( 22 oz ) for males , and 500 g for females ( 18 oz ) . = = = Polydactyly = = = Silkies are also known for their polydactyly , usually manifesting as an additional 1-2 digits in the foot . The genetic cause of this extra digit formation has been shown to be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene , called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence ( ZRS ) . This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud , leading to increased tissue growth and digits . Interestingly , while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly , the wings have the standard tridactyly ( three digit ) arrangement . The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo , but these are lost prior to hatching . The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed , which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER , with ectopic SHH a secondary effect . = = In cuisine = = The black meat of a Silkie is generally considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines . In contrast , several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food . Chinese cuisine especially values the breed , but it is also a common ingredient in some Japanese , Cambodian , Vietnamese and Korean dishes . Areas where Chinese cuisine has been a strong influence , such as Malaysia , may also cook Silkie . As early as the 7th century , traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food . The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make broth , braising , and in curries . Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as wolfberries , Dioscorea polystachya ( mountain yam ) , orange peel , and fresh ginger . A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or French cuisine , such as in confit .",

                    "text": "Horn shark = The horn shark ( Heterodontus francisci ) is a species of bullhead shark , in the family Heterodontidae . It is endemic to the coastal waters off the western coast of North America , from California to the Gulf of California . Young sharks are segregated spatially from the adults , with the former preferring deeper sandy flats and the latter preferring shallower rocky reefs or algal beds . A small species typically measuring 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) in length , the horn shark can be recognized by a short , blunt head with ridges over its eyes , two high dorsal fins with large spines , and a brown or gray coloration with many small dark spots . Slow-moving , generally solitary predators , horn sharks hunt at night inside small home ranges and retreat to a favored shelter during the day . Their daily activity cycles are controlled by environmental light levels . Adult sharks prey mainly on hard-shelled molluscs , echinoderms , and crustaceans , which they crush between powerful jaws and molar-like teeth , while also feeding opportunistically on a wide variety of other invertebrates and small bony fishes . Juveniles prefer softer-bodied prey such as polychaete worms and sea anemones . The shark extracts its prey from the substrate using suction and , if necessary , levering motions with its body . Reproduction is oviparous , with females laying up to 24 eggs from February to April . After laying , the female picks up the auger-shaped egg cases and wedges them into crevices to protect them from predators . Horn sharks are harmless unless harassed , and are readily maintained in captivity . They are not targeted by either commercial or recreational fisheries , though small numbers are caught as bycatch . In Mexico this species is used for food and fishmeal , and in California its spines are made into jewelry . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) does not yet have enough information to determine the horn shark 's conservation status . It faces few threats off the coast of the United States . = = Taxonomy = = The French biologist Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard published the first scientific description of the horn shark under the name Cestracion francisci in 1855 , in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia . This species was later placed in the genus Gyropleurodus , which was eventually synonymized with the genus Heterodontus . The specific epithet francisci is a reference to San Francisco , although the range of the horn shark does not extend that far north . The type specimen from Monterey Bay has since been lost . The scientific name for this species has been given erroneously as Heterodontus californicus . = = Description = = Like other bullhead sharks , the horn shark has a short , wide head with a blunt snout and prominent supraorbital ridges over the eyes . The horn shark 's supraorbital ridges are low and terminate abruptly ; the space between them on top of the head is deeply concave . Each eye lacks a nictating membrane and is followed by a tiny spiracle . The nostrils are split into inflow and outflow openings by a long flap that reaches the mouth . The inflow openings are encircled by a groove , while another groove connects the outflow openings to the mouth . The mouth is small and curved , with prominent furrows at the corners . There are 19 \u2013 26 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 18 \u2013 29 tooth rows in the lower jaw . The teeth at the front of the jaws are small and pointed , with a central cusp flanked by a pair of lateral cusplets ; those at the sides of the jaws are much larger , elongated lengthwise , and molar-like . The body is cylindrical , with two high , somewhat falcate ( sickle-shaped ) dorsal fins bearing stout spines at the front . The fin spines of reef-dwelling horn sharks are shorter than those living in algal habitats , as their spines become worn down on rocks from the sharks ' movements . The first dorsal fin originates over the bases of the large pectoral fins , while the second dorsal fin originates slightly anterior to the free rear tips of the pelvic fins . The caudal fin has a short lower lobe and a long , broad upper lobe with a strong notch near the tip . The horn shark 's dermal denticles are small and smooth , numbering some 200 / cm2 on the back in adults . The dorsal coloration consists of various shades of gray or brown with many small dark spots , though these may be absent in older sharks ; the underside is yellowish . There is a dark patch of small spots below the eye . This species may reach a length of 1.2 m ( 3.9 ft ) , though most individuals do not exceed 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) . = = Distribution and habitat = = The horn shark inhabits the continental shelf of the eastern Pacific Ocean , occurring off the coasts of California and Baja California from Monterey Bay southward , and in the Gulf of California . Uncommon influxes of warm water northward may bring it as far as San Francisco Bay . There are unconfirmed reports of this species off Ecuador and Peru , which may be misidentifications of other species . For most of the year , horn sharks are most common at a depth of 2 \u2013 11 m ( 6.6 \u2013 36.1 ft ) . At the onset of winter , they migrate to water deeper than 30 m ( 98 ft ) . This species has been found in caves as deep as 200 m ( 660 ft ) . Juvenile horn sharks between 35 \u2013 48 cm ( 1.15 \u2013 1.57 ft ) long prefer sandy flats with low vertical relief , in water 40 \u2013 150 m ( 130 \u2013 490 ft ) deep . They often take advantage of large feeding pits excavated by the bat ray ( Myliobatis californica ) for shelter and food . As they mature , horn sharks shift into shallower water and their preferred habitat becomes structurally complex rocky reefs or algae beds . This strongly benthic species seldom ventures more than 2 m ( 6.6 ft ) above the substrate . The relative abundances of the horn shark and the swellshark ( Centroscyllim ventriosum ) , which shares the same habitat , are negatively correlated because horn sharks prefer temperatures warmer than 20 \u00b0 C ( 68 \u00b0 F ) while swellsharks are more cold-tolerant . At Santa Catalina Island , a 20-year warming trend has resulted in an increase in the horn shark population and a decrease in the swellshark population . Horn sharks are less common than swellsharks in the northern Channel Islands , where the water is cooler . = = Biology and ecology = = The horn shark is a clumsy , sporadic swimmer that prefers to use its flexible , muscular pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom . It is usually solitary , though small groups have been recorded . During the day , horn sharks rest motionless , hidden inside caves or crevices , or within thick mats of algae , though they remain relatively alert and will swim away quickly if disturbed . After dusk , they roam actively above the reef in search of food . Horn sharks maintain small home ranges of around 1,000 m2 ( 11,000 sq ft ) , which they may remain faithful to for over a decade , returning to the same shelter every day . The shelter is usually located at the edge of the resident shark 's foraging area . The longest documented movement for an individual horn shark is 16 km ( 9.9 mi ) . Unlike most fishes , the daily activity pattern of the horn shark is under exogenous control , meaning that it is regulated by environmental factors rather than by an internal physiological cycle . Observations of captive horn sharks show that the relevant cue is light intensity : the sharks become active immediately after the lights are turned off , and stop as soon as they are turned back on . In one experiment where the sharks were kept in darkness , they remained continuously active for 11 days before slowing , possibly from fatigue . In nature , horn sharks exposed to a bright light at night may stop swimming and sink to the bottom . The horn shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and the northern elephant seal ( Mirounga angustirostris ) , which consumes adults , juveniles , and egg cases . In addition , they are captured and eaten by bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) at Catalina Island , and large marine snails are able to drill into their egg cases to extract the yolk . The tough skin and spines of this species confer some protection ; a Pacific angelshark ( Squatina californica ) has been filmed engulfing a juvenile horn shark , only to spit it out due to its spines . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bajaensis and Acanthobothrium puertecitense , the copepod Trebius heterodonti , and the nematode Echinocephalus pseudouncinatus , which spends its larval stage inside potential prey such as scallops and sea urchins . = = = Feeding = = = Some 95 % of the adult horn shark 's diet consists of hard-shelled mollusks ( e.g. bivalves and gastropods ) , echinoderms ( e.g. sea urchins ) and crustaceans ( e.g. crabs , shrimp , and isopods ) . To crack their shells , the horn shark generates the highest known bite force relative to its size of any shark , well in excess of other measured species such as the spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) and the blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus limbatus ) . One study found the average bite force for this species in the wild to be 95 N with a maximum of 135 N , while under experimental conditions sharks could be induced to bite with over 200 N of force . Large horn sharks that feed mainly on sea urchins ( particularly the short-spined purple urchin , Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) have their teeth and fin spines stained purple . Other prey items of adults include peanut worms , sea stars , cephalopods , and small bony fishes . Juveniles feed primarily on polychaete worms , sea anemones , and small clams , and have been known to \" pounce \" on anemones to bite off tentacles before they can be retracted . Off southern California , horn sharks are known to take advantage of seasonal opportunities . In the summer , diurnally active fishes , in particular the blacksmith ( Chromis punctipinnis ) , are especially abundant and are easily captured at night when they lie dormant . In the winter , the sharks scavenge on market squid ( Loligo opalescens ) , which die by the tens of thousands after their mass spawning event . Horn sharks hunt mainly using their sense of smell . Although electroreception certainly plays a role in locating prey , this species has only 148 ampullae of Lorenzini . This is much fewer than in most other sharks , which may have over 2,000 . Like other sharks , the horn shark 's teeth are regularly replaced ; it takes 4 weeks for a dropped tooth to be replaced . The horn shark captures prey via suction , created by expanding its buccal cavity . Its labial cartilages are modified so that the mouth can form a tube , facilitating the suction force . Once the prey is drawn into the mouth , it is secured with the sharp front teeth and then ground into pieces by the flat lateral teeth . To extract buried or affixed prey , the horn shark grips it and adopts a vertical posture with the head and pectoral fins against the substrate and the tail arched above . The shark then acts as a lever with its pectoral fins as the fulcrum : with a downward stroke of the tail , it forces its head upwards and pulls the prey loose ; this mode of feeding has not been observed in any other shark . The horn shark is also capable of protruding its upper jaw up to 15 % the length of its head ; this motion takes only 20 milliseconds to accomplish and allows the shark to use its upper jaw like a chisel to dislodge firmly attached prey . = = = Life history = = = Mating in the horn shark occurs in December or January , on a possibly annual reproductive cycle . The male chases the female to indicate interest ; once she is ready both sharks settle on the bottom , where the male grips the female 's pectoral fin in his teeth and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca . After 30 \u2013 40 minutes of copulation , the pair disengages and the female spins with her snout in the sand for another 30 minutes . From February to April , the females lay a maximum of 24 eggs two at a time once every 11 \u2013 14 days , in water 2 \u2013 13 m ( 6.6 \u2013 42.7 ft ) deep . The egg case has two flanges spiraling around it , and thus may take the female several hours to deposit . At first the case is soft and light brown , and over a few days it hardens and darkens in color . Not including the flanges , the case measures 10 \u2013 12 cm ( 3.9 \u2013 4.7 in ) long and 3 \u2013 4 cm ( 1.2 \u2013 1.6 in ) wide ; sharks from the Channel Islands produce longer egg cases than those from mainland California , suggesting that they are separate populations . One of the few sharks to exhibit parental care , female horn sharks in the wild pick up their eggs in their mouths and wedge them into crevices . However , in captivity the eggs are simply dropped on the bottom and may later be cannibalized . The eggs hatch in 6 \u2013 10 months ; at emergence the young measure 15 \u2013 17 cm ( 5.9 \u2013 6.7 in ) long . Newly hatched sharks are provisioned with an internal yolk sac and do not have to feed until they are a month old , though they are capable of feeding and will accept food during this period . Horn sharks grow slowly and at a highly variable rate that does not correspond to their size ; this has frustrated attempts to determine their aging process . Males mature at a length of 56 \u2013 61 cm ( 22 \u2013 24 in ) and females at a length of at least 58 cm ( 23 in ) . Individual sharks have lived to over 12 years old in captivity , and there exists an unconfirmed report of a shark reaching 25 years of age . = = Human interactions = = Under normal circumstances , horn sharks are harmless to humans and can readily be approached underwater . However , they can be provoked into biting , and some pugnacious individuals have been known to chase and bite divers after being harassed . These sharks should be handled with care as their fin spines can inflict a painful wound . The horn shark adapts well to captivity and has been maintained and bred in many public aquariums across the United States . The horn shark has no commercial value in California , where it is captured unintentionally in traps and trawls and by recreational anglers . The shark 's hardiness ensures that it can often be returned to the water alive . This species benefits from general restrictions placed on coastal fishing gear by the State of California . The average annual bycatch off California is 1,800 kg ( 4,000 lb ) , though historically it has varied from 2.5 kg ( 5.5 lb ) in 1976 to 9,500 kg ( 20,900 lb ) in 1979 . Divers sometimes kill them for sport or to make jewelry out of their fin spines , which may be the cause of a decline in the numbers of horn sharks in the most intensely dived areas of southern California . Off Mexico , this species is caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and demersal gillnets , and used for human consumption and fishmeal . The expansion of Mexican gillnet fisheries may pose a conservation concern in the future . At present , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) does not have sufficient information to assess the overall conservation status of this species ; its status in United States waters is likely Least Concern .",

                    "text": "Smoothtooth blacktip shark = The smoothtooth blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus leiodon ) is a species of requiem shark , in the family Carcharhinidae . It is known only from the type specimen caught from the Gulf of Aden , off eastern Yemen , and a handful of additional specimens caught from the Persian Gulf , off Kuwait . Reaching 1.2 m ( 3.9 ft ) in length , this species has a stocky greenish-colored body , a short snout , and black-tipped fins . It can be distinguished from similar species by its teeth , which are narrow , erect , and smooth-edged . Little is known of the smoothtooth blacktip shark 's natural history ; it likely inhabits shallow waters and feeds on small bony fishes . It is presumably viviparous like other members of its family . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) last assessed this species as Vulnerable , when only the sole type specimen was known . Although more specimens have since been discovered , the conservation status of this species remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range . = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = The first known specimen of the smoothtooth blacktip shark was a 75 cm ( 30 in ) long immature male caught by Wilhelm Hein in 1902 and deposited at the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna . The location was recorded as the Gulf of Aden near \" Gischin \" , which likely refers to the town of Qishn in eastern Yemen . In 1985 , the shark was examined and described as a new species by New Zealand ichthyologist Jack Garrick in a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) Technical Report . He gave it the specific epithet leiodon , from the Greek leios meaning \" smooth \" , and odon meaning \" tooth \" . This species was known only by the single specimen until 2008 , when fishery surveys in Kuwait uncovered several more specimens . Based on morphology , Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped the smoothtooth blacktip shark with the spinner shark ( C. brevipinna ) , the blacktip shark ( C. limbatus ) , the graceful shark ( C. amblyrhynchoides ) , and the finetooth shark ( C. isodon ) . Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences , Alec Moore and colleagues reported in 2011 that this species is closely related to the graceful shark , the blacktip shark , and the Australian blacktip shark ( C. tilstoni ) . = = Description = = Superficially , the smoothtooth blacktip shark resembles the blacktip reef shark ( C. melanopterus ) . It is rather robust in build , with a short and blunt snout . The large nostrils are preceded by well-developed , triangular flaps of skin . The small , circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes . The mouth forms a wide arch and has very short furrows at the corners . There are 16 upper and 14 \u2013 15 lower tooth rows on either side , along with two to three small teeth at the symphysis ( center ) of either jaw . The teeth are distinctive in shape , having narrow , upright cusps without serrations ; finetooth sharks and juvenile spinner sharks are the only other members of Carcharhinus with similar teeth . The five pairs of gill slits are long . The fairly long and pointed pectoral fins are slightly falcate ( sickle-shaped ) and originate between the fourth and fifth gill slits . The first dorsal fin is medium-sized and triangular with a pointed apex , and originates over the rear of the pectoral fin bases . The second dorsal fin is small and positioned opposite the anal fin . There is no ridge between the dorsal fins . The pelvic fins are triangular and larger than the anal fin , which has a deep notch in the trailing margin . A crescent-shaped notch is present on the caudal peduncle at the upper caudal fin origin . The caudal fin is asymmetrical , with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip . The dermal denticles are slightly overlapping and bear three prominent horizontal ridges leading to three or five marginal teeth . This species is greenish yellow to greenish gray above , sometimes with a scattering of tiny dark dots . The underside is white , which extends in a pale band onto the flanks . All the fins have sharply defined black tips , and there is a broad , dark midline stripe running from the second dorsal fin base to the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe . The largest recorded specimen is 1.2 m ( 3.9 ft ) long . = = Distribution and habitat = = The smoothtooth blacktip shark has only been recorded from eastern Yemen and Kuwait , some 3,000 km ( 1,900 mi ) apart . These two locations differ markedly : the Gulf of Aden near Yemen is over 2.5 km ( 1.6 mi ) deep with a narrow continental shelf and no permanent riverine inputs , while the Persian Gulf near Kuwait is entirely shallower than 40 m ( 130 ft ) and receives abundant freshwater from the Tigris-Euphrates-Karun river system . The Kuwait specimens were obtained from fish markets ; given the practices of Kuwaiti speedboat fishers , this shark can be supposed to inhabit shallow , coastal waters . Still , these waters encompass a range of habitats from estuaries to coral reefs , and thus the habitat requirements of the smoothtooth blacktip shark remain largely unknown . = = Biology and ecology = = Considering its resemblance to the blacktip reef shark , the smoothtooth blacktip shark may play an equivalent shallow-water ecological role within its range . It is known to feed on marine catfish , and its diet probably also includes other small bony fishes . This species is presumably viviparous like all other Carcharhinus species , with the developing young sustained to term by a placental connection to the mother . Judging from the available specimens , males reach sexual maturity at some point between 0.9 and 1.2 m ( 3.0 and 3.9 ft ) long . = = Human interactions = = Prior to the finding of additional specimens in Kuwait , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) assessed the smoothtooth blacktip shark as Vulnerable based on its presumed small range and population . Despite the discovery of a second subpopulation off Kuwait , this species likely still warrants a Vulnerable assessment ( or higher ) because the waters around the Arabian Peninsula are subject to heavy fishing pressure and habitat degradation . Gillnet and other fisheries off Kuwait are known to take the smoothtooth blacktip shark as bycatch , while intensive Yemeni and Somalian shark fisheries operate in the Gulf of Aden . The status of the Yemen subpopulation is uncertain because no further specimens have been recorded since the original over a century ago .",

                    "text": "Granny ( orca ) = Granny , also known as J2 , is an orca , or killer whale , estimated by some whale researchers to be 105 years old , which , if correct , would make her the oldest known living orca . Granny had been captured with the rest of her pod in 1967 but was too old at that time for a marine mammal park , so was released . In 1967 , Granny was estimated to have been born in 1911 . = = Description = = Granny is recognizable from the gray \" saddle patch \" just behind her dorsal fin , and a half-moon notch in her fin . Simon Pidcock of Ocean EcoVentures said he has seen Granny thousands of times , and that the markings on orca fins are like fingerprints . Now that orca studies have been going on for several decades , the exact age of many whales is known . The age of older orcas , such as Granny , is estimated by their offspring ; they give birth around age 15 , and stop having offspring around 40 ; by adding the generations together , ages can be estimated . There are also photographs of Granny from the 1930s and the size and growth of Granny and the other orcas is also used in the age estimates . In Granny 's case , she was photographed in 1971 with a male orca , J1 Ruffles , who was thought to be Granny 's son . Ruffles was estimated as at least 20 years old , and as scientists believed him to be Granny 's last offspring , her own age was estimated at about 60 . However , it was later determined through DNA that Ruffles was not Granny 's son . = = J pod = = Granny , along with several of her descendants , travels in the J pod , a group of about 25 orcas . J pod , along with Pods K and L , are the \" J clan \" , which is part of the southern resident killer whale population . They frequent the inland waters of British Columbia and Washington State in the summer months , but roam from southeast Alaska to central California . They have completed a journey as far as 800 miles in a week . A well-known male orca thought to be Granny 's son is J1 Ruffles . He was last seen in 2010 . According to researchers , Granny also has multiple grandchildren and great-grandchildren travelling in the pod with her . The southern resident killer whales are the most studied population of killer whales in the world . Many whales in this population were captured in the 1960s and 1970s for use in sea parks , and others were killed by hunters attempting to capture them . = = Legacy = = As the oldest known orca , Granny is used in arguments against keeping whales in captivity , referencing the allegedly reduced lifespan of whales in captivity . The oldest orca in captivity is the 50-year-old Lolita who is at the Miami Seaquarium . The average lifespan for a captured orca is 20 to 30 years . Of Granny 's age , Captain Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching said \" [ ... ] it \u2019 s mind-blowing to think that this whale is over 100 years old . She was born before the Titanic went down . Can you imagine the things she \u2019 s seen in her lifetime ? \" Granny was also used as a focal point of environmental efforts that resulted in the Endangered Species Act protections for orca . Environmentalists estimate that Granny may have a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million , and that her descendants ' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution . Additionally , Granny and her family are at risk from declining West Coast salmon populations . Granny was featured in a children 's book on orcas titled Granny 's Clan : A Tale of Wild Orcas by Sally Hodson . = = Orca lifespan = = Estimates of lifespans for wild orcas vary . Seaworld says wild lifespans are 30 \u2013 50 years for females , and 19 \u2013 30 years for males . These estimates are similar to the estimates from a 2005 study . Marine conservation groups argue that these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting , pollution , and capture on the wild populations , and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans , with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years ) .",

It was named after German botanist Heinrich Zollinger , who researched the genus Clavaria , and collected the type specimen in Java , Indonesia . L\u00e9veill\u00e9 considered the dichotomous branching to be the prominent characteristic that separated this species from the otherwise similar Clavaria amethystina . American Charles Horton Peck published a species collected from Stow , Massachusetts as Clavaria lavendula in 1910 , but this is a synonym . The mushroom is commonly known as the \" violet coral \" , or the \" magenta coral \" . In a 1978 classification of the genus Clavaria , Ronald Petersen placed C. zollingeri in the subgenus Clavaria , a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body ; others in the subgenus included C. purpurea , C. fumosa , and the type , C. vermicularis . A large-scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions and limits of clavarioid fungi in the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn Dentiger and David McLaughlin in 2006 . Based on their analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences , C. zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis laeticolor . Petersen 's concept of the infrageneric classification of Clavaria was largely rejected in this analysis , as two of the three subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic . = = Description = = The coloring of the fruit bodies is quite variable , ranging from violet to amethyst , or violet shaded with brown or red . The colors may be variable over the fruit body ; in one instance the outside branches were brown while the inner branches in the center of the bundle were light violet . Dried specimens may lose their coloring almost entirely , as the pigments may be sensitive to light or dryness . The fruit body is typically 5 to 10 cm ( 2.0 to 3.9 in ) tall and 4 to 7 cm ( 1.6 to 2.8 in ) wide . The stem , or base , is short , and the branching starts a short distance above the ground . The surfaces of the fragile branches are smooth and dry ; the branches are 2 \u2013 6 thick , typically with rounded tips . It has no distinguishable odor , and a taste somewhat like radishes or cucumber . Although edible in small quantities , the fragile fruit bodies are of limited culinary value , and may have a laxative effect . In mass , the spores ( produced on the surface of the branches ) are white . Light microscopy reveals additional details : the spores are roughly spherical to broadly elliptical , with dimensions of 4 \u2013 7 by 3 \u2013 5 \u03bcm . They have a clear apiculus about 1 \u03bcm long , and a single large oil droplet . The basidia ( spore-bearing cells ) are four-spored , do not have clamps , and measure 50 \u2013 60 by 7 \u2013 9 \u03bcm , gradually widening at the apex . = = = Similar species = = = Other lavender to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides , which is so multiply branched so as to appear toothed , and Clavulina amethystina , which can only be reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species . In Alloclavaria purpurea , the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple . The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger , but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color as the rest of the fruit body . Ramariopsis pulchella \u2014 a small , violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than 3 cm ( 1.2 in ) \u2014 could be mistaken for a small C. zollingeri . It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0 \u2013 4.5 by 2.5 \u2013 3.5 \u03bcm . = = Habitat and distribution = = The fruit bodies of Clavaria zollingeri grow either solitarily , in groups , or in clusters on the ground in grassy spots , usually near hardwood trees , or with mosses . It is a saprobic species , deriving nutrients by breaking down organic matter . It has a widespread distribution , and has been found in Australia , New Zealand , North America , South America , and Asia ( including Brunei , India , and Korea ) . In North America , the distribution is restricted to the northeastern regions of the continent . Rare in Europe , it is listed in the Red Lists of threatened species in Denmark and Great Britain . In Ireland , it is used as an indicator species to help assess the fungal diversity of nutrient-poor grasslands , a habitat under threat . It was recorded from the Netherlands for the first time in 2006 . = = Bioactive compounds = = Clavaria zollingeri contains lectins , a class of proteins that bind specific carbohydrates on the surface of cells , causing them to clump together . A Korean study demonstrated that extracts of the fungus caused lymphoagglutination , a specific form of agglutination that involves white blood cells . In general , lectins are used in blood typing and serology , and they are widely used in affinity chromatography for purifying proteins .",

                    "text": "American bittern = The American bittern ( Botaurus lentiginosus ) is a species of wading bird of the heron family ( Ardeidae ) . It has a Nearctic distribution , breeding in Canada and the northern and central parts of the United States , and wintering in the southern United States , the Caribbean islands and parts of Central America . It is a well-camouflaged , solitary brown bird that unobtrusively inhabits marshes and the coarse vegetation at the edge of lakes and ponds . In the breeding season it is chiefly noticeable by the loud , booming call of the male . The nest is built just above the water , usually among bulrushes and cattails , where the female incubates the clutch of olive-buff eggs for about four weeks . The young leave the nest after two weeks and are fully fledged at six or seven weeks . The American bittern feeds mostly on fish , but also eats other small vertebrates as well as crustaceans and insects . It is fairly common over its wide range but its numbers are thought to be decreasing , especially in the south , due to habitat degradation . However the total population is large , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \" Least Concern \" . = = Description = = The American bittern is a large , chunky , brown bird , very similar to the Eurasian bittern ( Botaurus stellaris ) , though slightly smaller , and the plumage is speckled rather than being barred . It is 58 \u2013 85 cm ( 23 \u2013 33 in ) in length , with a 92 \u2013 115 cm ( 36 \u2013 45 in ) wingspan and a body mass of 370 \u2013 1,072 g ( 0.816 \u2013 2.363 lb ) . The crown is chestnut-brown with the centers of the feathers being black . The side of the neck has a bluish-black elongated patch which is larger in the male than in the female . The hind neck is olive and the mantle and scapulars are dark chestnut-brown , barred and speckled with black , some feathers being edged with buff . The back , rump and upper tail-coverts are similar in color but more-finely speckled with black and with grey bases to the feathers . The tail feathers are chestnut-brown , with speckled edges , and the primaries and secondaries are blackish-brown with buff or chestnut tips . The cheeks are brown and there is a buff superciliary stripe and a similarly colored mustachial stripe . The chin is creamy-white with a chestnut central stripe , and the feathers of the throat , breast and upper belly are buff and rust-colored , finely outlined with black , giving a striped effect to the underparts . The eye is surrounded by yellowish skin and the iris is pale yellow . The long , robust bill is yellowish-green , the upper mandible being darker than the lower , and the legs and feet are also yellowish-green . Juveniles resemble adults but the sides of their necks are less olive . = = Taxonomy = = The American bittern was first described in 1813 by the English clergyman Thomas Rackett from a vagrant individual he examined in Dorset , England . No subspecies are accepted today , however , fossils found in the Ichetucknee River , Florida , and originally described as a new form of heron ( Palaeophoyx columbiana ; McCoy , 1963 ) were later recognized to be a smaller , prehistoric subspecies of the American bittern which lived during the Late Pleistocene ( Olson , 1974 ) and would thus be called B. l. columbianus . Its closest living relative is the pinnated bittern ( Botaurus pinnatus ) from Central and South America . The generic name Botaurus was given by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens , and is derived from Medieval Latin butaurus , \" bittern \" , itself constructed from the Middle English name for the Eurasian bittern , botor . Pliny gave a fanciful derivation from Bos ( ox ) and taurus ( bull ) , because the bittern 's call resembles the bellowing of a bull . The species name lentiginosus is Latin for \" freckled \" , from lentigo , \" freckle \" , and refers to the speckled plumage . Many of the folk names are given for its distinctive call ; In his book on the common names of American birds , Ernest Choate lists \" bog bumper \" and \" stake driver \" , and other vernacular names include \" thunder pumper \" and \" bog bull \" . = = Distribution and habitat = = The range of this bittern includes much of North America . It breeds in southern Canada as far north as British Columbia , the Great Slave Lake and Hudson Bay , and in much of the United States and possibly central Mexico . It migrates southward in the fall and overwinters in the southern United States , the Caribbean Islands and Mexico , with past records also coming from Panama and Costa Rica . As a long-distance migrant , it is a very rare vagrant in Europe , including Great Britain and Ireland . It is an aquatic bird and frequents bogs , marshes and the thickly-vegetated verges of shallow-water lakes and ponds , both with fresh and brackish or saline water . It sometimes feeds out in the open in wet meadows and pastures . = = Behavior = = The American bittern is a solitary bird , and although common in much of its range , usually keeps itself well-hidden and is difficult to observe . It usually hunts by walking stealthily in shallow water and among the vegetation , stalking its prey , but sometimes stands still , in ambush . If it senses that it has been seen , the American bittern remains motionless , with its bill pointed upward , its cryptic coloration causing it to blend into the surrounding foliage . It is mainly nocturnal and is most active at dusk . More often heard than seen , the male bittern has a loud , booming call that resembles a congested pump , and which has been rendered as \" oong , kach , oonk \" . While uttering this sound , the bird 's head is thrown convulsively upward and then forward , and the sound is repeated up to seven times . The exact process by which the bittern makes its distinctive sound is not fully understood . It has been suggested that the bird gradually puffs out its neck by inflating its esophagus with air accompanied by a mild clicking or hiccuping sound . The esophagus is kept inflated by means of flaps beside the tongue . Once this action is completed and the esophagus is fully inflated , the distinctive gulping sound is made in the syrinx . When the sound is finished , the bird deflates its oesophagus . Like other members of the heron family , the American bittern feeds in marshes and shallow ponds , preying mainly on fish , but also consuming amphibians , reptiles , small mammals , crustaceans and insects . It is a territorial bird and has a threat display which involves slowly erecting long , white , previously-concealed , plumes on its shoulders , to form wing-like extensions that nearly meet across its back , resembling a ruff . The bird then stands still in a threatening posture , or stalks the intruder in a crouching position , with its head retracted and a gliding gait . This bird nests solitarily in marshes among coarse vegetation such as bulrushes ( Scirpus ) and cattails , with the female building the nest and the male guarding it . The nest is usually about 15 cm ( 6 in ) above the water surface and consists of a rough platform of dead stalks and rushes , sometimes with a few twigs mixed in , and lined with bits of coarse grass . Up to about six eggs are laid and are incubated by the female for twenty-nine days . The eggs are bluntly ovoid in shape , olive-buff and unspeckled , averaging 49 by 37 mm ( 1.93 by 1.46 in ) in size . The chicks are fed individually , each in turn pulling down the female 's beak , and receiving regurgitated food directly into its beak . They leave the nest at about two weeks and are fully-fledged at six to seven weeks . = = Status = = This bird 's numbers are declining in many parts of its range due to habitat loss . This is particularly noticeable in the southern part where chemical contamination and human development are reducing the area of suitable habitat . However , the bird has an extremely large range and a large total population , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \" Least Concern \" . The American bittern is protected under the United States Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 . It is also protected under the Canadian Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1994 to which both Canada and the United States are signatories .",

                    "text": "Mycena californiensis = Mycena californiensis is a species of fungus in the Mycenaceae family . It is a common and abundant species in the coastal oak woodlands of California , where it grows saprobically , feeding on the fallen leaves and acorns of various oak species . First described in 1860 by Berkeley and Curtis , the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition . It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later Mycena researchers , until a 1999 publication validated the taxon . Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym . Making their appearance in late autumn to early winter , the small and fragile fruit bodies are characterized by reddish-brown tones in the cap , stem , and the edges of the gills . If cut , the mushroom tissue will \" bleed \" a deep reddish to orangish latex . As is typical of the genus Mycena , caps of M. californiensis are bluntly conical , becoming bell-shaped to convex , and eventually flatten out when old . They measure up to 2 cm ( 0.8 in ) in diameter , and are attached to thin , hollow stems that are up to 13 cm ( 5.1 in ) long . = = History and taxonomy = = The species was originally collected for science purposes by the American botanist Charles Wright during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition of 1853 \u2013 56 . The single collection was found growing on fallen oak leaves at Mare Island Naval Shipyard , in Solano County , California in January 1856 . The specimen was sent by American mycologist Moses Ashley Curtis to his British colleague Miles Joseph Berkeley , who published a brief description of the species in 1860 , calling it Agaricus californiensis , in what was then the subgenus Mycena . Berkeley and Curtis noted that it differed from A. aurantio-marginatus ( known today as Mycena aurantiomarginata ) in the nature of the gills , and they called it \" a more graceful species . \" In his 1887 Sylloge Fungorum , Pier Andrea Saccardo raised the subgenus Mycena to generic status , so the species became known as Mycena californiensis . In his 1947 monograph of North American Mycena , Alexander H. Smith included it as an \" excluded or doubtful species \" , saying that the species \" cannot be recognized until the microscopic characters of the type are known . \" Researching his 1982 monograph of Mycena , Maas Geesteranus examined the holotype material \u2014 the particular specimen designated by Berkeley and Curtis to represent the type of the species . Because of its deteriorated condition , however , he was unable to corroborate the distinguishing features proposed by Berkeley and Curtis , and he agreed with Smith 's assessment of the species . In the late 1990s , as part of his studies on the Mycena of California , Brian Perry noted that a common species in California , usually referred to as Mycena elegantula or M. sanguinolenta , presented characteristics not congruent with either ( in particular , M. elegantula had not previously been reported to contain latex ) . He compared isotype material ( material collected at the same time and place as the holotype ) of M. californiensis with Californian specimens and the type of M. elegantula and found all of them to represent the same species , publishing the results with Dennis Desjardin in their 1999 Mycotaxon article \" Mycena californiensis resurrected \" . Part of the confusion , they noted , was apparently due to Smith 's concept of M. elegantula not agreeing with the species ' type ( something also noticed by Geesteranus ) . Because M. californiensis is the earlier name ( published in 1860 vs. 1895 for Mycena elegantula ) , it has priority over the later name M. elegantula , according to the rules of botanical nomenclature . = = Description = = The cap of M. californiensis is initially conic or bell-shaped , but flattens out in maturity , and typically reaches dimensions of up to 2 cm ( 0.8 in ) . The cap margins ( edges ) are curved inwards when young , but as they age they become wavy or crenate ( with rounded scallops ) , develop striations ( radial grooves ) and may even split . The surface of the cap is dull and smooth . Its color ranges from reddish-brown to brownish-orange in young specimens , with the color fading as the mushroom matures ; the center of the cap is usually darker than the margins . The flesh is thin , and either the same color as the cap or ligher ; it may stain a dark red color when bruised . The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem \u2014 broadly attached slightly above the bottom of the gill , with most of the gill fused to the stem . They are not closely spaced together , and there are about 15 \u2013 20 of them . Some of the gills do not extend the full distance from the edge of the cap to the stem . These short gills , called lamellulae , form one to two groups of roughly equal length . All of the gills have a white to pinkish-buff color , with the gill edges ranging from reddish-orange to reddish-brown to brownish-orange . The hollow stem is 29 \u2013 130 mm ( 1.1 \u2013 5.1 in ) long by 1 \u2013 3 mm ( 0.04 \u2013 0.12 in ) thick , and roughly the same thickness throughout . The top of the stem may be either pruinose ( appearing to be covered with a very fine whitish powder on a surface ) or smooth , while the stem base is covered with \" hairs \" that may be strigose ( large , coarse , and bristle-like ) to downy ( soft and fuzzy ) . The stem is some shade of brown . The mushroom tissue will \" bleed \" a brownish-range to reddish brown latex when it is cut . The edibility of M. californiensis is unknown . = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = In deposit , such as with a spore print , the spores appear white . Further details are revealed with a light microscope : the spores are ellipsoid to almond-shaped , smooth , thin-walled , and measure 8 \u2013 12 by 4 \u2013 6 \u00b5m . The basidia ( the spore-bearing cells ) are club-shaped , four-spored , and typically have dimensions of 26 \u2013 37.5 by 7 \u2013 10.5 \u00b5m . M. californiensis has cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edges ) that measure 16 \u2013 50 by 6.5 \u2013 20 \u00b5m . These cells have irregular projections that can range in size from 1.5 \u2013 18.8 by 1.5 \u2013 6.5 \u00b5m and are variously shaped , from knob-like to cylindrical . The cells contain brownish contents that will stain darkly with Melzer 's reagent , a common chemical reagent used in mushroom identification . With the exception of the medullary hyphae of the stem ( longitudinally-arranged hyphae making up the stem surface ) , all hyphae contain clamp connections . = = = Similar species = = = Mycena californiensis may be distinguished from the closely related M. atromarginata by its smaller size and the purplish tint to the edge of the gills , and from M. purpureofusca by its differently shaped , longer spores . Another Mycena commonly confused with M. californiensis is M. sanguinolenta , a species that also exudes reddish latex . It can be distinguished from M. californiensis by the fusiform ( tapering at each end ) cheilocystidia that do not have outgrowths . An additional difference between the two is that M. sanguinolenta is associated with conifer wood and debris . = = Habitat and distribution = = The fruit bodies grow in clusters or scattered on the decomposing leaves and acorns of oak trees , such as Coast Live Oak , Valley Oak and Black Oak . It is common in the coastal oak woodlands of California , where it appears from late autumn to early winter .",

Her younger sister was Jacqueline ' Jackie ' Dykins ( born 26 October 1949 ) . Lennon started visiting the Dykins ' house in 1951 . After the death of Julia Lennon in 1958 , Harriet and Norman Birch were appointed guardians of Julia and Jackie , ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married their mother . Lennon invited the Dykins sisters to visit after the success of the Beatles , when he was living in Kenwood , Weybridge , with his then-wife , Cynthia Lennon . Julia Dykins ( Baird ) married Allen Baird in 1968 and moved to Belfast . They had three children together but were divorced in 1981 . Baird worked as a special needs teacher , and after Lennon 's death she wrote John Lennon , My Brother ( with Geoffrey Giuliano ) and gave up working in 2004 to write Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon . She is now a director of Cavern City Tours in Liverpool . = = Early years = = Baird 's mother , Julia Lennon , was the fourth of five children in the Stanley family : Mary , known as ' Mimi ' ( 1906 \u2013 1991 ) , Elizabeth ' Mater ' ( 1908 \u2013 1976 ) , Anne ' Nanny ' ( 1911 \u2013 1988 ) , Julia ' Judy ' ( 1914 \u2013 1958 ) , and Harriet ' Harrie ' ( 1916 \u2013 1972 ) . John Lennon was Julia 's first child by Alfred Lennon , although she later had a daughter called Victoria ( renamed Ingrid ) after an affair with a Welsh soldier while Alfred was at sea . Julia was forced to give up the child for adoption after intense pressure from her father and her sisters . Although they had known each other previously , Julia started dating Dykins while working in a caf\u00e9 near Mosspits , which was Lennon 's primary school . Dykins was said to be a good-looking , well-dressed man who was several years older than Julia and worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward . Julia later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins , who had access to rationed goods like alcohol , chocolate , silks and cigarettes . The Stanley sisters called Dykins a \" spiv \" , because of his pencil-thin moustache , margarine-coated hair , and pork-pie hat , but the young Lennon called him \" Twitchy \" because of a physical tic and nervous cough Dykins had . Although Julia never divorced Alfred Lennon , she was the common-law wife of Dykins , although Paul McCartney admitted to being sarcastic to Lennon about his mother living in sin while Julia was still married . Julia 's sister , Mimi , called Julia and Dykins ' home \u2014 at 1 Blomfield Road , Liverpool \u2014 \" The House of Sin \" and her own house ( where Lennon lived ) \" The House of Correction \" . When Jackie was born prematurely on 26 October 1949 , Julia went back to the hospital every day to see her , although she was often not allowed ( by Mimi ) to visit Lennon . Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool , which allowed Julia to stay at home at Blomfield Road , to look after Baird , Jackie , a cat named \" Elvis \" , and the 11-year-old Lennon , who had started to visit and occasionally stayed overnight . Baird would give up her bed to Lennon , and share Jackie 's double bed . Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money ( one shilling ) for doing odd jobs , such as collecting golf balls on the local course , on top of the five shillings that Lennon 's Aunt Mimi gave him . During Lennon 's visits , he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie , test Baird 's spelling , and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend . Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them , her mother would often play a record called , My Son John , To Me You Are So Wonderful , \" by some old crooner , and sit and listen to it \" . \" My Son John \" \u2014 sung by David Whitfield \u2014 was released in 1956 . Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt 's croft in Sango Bay , Durness , Scotland , for his holidays , he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family . Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street , Liverpool , to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen on the back of a flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957 . Baird was allowed to sit on the back , but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off . The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool 's charter by King John . Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road because they said the acoustics \" sounded like a recording studio \" . = = = Legal guardian = = = Baird 's mother was struck and killed on 15 July 1958 , just outside Mimi 's home , by a Standard Vanguard car driven by an off-duty constable , PC Eric Clague , who was a learner-driver . Clague later said : \" Mrs Lennon just ran straight out in front of me . I just couldn 't avoid her . I was not speeding , I swear it . It was just one of those terrible things that happen . \" Baird and Jackie ( aged eleven and eight respectively ) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater 's , and were not allowed to attend the funeral . They were told two months later by Norman Birch ( Lennon 's uncle ) that their mother had died . Lennon 's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls \u2014 ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married Julia . Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool . Her grave is unmarked , and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . Baird and Jackie were taken to live with the Birches and their son at The Dairy Cottage , which was owned by Mimi 's husband , George Smith . At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself , where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House , although Baird and her friends called it \" frothy coffee \" . At 16 , Baird started to hitch-hike to London , although her Aunt never knew , as she would never have allowed it . Baird talked about the trips to London , and how relatively safe they were : \" Hitching was easy then . It was a way of life . Everything was becoming more free . We 'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties . People always gave us a place to stay \u2013 we were never harmed . \" Baird and Jackie were asked to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964 . Cynthia Lennon \u2014 Lennon 's wife at the time \u2014 took them both out shopping in Knightsbridge , buying them expensive clothes . During the same visit , The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria , and the sisters asked to be allowed to stand near the front , but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush . In December 1965 , Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane . Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards . Dykins had married again , but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife , and did not attend their father 's funeral . In 1968 , Lennon was told The Dairy Cottage was too cramped for them all , so he told Birch to buy a house , and he found a 4-bedroom house in Gateacre Park Drive , Liverpool . Lennon told Birch to furnish and decorate it , and to send all the bills to him . The Dykinses heard nothing from Lennon for years , until he phoned Baird in 1975 , and asked for mementos of his childhood life , such as his school tie and photographs . He sent \u00a3 3,000 to cover the cost of shipping and as a gift , but wrote , \" Don 't tell Mimi \" . Lennon continued to call Baird until 1976 , when the calls stopped . Jackie worked as a shop assistant during the 1970s , but battled against a heroin addiction . In the 1980s , and fully recovered , Jackie gave birth to her son , John , later working as a hairstylist . After Lennon and Harriet died , Yoko Ono wanted to sell the house \u2014 as it was still in Lennon 's name \u2014 but later gave it to the Salvation Army on 2 November 1993 , even though Lennon had once written : \" I always thought of the house he 's in [ Birch ] as my contribution towards looking after Julia [ Baird ] and Jackie . I would prefer the girls to use it . \" = = Later years = = Julia married Allen Baird in 1968 , they moved to Belfast and kept her family history a secret . The Bairds had three children : Nicholas ( b . 1971 ) , Sara ( b . 1972 ) and David ( b . 1980 ) , and were divorced in 1981 . Baird went to university and gained an MA in philosophy of education , and during her the course of her degree she spent a year off in France , hitch-hiked around Europe , and protested against the war in Vietnam in Paris alongside Simone de Beauvoir . Baird later taught French and English before working as a special needs teacher with teenagers in deprived areas of Chester , until she retired to write books and become a director of Cavern City Tours . Baird and Jackie met their half-sister Ingrid Pedersen for the first time when they were present at the ceremony to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi 's house , commemorating the fact that Lennon had lived there . Baird and Jackie had only recently found out who Pedersen was , after being told by journalist Bill Smithies of the Liverpool Echo . Baird was shocked that Pedersen did not look anything like the Stanley or the Lennon family , having pale blue eyes and fair hair . After releasing the book , John Lennon , My Brother \u2014 written with Giuliano , and a foreword by McCartney \u2014 Baird travelled to New York during 1989 to appear at a Beatlefest convention , and was asked if she could prove she was really Lennon 's half-sister . Baird declined , saying she was not going to produce her passport , and the audience would just have to take her word for it . In 2000 , Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs , erected on major routes into Liverpool , saying , \" Liverpool welcomes you \u2013 to the birthplace of THE BEATLES \" , and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool 's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon 's birthday . Baird retired in 2004 , and published a book called Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon , in February 2007 . From 28 to 30 September 2007 , Durness held the John Lennon Northern Lights Festival which was attended by Baird ( who read from Lennon 's writings and her own books ) and Stanley Parkes ( Lennon 's Scottish cousin ) . Parkes said , \" Me and Julia [ Baird ] are going to be going to the old family croft to tell stories \" . Musicians , painters and poets from across the UK performed at the festival . Baird now lives in Chester with her partner , Roger Keys . Baird claims she was never told that her mother was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool , although the graveyard 's location is approximately 1.19 miles east of 1 Blomfield Road . The grave was unmarked , but was recently identified as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . The Stanley family finally put a headstone on her mother 's grave . The headstone reads : Mummy John Victoria Julie Jackie .",

I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks.

                    "text": "Wonder World Tour ( Miley Cyrus ) = The Wonder World Tour is the second concert tour by American recording artist Miley Cyrus . The tour was held to promote her second studio album Breakout ( 2008 ) and first extended play ( EP ) The Time of Our Lives ( 2009 ) . It began in September 2009 and concluded in December 29 , visiting cities in the United States and United Kingdom ; thus , the Wonder World Tour became Cyrus ' first world tour . It also became Cyrus ' first tour not to incorporate performances as Hannah Montana . Alternative band Metro Station served as opening act for all tour venues . It was sponsored by Wal-Mart and promoted by AEG Live . All tickets from the Wonder World Tour were sold using paperless ticketing , in order to prevent ticket scalping similar to what had occurred during Cyrus ' previous tour . One dollar from each ticket sold was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center , an organization devoted to the fight against cancer . The Wonder World Tour has been described as part of Cyrus ' transitional period , with more elaborate and edgier characteristics . Each concert was divided into seven segments , each of which bared different themes , the subject of matter for the tour 's title . The show opened with Cyrus performing rock-oriented songs . It also featured her and backup dancers being suspended above the stage with aerial rigging various times . At one point , she mounted a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as it was elevated and made its path across the venue . Cyrus also rendered a tribute to the deceased singer Michael Jackson and performed two Hannah Montana-credited songs as herself . The tour received positive to mixed reception from critics . Some praised it and deemed it a spectacle , while others believed it lacked profundity and portrayal of Cyrus ' personality . The Wonder World Tour was commercially successful despite the financial recession that was present in 2009 . It was able to sell-out all European dates in ten minutes and marks the largest attendance at The O2 Arena in London . During the first leg of the tour , one bus overturned several times on a highway . The accident resulted in the injury of one person and the death of another . The cause of the accident is yet to be specified , yet multiple theories for it exist . A filtered version of the Wonder World Tour was broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) on June 18 , 2010 and received a total of over 2.6 million viewers . The full-length concert film was released on the limited , deluxe edition of Cyrus ' third studio album Can 't Be Tamed ( 2010 ) . = = Background = = Cyrus is a singer-songwriter and actress who starred on the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana as Miley Stewart , a girl with a secret double life as the popstar Hannah Montana . Through the television series , Cyrus developed fame as a teen idol and released music credited to Hannah Montana . Cyrus ' debut studio album , titled Meet Miley Cyrus , was released as the second disc of the Hannah Montana 2 / Meet Miley Cyrus ( 2007 ) double-disc album . In order to promote the album , Cyrus embarked on her first tour , the Best of Both Worlds Tour ( 2007 \u2013 08 ) , a North American tour where she performed both under character , as Hannah Montana , and as herself . With the release of Cyrus ' second studio album , Breakout ( 2008 ) , her first not be affiliated with the Hannah Montana franchise , and an extended play ( EP ) The Time of Our Lives ( 2009 ) , Cyrus decided to embark on tour again with the Wonder World Tour , however , without incorporating performances as Hannah Montana , a step which the media interpreted as furthering her distance from the Hannah Montana franchise . The concert tour was announced alongside Cyrus ' joint apparel line with Max Azria on June 3 , 2009 , through various outlets , including Miley ' Twitter account , a press release , and MileyWorld , Cyrus ' official fan club . It was confirmed that the tour would be sponsored by American retailing company Wal-Mart and promoted by AEG Live . It would expand throughout the United States , from September 14 , 2009 in Portland , Oregon to December 2 , 2009 in Miami , Florida , with a total of forty-five dates . Alternative rock band Metro Station , where Cyrus ' older brother , Trace Cyrus , integrates in , was confirmed as the opening act for all dates . Two days later , a European leg , with nine dates in the United Kingdom , was announced , marking Cyrus ' first concerts to visit another continent . On June 16 , 2009 , two more dates were annexed , and one final date was annexed in October 2009 , in order to meet demand . All tickets for the Wonder World Tour were sold exclusively through paperless ticket delivery , meaning that fans did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event . Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card used to make the purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry . All groups were to enter the concert together , and ushers issued seat locator slips . The method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time , although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC / DC 's Black Ice World Tour ( 2008 \u2013 10 ) . However , it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing . This was done in response to the extensive ticket scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour and in order to give fans the opportunity to purchase good tickets at face value . Cyrus ' manager and president of Morey Management Group , Jason Morey , stated , \" The focus was , ' How do we take all the information we gathered last time out and do a better job of it ? ' It was important to us to address the issue of demand . We thought that of every single option that was available out there , this was a really viable option , to go with the paperless ticketing . \" As with the Best of Both Worlds Tour , one dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center , a center dedicated to the prevention , treatment and research for the cure of cancer . = = Development = = The tour was titled the Wonder World Tour because of its diversity in themes and styles . Cyrus believed the tour was good transition for solidifying a more rock music-based career . She described the tour to be edgy and \" more of a mature show \" , with the target audience being teenagers relatively her age , which was sixteen at the time . However , performances that would please younger audiences were added to the setlist . It was conceptualized to be a more elaborate than Cyrus ' previous tour and to reflect Cyrus as an individual . The reason for this to occur was because Cyrus felt more confident as a vocalist to perform stunts and use props while singing . Also , more resources were available , for more companies were willing to invest in the tour . Ideas were suggested by different individuals and were tested during filmed rehearsals in order to decide which would make the final cut . \" Each person has their own character and their own story . So , we 've added everyone 's kind of specialty into our show [ ... ] This is not just a concert , it is an absolute show \" , Cyrus said . After having completed filming for The Last Song ( 2010 ) in Tybee Island , Georgia , Cyrus returned to Los Angeles for tour rehearsals at The Forum in mid-August . Due to filming The Last Song , Cyrus was only able to rehearse for three weeks although the average rehearsal period for musicians is about three months . Jammal Simms was hired as the tour 's director and main choreographer . Octavious Terry served as an assistant for directing , meanwhile Dondraico Johnson assisted choreography . They , along with twelve other members , composed the tour 's creative team . In total , the Wonder World Tour included 124 traveling workers , 19 truckloads of equipment , and 15 buses . The stage was quite different from that of the Best of Both Worlds Tour . It consisted of a rectangular main stage , which featured staircases that elevated the center of the stage , and a narrow runway , which connected the main stage to a B-stage that ran the length of the main stage . Regarding the stage , Cyrus noted that it was \" something not many people get to have . I 'm able to move around to each side so there 's no one person who feels like they don 't have the best seat . Every seat is the best seat . \" Six LED multi-screen video units were located throughout the stage ; the three largest were placed as the upstage wall , while the other three were hung by rigs above the stage . The center unit consisted of three screens that faced outward ; two others were hung right and left to the center unit , both were double faced toward the center of the venue at a 45 \u00b0 angle , while the backside faced the upper-seat audience . The structure of the video panels was designed by Sims to ensure that all seats within the 270 \u00b0 angle at each venue received an equal view of the video screens . Video content and lighting were designed by Se\u00e1n Burke ; the latter was provided by Production Resource Group ( PRG ) . The tour used seven individual rigs for performers and props to become airborne . For dancers to be flown to the center of each upstage , a wench , which dropped 18 inches off the face of the panel , was placed in the rig . Cyrus ' flying required two wenches , one for a vertical lift and one for a horizontal move that coursed the audience and back to the stage . Four elevators , or trap doors , were located throughout the stage , some of which had the option of a 4 \u00d7 4 or an 8 \u00d7 8 foot opening . All of the fly rigs and elevators were built and operated by Show Group Production Services ( SGPS ) / Showrig . The challenge that presented the most difficulty for SGPS was time constraint , as there were only three weeks of rehearsal . Brian White , co-owner of SGPS , explained , There wasn \u2019 t a lot of time , but the good news was that it was at the [ L.A. ] Forum , which gave us a lot of height to fly things around , and there was also a lot of room to lay stuff out on the floor . The other good thing was that our offices are only 10 minutes away . So if I had to send a welder down there to make some changes I could do it pretty fast . The biggest thing we had going for us was a great crew . We had some really good people out there . \" [ ... ] I \u2019 d say that about 90 percent of what we built on Miley Cyrus fit the first time in rehearsal . The only reason we had to retro fit anything was because of last minute design changes that came about once everything was up and they could see it all . Special effects and pyrotechnics were provided by Pyritz Pyrotechnics Group . Terry Ritz , founder of the organization , and his partner Steve Aleff had created various ideas based on the tour soundtrack that was provided to them by the Wonder World Tour 's personnel . They met with the tour 's choreographer , band manager , and lighting designer , asking them to bring their \" hopes , wishes , and dreams . \" Out of these meetings , the show was completed and a lighting crew , who monitored the stage with a four-camera monitor system when cues were executed , was selected . The pyrotechnics for the show were described as more elegant and subtle , being composed of pink flames with accentuation of silver and white glitter . Because of the extensive automation executed throughout the concert , two personnel were in charge of running it . Neville Emerton ran the automation from under the stage , and Sean Conner ran all of the flying moves from a position at the front of each venue . Meanwhile , assistant stage manager Seth Posner called cues for each concert . \" Normally , in a rock show you don \u2019 t need someone calling the show . In this one we had to take a more theatrical approach with someone calling cues every step of the way because there was so much going on at once between props and automation \" , explained production manager Omar Abderrahman . One of the props that required much attention on the part of Posner was a car made to resemble a tractor , designed and built by effects designer and stage manager Scott \" Stryker \" Christensen . Because it came along late in the design process , the main elevator was not built to handle the weight of the car , though it was eventually reinforced to support the weight and movement of the car . The car was also modified ; it was made electric , instead of using a combustion engine , for fire-safety and changed to turn around by adjusting its turning radius to automate steering with all four wheels . In order to translate the concert tour overseas to the United Kingdom , the Wonder World Tour paired with Sound Moves , a company that was already providing minor support for the North American leg of the tour . = = Concert synopsis = = The main show commenced with Cyrus emerging from the bottom of the stage inside a large , crystal-like glacier . She wore a black leather hot pantsuit , a tank top , and a white fur vest with a silver sequined hood as she escaped the cocoon to perform the concert 's opening number , \" Breakout \" . Numerous backup dancers accompanied her and , towards the conclusion , she performed atop movable scaffolding . After removing the fur vest , Cyrus performed \" Start All Over \" atop the scaffolding and continued the remainder of the first segment of the show with \" 7 Things \" and \" Kicking and Screaming \" . Cyrus then executed the show 's second segment with a performance of \" Bottom of the Ocean \" , which featured an aquatic theme for the stage and Cyrus donning a silver , flowing evening gown that bared a bejeweled bodysuit underneath . The performance ended with Cyrus diving into the stage , succeeded by a simulation of her underwater on the video screens . Cyrus returned to the stage for the show 's third segment atop a tractor-resembling car to perform \" Fly on the Wall \" . During the performance , Cyrus wore an extravagant white dress with a feathered skirt . Backup dancers were flown up into contact with panels in order to resemble a fly on a window ; meanwhile , Cyrus was flown across the arena . Once back in the stage , Cyrus and backup dancers performed a brief dance interlude of Michael Jackson 's \" Thriller \" ( 1984 ) . Replacing the feathered bottom with a tutu , Cyrus performed the Hannah Montana-credited song \" Let 's Get Crazy \" and \" Hoedown Throwdown \" . The latter was followed by a video in which will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas spoke about Cyrus , as she left the stage . When the video was completed , the dancers performed a remix of the Black Eyed Peas ' \" Boom Boom Pow \" ( 2009 ) . The show 's fourth segment opened with \" These Four Walls \" , in which Cyrus wore a black high-low dress . The song was performed in B-stage with various acoustic musicians . The show proceeded with \" When I Look at You \" , a performance that featured the trailer for Cyrus ' film The Last Song ( 2010 ) and her performing with a grand piano . It concluded with \" Obsessed \" , which the singer performed atop a simple suspension bridge . She re-entered the stage , clothed by a black tee , red cheetah-patterned hot pants , and black boots , to perform the second Hannah Montana-credited song \" Spotlight \" and , later , \" G.N.O. ( Girl 's Night Out ) \" , replacing the prior hot pants with black ones and adding a denim vest . She followed with a cover of Arrows ' \" I Love Rock ' n ' Roll \" , where Cyrus mounted a red Harley-Davidson Dyna Fat Bob FXDF 2010 that was suspended above the stage and traveled in a semi-oval path across the venue . Performances of \" Party in the U.S.A. \" , which made use of a luggage cart , and \" Hovering \" , which featured Cyrus ' older brother Trace Cyrus , rounded off the segment . The sixth segment of the show featured Cyrus performing \" Simple Song \" , in which she dressed in a long , white shirt and a black tuxedo , in order to simulate a music conductor . Midway through the performance , Cyrus stepped onto an elevator that rose eight feet from the stage . She exited the stage and returned for the final section . During the encore , Cyrus dressed in a white tank top and shorts , boots , and a metallic vest to perform \" See You Again \" , later removing the vest to conclude the concert with \" The Climb \" . Immediately after finishing , she exited through a passageway in the stage as fireworks were fired above . = = Critical reception = = Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times , in reference to Hannah Montana , commented , \" Once again , make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing . \" Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma , commenting that she portrayed superstar authority , but failed because she was unable or unwilling to \" give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means . For all its eye-popping detail , the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don 't already know about her . \" Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated , \" Cyrus ' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today . She 's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch , but her show 's choreography barely provides a moment for her to catch her breath , and she 's still able to deliver . \" Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert , praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults . He continued , \" Good as the best songs are , though , they take a backseat to the staging [ ... ] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change . It 's a tacky moment and doesn 't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight . \" Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said , \" Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience . \" Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus ' charisma , drive , spunk , and a merely-limited vocal range . Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show , stating that it was \" a pure visual spectacle \" , but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus ' personality . Jim Harrington of The Oakland Tribune described the show as a human embodiment of Britney Spears ' \" I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman \" ( 2002 ) . He presumed that the tour was a conscious transition for fans who did not want Cyrus to separate herself from the Hannah Montana franchise . Kirsty Cameron of The Daily Telegraph wrote , \" Despite her relatively young age , Cyrus showed her unfailing capability as performer . With the help of her back-up dancers , Cyrus provided her audience with choreographed set pieces and a different spectacle for each song . \" James Reed of The Boston Globe noted that the Wonder World Tour presented Cyrus as both a \" PG-rated tween pop star and an edgy rocker eager \" . He stated that although she played both roles well , it was apparent that she was more at ease with the latter . Reed also felt the concert did little to display Cyrus ' personality and ability to engage with the audience . \" We know she 's got impressive vocal chops , but now we need to feel what she 's trying to put across in her songs , something beyond the standard ' You guys are awesome ! ' banter . \" Scott Iwasaki of Deseret News reviewed a concert in which Cyrus was ill . He mentioned that because of her illness , her voice went flat . Iwasaki also expressed his viewpoint that \" if there [ were ] any worries that Miley Cyrus would become another Britney Spears train wreck , those worries were quelled during Tuesday night 's show . She kept the show family-friendly and , although obviously sick , looked like she had a good time . \" Marlin Levison of The Star Tribune believed the concert lacked much profundity until the last performance . = = Commercial performance = = The Wonder World Tour was commercially successful and represented stability in the touring industry , despite the financial recession . In North America , the tour sold out twenty-nine out of forty-five concert dates and grossed over US $ 45.2 million . The tour was able to remain as one of the hottest tours in the United States during its expansion . The Wonder World Tour 's entire , ten-date European leg sold out in only ten minutes . In order to meet demand , an eleventh date was added and scheduled for December 29 , 2009 . In December 2009 , the tour ranked atop Billboard 's Hot Tours , based on the tour 's European performances . For the month , box office grossed US $ 21.9 million for eleven shows in four markets . The five concerts held at The O2 Arena in London produced ticket sales that topped $ 11 million ( \u00a3 6.8 million ) . On December 19 , 2009 , with an audience of 16,196 , Cyrus broke the record for the largest attendance at The O2 Arena ; a record that surpassed the previously tied records by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles ' I Am ... Tour ( 2009 \u2013 10 ) , Bon Jovi 's Lost Highway Tour ( 2007 \u2013 08 ) , and Coldplay 's Viva la Vida Tour ( 2008 \u2013 10 ) . In total , the tour grossed over $ 67.1 million , $ 15 million which were earned by Cyrus . = = Bus accident = = On November 20 , 2009 , in its attempt to arrive at the destination of Greensboro , North Carolina , one of the buses for the Wonder World Tour overturned on a Virginian highway . The accident occurred around 8 : 15 A.M. in Dinwiddie County , about 40 miles south of Richmond , Virginia . The bus ran off the left side of Interstate 85 , struck an embankment , rolled onto its right side . An eye witness of the accident explained that the bus appeared to have drifted off the road for a fairly long stretch before tipping over . The bus had nine passengers aboard , including members of the lighting crew , though Cyrus was not on board during the incident . Most of the passengers on the bus suffered only minor injuries and escaped the crashed bus through the broken front windshield . One person , Assistant Stage Manager Martin Zilio , required medical attention and was hospitalized overnight . Zilio recovered from his injuries and was later able to return to work on the tour . One person , bus driver Bill \" Uncle Bill \" Douglas , a 53-year-old of Austin , Texas , died at the scene of the accident . In response to the accident , the Cyrus family released a statement via Cyrus ' official website ; it stated , \" We are deeply saddened by the loss of Bill ' Uncle Bill ' Douglas . Members of our tour are like members of our family . Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family in the midst of this tragedy . He will truly be missed . \" Omar Abderrahman , the tour 's production manager , said , \" That was real tough . It 's always a tragedy to lose anyone . Uncle Bill was a great driver and a good friend . He \u2019 d done a lot of tours with me , and we \u2019 re all going to miss him . \" Although the cause for the accident remains undefined , authorities confirmed the roads were wet from overnight rain . However , CBS News reported that speed and weather were not attributed as factors for the accident 's occurrence . Despite the incident , the tour 's following concert on November 22 , 2009 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro , North Carolina proceeded as scheduled . During the concert , Cyrus dedicated the performance of \" The Climb \" to Douglas as overhead screens displayed a video commemorating him . = = Broadcast and recordings = = The concerts held on December 13 , 14 , 19 , 20 , and 29 , 2009 at The O2 Arena in London were filmed . On May 26 , 2010 , it was announced that the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) would broadcast an hour-long television special entitled Miley Cyrus : Live from London on June 18 , 2010 , as part of promotion for Cyrus ' third studio album Can 't Be Tamed ( 2010 ) . The special was executively produced by Leticia \" Tish \" Cyrus , Cyrus ' mother , and Jason Morey , Cyrus ' manager . It was directed by Russell Thomas and produced by Jim Parsons . Miley Cyrus : Live from London was described by Cyrus ' official website with the following statement : \" The program captures how Miley , who has grown up in the public eye , has grown as an artist and reveals her natural progression and sophistication . \" The concert special was watched by over 2.6 million viewers in the United States . Miley Cyrus : Live from London 's airing on ABC was a filtered version of the full-length concert , which became available on the limited , deluxe edition of Can 't Be Tamed , released on June 21 , 2010 . The deluxe edition featured the audio CD , containing the album 's music , and a DVD , which contains nineteen live performances and behind-the-scenes footage with Cyrus . \" We anticipate an overindexing , if you will , of those who buy the CD / DVD over just the music because it 's never been seen before \" , stated Abbey Konowitch , general manager of Hollywood Records .

                    "text": "Ac\u00e9rcate = \" Ac\u00e9rcate \" ( English : \" Come Closer \" ) is a song recorded by Puerto Rican reggaet\u00f3n recording artist Ivy Queen and duo Wisin & Yandel for Queen 's seventh studio album Drama Queen ( 2010 ) . It was composed by Queen and Marcos Masis alongside the duo , while being produced by Luny Tunes and Tainy . Originally entitled \" No Te Equivoques \" , the song was leaked onto the Internet prior to the album 's release , which prompted Ivy Queen and Wisin & Yandel to re-record the song . Wisin & Yandel released a solo version of the song with lead vocals performed by them under the original title . While failing to chart on main Latin songs charts in Billboard magazine , it did manage to debut and peak at number sixteen on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Digital Songs chart , charting simultaneously with the lead single off the album \" La Vida Es As\u00ed \" which obtained the number two position . The song brings together the first studio album released by Ivy Queen in three years and first for Machete Music , after being with Univision Records since 2005 . = = Background = = After the success of her 2007 effort Sentimiento , which was certified Platinum by the United States Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , a substantial live album was distributed by Machete in 2008 . Subsequently , Queen signed a new record deal with the label in April 2010 , as they celebrated their fifth anniversary . The signing , described as a 360 deal , includes profit sharing in tours , sponsorships and merchandising . Ivy Queen was previously signed to a distribution deal with Univision Records , which in turn was acquired by Machete 's parent company Universal Music Latin Entertainment in 2008 . President of Universal Music Latino and Machete , Walter Kolm , commented in a press release that : \" It 's a privilege to have Ivy Queen apart of over artistic roster . Ivy is an extraordinary woman with incomparable talent , and she 's number one in her genre . We 're happy to be able to work with her on her new album as well as future projects \" . \" I 'm very proud to be a part of Machete Music . They are a young , vibrant company that has created a name for itself in Latin music in the United States and the world . They are a strong and important company that has been recognized for nurturing their artists \u2019 creative talents , \" said Ivy Queen , regarding the partnership . Ivy Queen told Efe that the composition process started while she was heartbroken at home . Her emotions then burst out in the recording studio . She added the song is one of 26 songs she wrote during this period . = = Music and lyrics = = The song was composed by Queen , Marcos Masis , Juan Luis Morera Luna and Llandel Veguilla Malav\u00e9 ; the duo known as Wisin & Yandel . Musically , it features minor key tonality and synthesizers . Production was handled by the Dominican-born duo of Luny Tunes and Tainy . Frances Tirado from Primera Hora described the song as being pure reggaeton and as a song that brings out the figure in Ivy Queen . \" Ac\u00e9rcate \" , along with the rest of the album , was recorded at Mas Flow Studios in Carolina , Puerto Rico . A version with lead male vocals by Wisin & Yandel without lead vocals from Ivy Queen remains unreleased , with a running time of two minutes and fifty-three seconds . It too was produced by Luny Tunes and Tainy . \" Ac\u00e9rcate \" was leaked onto the Internet prior to the album 's release ; a first in Queen 's 15-year career . Originally entitled \" No Te Equivoques \" , it was re-recorded in response to the infringement and included on the album retitled \" Ac\u00e9rcate \" .

                    "text": "Glassheart Tour = The Glassheart Tour was the second headlining concert tour by British recording artist Leona Lewis . It was launched in support of her third studio album , Glassheart ( 2012 ) . Announced on 8 October 2012 , with an initial run of sixteen dates in the United Kingdom , the Glassheart Tour was extended to include five dates in Germany and one in Switzerland . English singer-songwriter Ryan Keen served as the support act . It marks the first time that Lewis has performed material in Europe as part of a headline tour ; her previous tour The Labyrinth ( 2010 ) , only visited the UK . Lewis was inspired by American hip hop artist and music producer Kanye West 's style of performance and noted British playwright William Shakespeare as inspiration for the tour . Lewis performed the set list with her band which consisted mostly of a string quartet and acoustic song arrangements . It was the acoustic performances and Lewis ' vocals that garnered the most praise from critics ; however , there was a mixed reaction to some of the arrangements such as the reggae influences on \" Better in Time \" . Critics were also divided over the lack of diversity from previous live performances though Lewis ' stage presence was commended . = = Background and development = = Lewis released her third studio album Glassheart on 12 October 2012 , almost a year after the original release date of November 2011 . The album had been conceptualised in July 2010 , following Lewis ' completion of her first tour , The Labyrinth . The album title Glassheart was inspired from a conversation that Lewis had with Ryan Tedder . During the conversation , Tedder asked Lewis about her past experiences with love and life in general . Lewis ' response led him to the word \" Glassheart . \" During an interview with Clyde 1 radio , Lewis said \" Glassheart represents protecting your heart , yourself and protecting your emotions , its very poignant \" . On 8 October 2012 , a week before the album 's UK release , Lewis announced her supporting tour of the same name . The tour is named after the album , and although Lewis said she is not American hip hop artist and music producer Kanye West 's \" biggest fan \" , she was inspired by his tour performances where he appeared on stage alone and just \" did his thing \" . During an interview with Digital Spy , Lewis told Tom Eames that Glassheart has a running theme about \" star-crossed lovers that can 't be together \" , and so it was likely that this idea would feature on the tour . Lewis also cited William Shakespeare as another source of inspiration . She spent the three days of the final tour rehearsals at The Backstage Centre in Purfleet , Essex ( UK ) . The Glassheart Tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one venues across Germany and the United Kingdom . The tour was expected to begin on 15 April in Berlin . The list had expanded from an initial sixteen to include five dates in Germany . Lewis would then proceed with UK dates beginning in Glasgow , including two dates at London 's Royal Albert Hall before finishing on 18 May in Plymouth . Speaking about the tour , Lewis said \" I can 't wait to get out there and play my new songs . I had such fun on my last tour and I 'm really excited about doing it again next year . \" Barclaycard ran a competition which gave fans the chance to win tickets to 6 May concert at Birmingham 's National Indoor Arena . = = Critics ' reviews = = In a review for the Express & Star , Elizabeth Joyce said although Lewis was not like her contemporaries : \" meat dress-wearing \" Lady Gaga or the Russell Brand-marrying Katy Perry , \" no one can reach those soft lows or soaring highs quite like her \" . Joyce praised the concert for showing the best of Lewis ' vocal abilities . Focussing predominately on songs from Spirit ( 2007 ) and Glassheart ( 2012 ) , the concert was largely acoustic music with a band and string quartet . In particular Joyce praised Lewis ' performances of \" First Time Ever I Saw Your Face \" and \" Bleeding Love \" which earned her standing ovations , in addition to the \" note perfect \" rendition of \" Run \" . Katherine Hollisey-McLean for the Worthing Herald largely agreed , commenting that if anyone expected Lewis to be \" belting out song after song \" they were right . Hollisey-McLean praised the decisions to switch the song arrangements , for example adding reggae beats to \" Better in Time \" and performing the acoustic version of \" Trouble \" . She ended by saying that Lewis ' vocals were \" flawless \" and that her stage presence and confidence had vastly improved over the last seven years . The Guardian 's Malcolm Jack was less impressed ; he stated that when Lewis tried to diversify the show by dancing or switching the arrangements , she risked becoming the British diva that pop music forgot . Jack said that during a \" sassy dance routine \" for \" Forgive Me \" Lewis came off as a \" budget Beyonc\u00e9 \" , whilst on the \" cringey windin ' and grindin ' reggae take on ' Better in Time ' song \" she comes across like a \" reasonably priced Rihanna \" . Jack concluded by saying the show was in need of a shot of \" adrenaline \" . In writing for the Nottingham Post , Paul Hindle agreed , saying that when the tempo increased and choreography was introduced \" Lewis looked endearingly uncomfortable \" ; however , Hindle was positive about Lewis ' vocals , calling her vocal performance \" virtuoso \" . He concluded that Lewis ' \" spellbinding rendition \" of \" Run \" was a highlight of the concert , and that fans should not have left disappointed . = = Set list = = The following set list is representative of the show in Berlin on 15 April 2013 . It may not represent the setlist from all of the shows . \" Come Alive \" \" Fireflies \" \" A Moment Like This \" ( Acoustic version ) \" Collide \" \" Forgive Me \" \" Better in Time \" ( contains elements of \" Man Down \" , a song originally performed by Rihanna ) \" Happy \" \" Sugar \" \" I to You \" \" Broken \" \" Trouble \" ( Acoustic version ) \" Locked Out of Heaven \" ( A cover originally performed by Bruno Mars ) \" Footprints in the Sand \" \" The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face \" \" Bleeding Love \" \" Glassheart \" \" Run \" Notes Lewis performed a cover of the Rihanna song \" Diamonds \" in Scarborough on 12 July 2013 . = = Shows = =",

                    "text": "Who Can See It = \" Who Can See It \" is a song by English musician George Harrison , released on his 1973 album Living in the Material World . The lyrics reflect Harrison 's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles ' legacy , three years after the group 's break-up , and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band 's unprecedented popularity . Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish , following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass and his 1971 \u2013 72 Bangladesh aid project . The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between Living in the Material World and John Lennon 's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release , Plastic Ono Band . A dramatic ballad in the Roy Orbison vein , the composition features unusual changes in time signature and a melody that incorporates musical tension . Harrison self-produced the recording , which includes heavy orchestration and a choir , both arranged by John Barham . Several commentators consider Harrison 's vocal performance on \" Who Can See It \" to be among the finest of his career , while his production style has been likened to that of Beatles producer George Martin . The other musicians on the track are Nicky Hopkins , Klaus Voormann , Jim Keltner and Gary Wright . Among reviews of the song , \" Who Can See It \" has been described variously as an \" aching , yearning masterpiece \" , a \" song which goes on far too long to make its simple point \" , and an \" unequivocal statement \" on Harrison 's identity . In line with his self-image as a musician , regardless of his past as a Beatle , Harrison included \" Who Can See It \" in the setlist for his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar , the first tour there by a former Beatle since the band 's break-up . = = Background and inspiration = = As with the majority of the songs on his Living in the Material World album , George Harrison wrote \" Who Can See It \" over 1971 \u2013 72 . In his autobiography , I , Me , Mine , he makes light of the emotion behind the song , describing it as simply \" a true story meaning ' Give us a break , squire ' \" . Simon Leng , Harrison 's musical biographer , recognises the song as a statement of considerable personal anguish , however . He writes of Harrison having been \" deeply traumatized \" by the effects of the Beatles ' unprecedented popularity , and equally disoriented by his success as a solo artist following their break-up in April 1970 . According to Leng , Harrison was in the same state of internal conflict over 1972 \u2013 73 as John Lennon had been when writing the song \" Help ! \" in 1965 , during his self-styled \" fat Elvis period \" . Music critic Stephen Holden highlighted a similar comparison between the two ex-Beatles in July 1973 , when he deemed Living in the Material World to be \" as personal and confessional \" as Lennon 's primal therapy-inspired Plastic Ono Band album ( 1970 ) . During the Beatles ' career , Harrison had been the first to tire of Beatlemania and the group 's celebrity status , and he had written songs rejecting what Leng terms the \" artifice \" surrounding the band . Lennon himself described the Beatles ' predicament as \" four individuals who eventually recovered their individualities after being submerged in a myth \" . In addition , for Harrison , while he began to match Lennon and Paul McCartney as a songwriter towards the end of the group 's career , his relatively junior position in the Beatles was a source of frustration to him , which , according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore , left \" deep and lasting wounds \" . Aside from being released from the psychological pressure of being a Beatle in 1970 , Harrison was the one who potentially benefited the most from the group 's break-up . His 1970 triple album , All Things Must Pass , was a major commercial and critical success , eclipsing releases by both Lennon and McCartney . According to author Ian Inglis , Harrison became \" popular music 's first statesman \" as a result of both All Things Must Pass and his 1971 \u2013 72 Bangladesh aid project . The last of these established humanitarianism as a new direction for rock music , in addition to focusing on Harrison the level of attention previously afforded the Beatles . While Leng describes \" Who Can See It \" as a \" plea for understanding from a private man living his life in public \" , Inglis writes that , after the \" euphoria \" of his recent achievements as a solo artist , Harrison was forced to confront \" some of the more unpleasant realities of his everyday life \" . = = Composition = = \" Who Can See It \" is in the musical key of E. The melody incorporates various augmented and diminished chords , which Harrison describes in I , Me , Mine as \" all kinds of suspended chords \" , since he played them in an open tuning on the guitar . The song starts with a solitary guitar figure and then builds in intensity through the verse and into the chorus , as musical tension matches the emotion of the lyrics . Leng views \" Who Can See It \" as a \" new type of ballad \" from Harrison , one that combines a \" dramatic edge \" with rhythmic sophistication . The time signature shifts throughout the composition , from 4 / 4 to 6 / 4 and 5 / 8 , with brief portions in 5 / 4 and 3 / 4 . In Leng 's description , the melody features \" sweepingly large chromatic intervals \" , beginning with the verse 's third line \u2013 a four-semitone swoop that recalls the ascending melismas commonly used in Indian music . Harrison later remarked , with reference to the boldness of the tune : \" [ ' Who Can See It ' ] reminds me of Roy Orbison for some reason . He could do this good . \" Among the material Harrison wrote or finished for Living in the Material World , several songs reflect on his years with the Beatles , and in the case of \" Who Can See It \" , with bitterness . In the opening verse , he states : I 've been held up I 've been run down I can see quite clearly now through those past years When I played towing the line . Inglis views these lines as a reference to Harrison 's working-class upbringing as well as his years as a member of the Beatles . In the chorus that follows , Harrison contends that , having personally lived through these experiences , his sole wish is that his feelings \" Should not be denied me now \" , and he concludes : \" I can see my life belongs to me / My love belongs to who can see it . \" Inglis offers a simple pr\u00e9cis of this statement : \" he has paid his dues . Now he is his own man ... \" In the song 's second verse , Harrison sings of having \" lived in fear \" and witnessed the hatred created by \" this sad world \" . While later discussing his aversion to performing live after 1966 , Harrison presented a similar imagery , citing the Beatles ' concerns regarding the threat of assassination . He also referred to the band 's fame as \" very one-sided \" , since the Beatles \" gave their nervous systems \" while receiving the adulation of their fans . Leng finds the words to verse two typical of Harrison 's tendency towards \" internalization of world events \" in some of his songs from this period , whereby \" hate , conflict and strife \" are projected onto the \" wider world \" in the likes of \" Who Can See It \" and \" The Light That Has Lighted the World \" . Theologian Dale Allison views the mention of \" this sad world \" as a further reference to the essentially \" tragic \" nature of human existence , after \" All Things Must Pass \" and in anticipation of later Harrison songs such as \" Stuck Inside a Cloud \" , in that \" notwithstanding all the success and adulation \" , ultimately , \" we are all alone \" . Allison writes of the message behind \" Who Can See It \" : \" Here he declares his freedom from his Beatle past , his freedom to be himself . \" = = Recording = = Harrison had intended to co-produce his long-awaited follow-up to All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector , a mainstay of his career since 1970 . Spector 's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone \u2013 an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable , in light of how Spector 's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as \" Who Can See It \" and \" The Day the World Gets ' Round \" . Another regular Harrison collaborator , John Barham , provided orchestral arrangements as before , and noted an \" austere quality \" in some of the new songs . \" George was under stress during Living in the Material World , \" Barham said later . \" I felt that he was going through some kind of a crisis . I think it may have been spiritual , but I cannot be sure . \" Harrison taped the basic track for \" Who Can See It \" between October and December 1972 , either at the Beatles ' Apple Studio in London or at FPSHOT , his home studio in Henley , Oxfordshire . He recorded his vocals during the first two months of the new year , and Barham 's orchestration and choir were added in late February . Harrison 's twin electric-guitar parts recall the sound of the Beatles ' Abbey Road album , through his use of a Leslie rotary effect \u2013 a detail that Leng finds significant , given the song 's subject matter . In another Beatles comparison , music journalists Alan Clayson and John Metzger consider Harrison 's production on Material World to be similar to George Martin 's work with the band . Leng writes of \" Who Can See It \" having been \" conceived with an Orbison vocal \" , and the singing duly reflects Orbison 's more dramatic style . Harrison 's vocal reaches falsetto in places , while , in Clayson 's description , \" swerving from muttered trepidation to strident intensity \" during the course of the song . Aside from Harrison , the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins ( piano ) , Klaus Voormann ( bass ) and Jim Keltner ( drums ) . As can be heard in the outtake of \" Who Can See It \" available unofficially on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg , Gary Wright 's original contribution was a prominent harmonium part , superseded by Barham 's strings and brass on the released version . Leng nevertheless credits Wright with playing organ on the song . = = Release and reception = = Apple Records released Living in the Material World at the end of May 1973 in the United States and a month later in Britain . \" Who Can See It \" appeared as track 4 on side one of the LP format , in between what Leng terms the \" perfect pop confection \" \" Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long \" and another song that referenced Harrison 's Beatle past , \" Living in the Material World \" . Reflecting the album 's lyrical themes , Tom Wilkes 's art design contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world , by featuring Hindu religious images such as a painting of Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna , and a photograph of Harrison and his fellow musicians at a banquet , surrounded by symbols of material wealth and success . The album confirmed Harrison 's status as the most commercially successful ex-Beatle , but it drew criticism from some reviewers for the number of slow songs among its eleven tracks , as well as the perceived preachy tone of Harrison 's lyrics . According to author Michael Frontani , lines such as \" My life belongs to me \" in \" Who Can See It \" \" betrayed sentiments of a man increasingly at odds \u2026 with fans and critics who wanted him to be ' Beatle George , ' or at least to be less fixated on his spirituality \" . In his review for Rolling Stone , Stephen Holden wrote that , amid Material World 's \" miraculous ... radiance \" , the song represented \" passionate testament \" and \" a beautiful ballad whose ascendant long-line melody is the most distinguished of the album \" . In Melody Maker , Michael Watts described Living in the Material World as \" far , far removed from the Beatles \" and \" more interesting \" lyrically than All Things Must Pass . Watts noted the \" large autobiographical insights \" provided in Harrison 's songwriting , of which \" Who Can See It \" showed \" he 's found the way at last \" . Writing of Harrison 's standing on an album he considered \" as personal , in its own way , as anything that Lennon has done \" : Watts said : \" Harrison has always struck me before as simply a writer of very classy pop songs ; now he stands as something more than an entertainer . Now he 's being honest . \" NME critic Bob Woffinden praised the song also , but suggested it was \" ideal material \" for someone with a wider vocal range than Harrison . = = Retrospective reviews = = Some recent reviewers have been less enthusiastic , with PopMatters ' Zeth Lundy opining that , rather than Harrison 's more \" stripped-down \" production aesthetic , \" Who Can See It \" would have benefited from \" the hyper-drama of All Things Must Pass ' resonant abyss \" . Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002 , Greg Kot similarly bemoaned the \" hymn-like calm \" of the performance and its falling short of the \" transcendent heights \" of Harrison 's 1970 triple set . In their Solo Beatles Compendium , Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as a \" song which goes on far too long to make its simple point \" , a situation not helped by a \" histrionic \" vocal from Harrison . Reviewing the 2006 reissue of Living in the Material World for Q magazine , Tom Doyle included it among the album 's best three tracks and wrote : \" the introspective moods of The Light That Has Lighted The World and Who Can See It , with their ornate instrumentation and weepy vocals , are lovely things . \" Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes Material World as \" a treat for the ears \" and , while conceding Harrison 's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney , he writes that Harrison \" worked hard to ensure the choruses of ... ' Who Can See It ' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion \" . In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison 's Apple catalogue , for Classic Rock , Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that \" sparkles with many gems \" ; of these , he adds , \" it 's the more restrained tracks \u2013 Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long , Who Can See It \u2013 that entrance : gorgeous pop songs , all the more forceful for their restraint . \" New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison \" sound [ ing ] battered by recent events and the Beatle legacy \" on \" Who Can See It \" , yet he cites the song as a \" standout \" on an album that \" can be very moving \" . Among Beatles biographers , the Roy Orbison influence in \" Who Can See It \" is frequently noted , as is the fact that Harrison 's lead vocal is one of the best of his career . In addition to admiring the album 's disciplined , George Martin-like production , Alan Clayson has written of the \" hitherto unprecedented audacity \" of the vocals found throughout Material World , adding : \" He may have lacked the Big O 's operatic pitch , but ' Who Can See It ' was among George 's most magnificent performances on record . Veering cleanly into falsetto on other tracks , too , never had his pipes been so adept . \" Elliot Huntley describes \" Who Can See It \" as a \" beautiful ballad \" and an \" aching , yearning masterpiece \" . In his chapter on George Harrison in the book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West , Peter Lavezzoli is another who highlights Harrison 's singing on this \" gorgeous Roy Orbison-esque ballad \" . While praising a vocal that \" positively bursts with passion \" , Leng identifies the song 's \" prevailing emotions \" as \" bitterness and anger \" and notes : \" If any Beatles fan was laboring under the misapprehension that George had enjoyed the [ Beatles ] episode as much as they had , this song tells the exact opposite story . \" Ian Inglis writes that the \" rather ponderous \" arrangement on \" Who Can See It \" limits its \" entertainment \" value but , like \" The Light That Has Lighted the World \" , the song is an \" unequivocal statement of who he is \" . = = Live performance = = In line with his stated refusal to play the role of \" Beatle George \" at the time , \" Who Can See It \" was among the songs rehearsed and played on Harrison 's North American tour with Ravi Shankar in November \u2013 December 1974 . Given the composition 's \" intensity of sentiment \" , Leng views it as a notable inclusion in the concert setlist . Harrison dropped the song in a program reshuffle following the opening show , however , due to his laryngitis-ravaged vocals cords being unable to carry such a demanding tune . The tour was the first North American tour by an ex-Beatle , a fact that encouraged expectations from many critics and concert-goers that were at odds with Harrison 's aim \u2013 which was to present a musically diverse show featuring a minimum of his Beatles-era songs . In an attempt to justify himself , Harrison took to quoting from the chorus of \" Who Can See It \" during interviews , as an example of Gandhi 's advice to \" create and preserve the image of your choice \" . = = Personnel = = George Harrison \u2013 vocals , electric guitars Nicky Hopkins \u2013 piano Gary Wright \u2013 organ Klaus Voormann \u2013 bass Jim Keltner \u2013 drums John Barham \u2013 string and brass arrangements , choral arrangement",

                    "text": "No Stairway = No Stairway is the debut studio album of Glassine , the musical project of Danny Greenwald , first released online and later issued on cassette worldwide by the label Patient Sounds , in April and August of 2015 , respectively . The title is a reference to a line from the 1992 film Wayne 's World . The album garnered significant attention from music journalists for its compositional and production technique . In two Guitar Center stores , Greenwald tapped people playing instruments on his iPhone , and used snippets of these low-quality trackings as loops or synth patches , playing some of them through effects pedals or 4-track machines . The \" dystopian \" environment of Guitar Center shops and his desire to record something without a budget while in New York City is what inspired his idea to use samples of recordings of people playing instruments and build compositions out of them . On Fact 's year-end list of best Bandcamp releases , No Stairway came in at number 19 . = = Background = = Raised in Columbia , Maryland , Greenwald first went to a Guitar Center store at age 14 to buy his first electric guitar . However , he rarely went to the former shop and instead bought equipment from local stores like Atomic Music in Beltsville , Maryland for most of his life . He disliked Guitar Center for its \" dystopian \" and \" unpleasant \" environment , which was one of the major parts of him being influenced to make No Stairway : \" I wanted to take something unattractive and be able to extract beauty from it . I wanted to make that environment float on a cloud . I wanted to inspect little nuances , capture them , and paint with them . \" While living in New York City , there was a point where Greenwald became bankrupt and wanted to create great-sounding tracks with no budget whatsoever without the need of using samples from a digital audio workstation or other computer software . While waiting for a train , he went at a Guitar Center shop near Atlantic Terminal out of boredom . At the store , he heard someone playing a song by Green Day on an electric guitar and noticed the instrument 's poor tone : I remember thinking like , ' what if I could feed that through these weird reverb pedals I have at home ? ' ' Would it sound any different ? ' and it sort of hit me ' why don 't I just record other people playing and then sort of use as my paint ' . = = Production and composition = = Greenwald first tried to take control of the sounds from the expensive synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them , but was unimpressed with the results . On a later visit to the shop , he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album ; he taped a guy who \" was just going for it on a drum kit \" , lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used . The singer described how he felt while editing the sample : \" I started to hear some kind of solace in a place that is sonically hellish . \u201d Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn , and then at a shop in Baltimore . Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song , Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later . Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home . Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder , others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches . These recordings were put together , EQ 'd , mixed and mastered in Pro Tools . Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together , as he tried to \" connect things that were seemingly un-connectable . \" The end result was an album that featured ambient , dub , new-age , experimental and post-vaporwave styles . = = Release and reception = = No Stairway was first self-released on Bandcamp and Glassine 's official SoundCloud page on April 17 , 2015.n the same year , on August 6 , record label Patient Sounds distributed the album on cassette . The title of the album is a reference to the line \" No stairway , denied \" from the 1992 comedy film Wayne 's World . Live at Guitar Center , an album by Brookyln musician Noah Wall that also used Guitar Center recordings , was released slightly before the Glassine album on April 6 . When Greenwald and Patient Sounds accidentally found out about Wall 's record , he almost didn 't want to release No Stairway , feeling \" gutted \" someone had already made an album with an identical concept to his project . However , when the label made Wall aware of Greenwald 's release , he was very excited about the album and his support got Greenwald motivated again to distribute his record . Greenwald has not sent No Stairway to the company despite suggestion to do so from his relatives . A Tiny Mix Tapes journalist praised the album 's style as \" some post-vaporwave produced faux melodic ambiance that \u2019 s all at once subconscious music and next-level field recording . And the esoterica and nostalgic level of listening here is completely outta-whack when paired with the idea that NONE of these samples are realmed in the same genre or created ( potentially ) by the same person . \" Critic Jesse Locke featured it on his column for Aux \" No Rest for the Obsessed \" , suggesting that listeners will wanted repeated hearings of Greenwald 's album unlike Live at Guitar Center . Jayson Greene , scoring No Stairway a 7.2 out of ten in his review for Pitchfork , called the album along with Wall 's record \" slight redemptive \" reminders of Guitar Center 's commercial success during the 1990s pre-Internet period , which contrast with a current time where the chain of retailers may shut down quickly due to extreme financial decrease . He called Greenwald 's editing of such low-quality sound recordings as \" impressive and even a little bewildering , but the knowledge proves unnecessary . \" In May 2015 , Fact magazine honored the record as one of their favorite Bandcamp releases for the month of April , and on their year-end list of \" 20 best Bandcamp releases \" , it was ranked number 19 . In The Fader 's \" Top 2 Reasons Guitar Center Still Shreds \" , No Stairway was number two and Live at Guitar Center topped the list . = = Track listing = = Length addapted from the following source :",

It was written by Martin , Salaam Remi , Elijah King , Afo Verde , Roxana Amed and produced by Remi . The song was chosen in a musical contest organized by FIFA and Sony Music which King won , and it was subsequently arranged for Martin to record the track . It was digitally released as the second single from the compilation album on April 22 , 2014 . \" Vida \" is a Latin pop song that features guitar , ukulele , percussion , horn and \" exotic sounds with a Caribbean feel \" . The song received generally positive reviews from music critics who praised the liveliness of the track and noted the consistency with other songs performed by Martin . It peaked at number five on the US Hot Latin Songs and became Martin 's 23rd top-ten single on the chart . An accompanying music video , directed by K\u00e1tia Lund and L\u00edvia Gama of Bossa Nova Films , was shot in Rio de Janeiro .

The organizers received over 1600 compositions from musicians and fans originating from 29 countries . In February 2014 it was announced that Elijah King and his track \" Vida \" had won the contest ; it was chosen by Martin , a judging panel , and by public vote . The song was co-written by Ricky Martin , King and Salaam Remi with additional writing from Afo Verde and Roxana Amed for the Spanish and Portuguese version of the song . It was produced by Remi under his production name Salaamremi.com. Subsequently , the song was set to be recorded by Martin himself and included on the One Love , One Rhythm \u2013 The 2014 FIFA World Cup Official Album ( 2014 ) .

The Afrojack remix of the song was launched on July 1 . = = Controversy = = On April 25 , 2014 it was announced that Hundred Proof Club , Think Famous Productions , Akela Family and JDK Entertainment were suing Sony Music and King for fraud in the Sony and FIFA 's SuperSong competition . The lawsuit claimed that the competition was rigged and that King , who co-wrote \" Vida \" was always going to win , cheating the other entrants out of their chance of winning the competition . Although the contest was open to applicants worldwide , King had a contractual agreement and Sony apparently asked King to enter the song \" Vida \" : Sony allegedly pressured the plaintiffs to release King from his contract so that he would be eligible to win , in return for compensation . The lawsuit alleges that Sony induced King \u2019 s release from his publishing contract and refused to pay compensation . The attorney Alicia Roman told The Huffington Post , \" [ We \u2019 re looking to ] annul the release due to the fraud they committed . When it \u2019 s annulled , all of the rights to Elijah \u2019 s songs are returned to my client , particularly the song ' Vida ' that Ricky Martin sang . \" Martin has not made any comment on the lawsuit . Additionally , Luis Adrian Cortes Ramos , a finalist from the first season of Idol Puerto Rico filled a $ 10 million lawsuit towards Martin . He sued the singer for releasing \" Vida \" despite claims that he submitted his version of the track as part of SuperSong contest , a version that was never recognized . Ramos ' lawyer released a statement saying \" Ramos was surprised , disillusioned and suffered mental anguish because the song was almost identical to the one he composed . Until that moment , Martin was an idol for Ramos . \" However , Martin 's representative never commented on the lawsuit . = = Composition = = \" Vida \" is a Latin pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-five seconds . It features guitar , ukulele , percussion , guitar and \" exotic sounds , with a Caribbean feel \" . Carolina Moreno of The Huffington Post described the song as upbeat and energetic . Lyrically , the single is about the ability of the football tournament to bring people from different parts of the world together to celebrate and enjoy ' the good life ' . = = Reception = = = = = Critical = = = Melissa Redman of Renowned for Sound gave the song three and half stars out of five and wrote that \" the track is everything you would expect from Ricky Martin and a single for a global sports event . \" She also stated that although the song is not \" groundbreaking \" it is \" a lively and exuberant track that people are bound to bop away to \" . Redman concluded that it is better than Pitbull 's \" We Are One ( Ole Ola ) \" , which serves as the official song of the tournament . Mike Wass of website Idolator wrote , \" there 's something to be said for consistency and Ricky sure knows how to knock out a summery smash with generic Spanglish lyrics that probably sound pretty inspiring after a couple of Coronas . \" \" Vida \" received nomination for a Start-Party song at the 2014 Premios Tu Mundo held on August 21 , 2014 . = = = Commercial = = = Following Martin 's performance of the song at the 2014 Latin Billboard Music Awards \" Vida \" entered at number four on the US Latin Digital Songs chart after selling 6000 copies in its first week .

It was more successful on the US Latin Pop Songs chart where it peaked at number four . \" Vida \" debuted at number 20 on the Spanish Singles Chart . In its fourth week the single reached its peak of number five . Additionally , it peaked at number 12 in the Dominican Republic and number 16 in Mexico , a pop charts part of Monitor Latino . It was less successful in Australia and South Korea where it peaked at number 75 and 146 respectively . = = Music video = = The music video for \" Vida \" was filmed in Rio de Janeiro and was directed by K\u00e1tia Lund and L\u00edvia Gama of Bossa Nova Films . According to Lund , \" The lyrics and the emotion that are reflected in the video for \" Vida \" inspire a celebration of life , in a way that is pure and simple : the sun , coming together and the energy . \" She said that the visual is about life in which differences are celebrated and appreciated easily and with happiness and claimed that was the reason Martin \" just wanted it to be natural \" and to differ from what he had done before with choreography , big sets and directed scenes . Martin also commented the shooting process , \" It 's an incredible feeling to have had the opportunity to participate in a global initiative like SuperSong . I 'm very excited to finally be able to sing ' Vida ' and share this special song with the world . \" On April 21 , Martin released a teaser from the video on his official social networks , while the full video premiered on his Vevo channel on YouTube the next day . It features the singer relaxing in shorts and a tank-top while he sings on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro . The video also contains around 100 extras including kids , samba dancers , models and others intended to represent the diversity of the Brazilian nation . Wass of Idolator praised the video , writing that Martin \" looks great \" in it and mentioned the Brazilian scenery was \" pretty awesome \" . = = Live performances = = Martin performed \" Vida \" for first time at the 2014 Chinese Music Awards on April 23 , 2014 where he also sang his 2013 single \" Come with Me \" .

                    "text": "Acid Tongue = Acid Tongue is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Jenny Lewis , released in September 2008 ( see 2008 in music ) through Warner Bros. and Rough Trade Records . Inspired by jam sessions , the album was recorded in January 2008 in Van Nuys , California with the intent of capturing a more live feeling than 2006 's Rabbit Fur Coat . Lewis worked with a number of guest musicians and wrote the album with boyfriend Johnathan Rice . Lewis , Rice , Jason Lader , and Dave Scher produced the album . Acid Tongue features musical styles ranging from indie rock to alternative country and Americana . Acid Tongue was released to generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics , receiving praise for Lewis ' lyrics and vocals . However , some reviewers criticized the numerous collaborations and felt the sound overwhelmed Lewis . The album charted at number twenty-two in the United States and number fifty-five in the United Kingdom . = = Influences and recording = = Lewis first began work on Acid Tongue after writing the title track on her Rabbit Fur Coat tour . She attempted to work out an arrangement for Rilo Kiley 's Under the Blacklight . It didn 't work , so Lewis recorded it for a second solo album . According to the Los Angeles Times , Lewis was inspired by house parties at Jonathan Wilson 's Laurel Canyon home . \" We 'd go to these jams in the canyon . They 're fantastic . Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era , and younger people who are just starting their bands who happen to live in the canyon , and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs . \" Lewis herself has said that it \" rocks a little harder , \" in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coat 's folk rock influences . Lewis also used Rilo Kiley 's Under the Blacklight , which was notably polished compared to the band 's earlier work , \" as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction \" . She explained that every song she writes is \" a response to the thing that I 've written before \" . \" It 's even as simple as , ' OK , I 've written a ballad , now I want to push myself to write something that 's up tempo . ' If I 'm writing about myself , well , that subject can be tiresome , so then I focus on character-driven songs . So I 'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested . \" The album was recorded in just three weeks at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys , California . The album was co-produced by Lewis 's boyfriend Johnathan Rice , former Beachwood Sparks and All Night Radio member Dave Scher , and Under the Blacklight producer Jason Lader . Lewis attempted to record as many of the songs live as possible . \" We did it in the studio for my 32nd birthday , \" according to Lewis , \" and we had a great time , collaborating with a bunch of friends . It was definitely a lot less focused than Rabbit Fur Coat . With that record I had a very specific vision , [ ... ] but with this record it was really more about the vibe , the songs and the collaborations \" . A source quoted by Entertainment Weekly said that the album \" all sounds super natural , nice , and simple . Like it doesn 't belong in any decade . It 's just timeless . \" The album was inspired by a variety of musical styles , including alternative country , Americana , indie rock , and soul . Talking to Nashville Scene , Lewis said that the songs \" weren 't written off-the-cuff , but they were definitely recorded , not carelessly , but with a real effort to capture a live feeling , particularly with the vocals \" . Lewis continued , \" To me , it 's a big step in a different direction ... and to be able to sink into the vocal take while the band was playing was a very liberating experience for me . \" Lewis told The A.V. Club , \" We played them on the road 100 times , so we knew that we could walk into the studio and record them the same way . [ ... ] It wasn 't really a studio record , but more of a live record in some ways . It was about getting the band together and creating an atmosphere that lent itself to good chemistry between the band members and trying to capture as much of the record live as we could . \" As \" a child of digital generation \" , Lewis had generally worked with Pro Tools , but wanted to capture the \" not-perfect sound \" of some of her favorite records . The musicians were split into two separate bands . The Band A setup ( Jason Boesel , Davey Faragher , Johnathan Rice , and Blake Mills ) would generally play the more rock and roll songs , while Band B would play the ballads . = = Composition = = The album 's title track was described by Lewis as her \" thinly veiled way of getting out of writing a strictly ' confessional ' song , \" Lewis told Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune . \" I may be a liar , or I may not be one . \" The song also referenced a childhood experience of Lewis ' , in which she experienced LSD at the age of 14 . \" The Next Messiah \" , a nine-minute \" ode to Barbra Streisand and the devil , \" was \" tracked completely live , with all the transitions , and it 's the most exciting thing I 've ever been involved with in the studio . I wish the rest of the record had been more like that . \" The song is \" actually three different songs that Johnathan Rice and myself wrote together , \" according to Lewis . \" I happen to be a Barbra Streisand fan , and Barbra Streisand fancies a medley , so we discussed stringing the three songs together . \" The album features a duet with Elvis Costello , \" Carpetbaggers \" . The song was written by Lewis ' boyfriend , Johnathan Rice , to be performed on the Rabbit Fur Coat tour , because they were lacking uptempo songs . Lewis wanted to \" make it less country and a little more pop . So I emailed Elvis . He mentioned he had two new songs and would we be open to recording them . \" These songs became part of Costello 's Momofuku . She & Him 's Zooey Deschanel provides backing vocals on a number of songs , while her bandmate M. Ward plays \" a moody guitar part \" on \" Pretty Bird \" . Ward said that Acid Tongue is \" the greatest record Jenny has ever made . \" There are a number of other collaborations on Acid Tongue ; fellow Rilo Kiley member Jason Boesel , Davey Faragher of Costello 's band The Imposters , Benji Hughes , Ana and Paz Lenchantin , Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes , and Jonathan Wilson all make contributions . The album features production credits from Lewis ' boyfriend Johnathan Rice , Farmer Dave Scher , and Rilo Kiley producer Jason Lader . Lewis 's sister Leslie Lewis provides backing vocals on two tracks , while her father Eddie Gordon plays the bass harp and harmonica . \" He was ill last year , so we started speaking to one another , \" Lewis told The Independent . \" There were no hard feelings . He just wasn 't around . Every couple of years I 'd get a postcard from the road \u2013 a picture of him standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab , in Alaska . He was a very mysterious character . But I thought this was the right time to bring him in . \" \" The Next Messiah \" was influenced by her father . \" When someone isn 't around you create what you imagine your father might be \u2013 ' a race-car driver , a four-leaf clover ' , \" Lewis explained . Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration , for both Acid Tongue and previous work , comes from her parents . Lewis also told The Independent , \" I just don 't know them very well . And I 'm still trying to understand what happened [ with the divorce ] and why . It 's this blank slate , I can 't even remember what happened . But for some reason , these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up , that I want to keep writing about them ... and maybe figure out who I am in the process . \" = = Release = = Entertainment Weekly announced that Lewis had been working on the album in February 2008 . Prior to Acid Tongue 's release , Lewis allowed listeners to hear the title track by calling the toll-free telephone number 1-888-717-ACID . The song was later replaced by a recording announcing two \" secret \" performances in September , including a password and website to obtain tickets . Additionally , several videos were put up on Lewis ' official YouTube page . The videos show Lewis ( or band mates ) at home being visited by Ben Gibbard , of Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service , who has arrived with balloons to listen to the new album . Ben is told that the album isn 't out yet , but Lewis agrees to let him hear \" just one song \" . This is followed by a recording of the title track \" Acid Tongue . \" On September 9 , the entire album was made available in streaming format on Lewis ' official MySpace page . Though not technically downloadable , it was quickly accessed through other means and made available through file sharing . The album was released in both CD and LP formats in a number of territories throughout late September . Select independent record stores also gave away a 7 \" single of \" The Next Messiah \" , split between the two sides of the record . Lewis toured in support of the album 's release , including an appearance at the Austin City Limits Festival and opening for Conor Oberst . = = Critical reception = = Acid Tongue has received generally favorable reviews , scoring a 75 % on review aggregator Metacritic . Creative Loafing said that while Rabbit Fur Coat \" glided through an Appalachian dream world \" , Lewis \" stomps her boots while exploring similar terrain \" on Acid Tongue . The review continued that while the album \" includes plenty of quirky meditations on lost love that recall her previous adventures , [ ... ] well-placed jolts give Acid Tongue greater balance , a component that 's lacking on Rabbit Fur Coat . \" According to The Sunday Times , \" the results are magnificent , [ ... ] but occasionally they are a shaky misstep . \" Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis called Acid Tongue \" sensual and entrancing . \" The Daily Trojan labeled the tracks as \" psychedelic , occasionally sexy , but always timeless \" , although noting that the album \" lacks a thematic focus that can be found on every other album Lewis has released \" . Filter referred to the album 's title track as \" simply beautiful , causing goosebumps to the arms of even the toughest man . [ ... ] It 's rather deep , despite its simplicity , a difficult task to say the least . \" It has also been called \" a prime example of Lewis ' simplistic genius . \" The Times said \" the verses in the title track tickle and tease so that you are practically salivating for the chorus . \" It was also noted that Lewis ' \" delicately seductive vocals are more versatile \" , with the Detroit Free Press stating that her voice \" smoothly mixes classic country with pop and indie-rock , Lewis is as adept on the ballads as she is on the rave-ups . \" The Times considered Lewis ' songwriting \" leagues ahead of anything that she has done in the past \" and her vocals sound \" as though she means it \" . DeRogatis pointed out that \" Lewis ' impressive strength as both a singer and a songwriter is that she makes every listener feel as if her music was crafted just for them . \" However , Angela Zimmerman of Crawdaddy ! felt that Lewis often used a \" pervasive soprano that she can 't quite execute \" on tracks like \" Black Sand \" , \" Pretty Bird \" , \" Trying My Best to Love You \" , and \" Jack Killed Mom \" . Pitchfork Media said that while Acid Tongue is \" immediately pleasurable , \" the album 's downfall is that \" Lewis does such a good job of nailing choice sounds and styles from pop 's past that you can 't help getting reeled in right away ; only upon later reflection do you realize that much of her success lies in evoking something else great rather than achieving a greatness more uniquely her own . \" The review continued , \" In these straitjacketed settings , Lewis ' considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren 't given sufficient room to fully emerge . \" Time noted that Acid Tongue \" sprawl with misplaced ambition \" and that only the title track sticks . Another review observed , \" Lewis seems to be [ ... ] on her way to a more definitive musical existence [ ... ] but she doesn \u2019 t quite seem to know yet . \" Acid Tongue was also slated for its \" hip-hop-like roster of unnecessary cameos . Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward of She and Him make sense , but Elvis Costello sounds intrusive during his duet on \" Carpetbaggers , \" while the black Crowes ' Chris Robinson is just superfluous . \" Crawdaddy ! ' s Zimmerman said that while \" these appearances help flavor the record , [ ... ] I miss the Watson Twins . \" The album was made number 14 in Blender 's 33 Best Albums of 2008 list , and number 46 in Q 's 50 Best Albums of the Year 2008 . It was also voted number 18 in Rolling Stone 's Readers ' Top 30 Albums of 2008 list . \" Acid Tongue \" was number 66 on Rolling Stone 's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008 . = = Track listing = = = = Charts and certifications = = Acid Tongue entered the Billboard 200 at number 24 with approximately 21,000 copies sold .

                    "text": "There 's Got to Be a Way = \" There 's Got to Be a Way \" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her self-titled debut studio album ( 1990 ) . Columbia released it as the fifth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom . It was one of four songs Carey wrote with Ric Wake during their first recording session together , but \" There 's Got to Be a Way \" was the only composition to make the final track listing . It is a socio-political conscious R & B-pop song which addresses the existence of poverty , racism and war in the world which gradually becomes more aspirational and positive as it progresses . The track garnered a mixed reception upon the album 's release in 1990 . While Carey 's vocals were praised , it was seen as too political . An accompanying music video highlights social injustices . The song reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart . = = Background and release = = \" There 's Got to Be a Way \" was written by Mariah Carey and Ric Wake for Carey 's self-titled debut studio album ( 1990 ) . It was written during Carey and Wake 's first recording session together . They composed four songs , but only \" There 's Got to Be a Way \" was chosen for the final track listing . Co-produced by Wake and Narada Michael Walden , it appears as the second of ten songs on the track listing . The track was recorded and engineered by Bob Cadway at Cove City Sound Studios and The Power Station , both located in New York City . He was assisted by Dana Jon Chappelle . It was mixed by David Frazer at Tarpan Studios in San Rafael . The keyboards , bass and rhythm engineering was carried out by Louis Biancaniello , while Joe Franco performed the percussion , Vernon \" Ice \" Black played the guitar , and Rich Tancredo also performing on the keyboards . Walter Afanasieff played the synth horns . Carey provided her own background vocals along with Billy T. Scott , Jamiliah Muhammed and The Billy T. Scott Ensemble . The song was released as the fifth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom . It is available to purchase as a CD single while the remixes are available on vinyl . = = Composition = = \" There 's Got to Be a Way \" is an R & B-pop music song with elements of gospel . The theme of social activism can be heard in the lyrics \" There \u2019 s got to be a way / to connect this world today . \" The song begins with Carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world , and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone . Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics \" Couldn 't we accept each other / Can 't we make ourselves aware . \" = = Critical reception = = Music critic Robert Christgau felt that Carey was being too political in her \" brave , young , idealistic attack \" on war and destitution . Ralph Novak , David Hiltbrand and David Grogan of People wrote that it is a \" testimony to her talent that she does so much with so little . \" They continued to write that Carey 's \" tone and clarity \" makes \" There 's Got to Be a Way \" a \" mesmerizing \" track . To mark twenty-five years since the release of Mariah Carey in June 1990 , Billboard writer Trevor Anderson wrote a track-by-track review of the album in June 2015 . He noted that \" There 's Got to Be a Way \" follows the same melodic tone as the album 's opener \" Vision of Love \" but highlighted their stark lyrical differences , as the former is about social activism and the latter is about love . Although he praised Carey 's vocals , writing that she \" deploys \" one of her best whistle notes of her career , he felt that \" the aim for broad appeal comes at the expense of memorable lyrics . \" = = Music video = = The accompanying music video begins with a shot of an empty street , followed by clips of disadvantaged and poorer members of society going about their daily activities . Two men play dominoes on a wooden crate outside a building , a gang make fun of an elderly man hanging newspapers outside his store and an obese woman walks down the street . Clips of Carey leaning against a wall and sitting on some steps looking on at what is happening are shown . As the first chorus begins , everyone starts to dance joyfully in the street and help those in need . A gospel choir comes out of one of the buildings as the street becomes more crowded with people of all ages and backgrounds rejoicing and getting along with each other .

The song was recorded by Brian Garten at Stone Groove Studios in New York , and mixed by Phil Tan for Riotproof Productions , Inc . All instrumentation was performed by Cox , while Carey sung all the lead and background vocals . In an interview with Ed Lover for the radio station Power 105 in New York City , Carey revealed that the song was one of her favorites from the album and that she recorded her vocals within a day . Following the commercial underperformance of the album 's third single , \" I 'll Be Lovin ' U Long Time \" , \" I Stay in Love \" was released as the fourth single from E = MC \u00b2 . In the United States , it was serviced to mainstream , rhythmic and urban radio stations on October 28 , 2008 . A four-track EP consisting of remixes by Jody den Broeder and Ralphi Rosario was released in the United States on December 16 , 2008 . \" I Stay in Love \" is a \" beat-driven \" and \" piano-laced \" ballad , that is influenced by pop and R & B music genres . The song 's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody , and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat . It is composed in the key of D \u266d major , with Carey 's vocals spanning from the low note of D \u266d 3 to the high note of G \u266d 5 . The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time , and it follows a chord progression of D \u266d \u2013 B \u266d m7 \u2013 G \u266d \u2013 A \u266d . The song features a \" double voice \" effect during its final chorus , where Carey 's normal singing tone throughout the rest of the song is combined with her raised pitch . She raises the pitch one octave , and layers it over her normal tone . Lyrically , the song finds Carey getting \" her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track . \" She describes the old time she shared with her lover . She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship , and that she knows that it is definitely over , she still \" stays in love with him \" . On the United States ' Billboard Dance Club Songs chart , \" I Stay in Love \" became Carey 's fourteenth number-one song on February 14 , 2009 . The track peaked at thirty-seven on the Rhythmic chart , number eighty-one on the Hot R & B / Hip-Hop Songs chart , and number ninety-five on the Pop 100 chart . The track reached number ninety-five on the UK Singles Chart . = = Reception = = = = = Critical reception = = = \" I Stay in Love \" garnered generally positive reviews from music critics . Many complimented the song 's piano-driven melody , as well as Carey 's vocals , while some felt it was too similar to her previous single , \" We Belong Together \" ( 2005 ) . In his review of E = MC \u00b2 , Kevin O 'Hare of The Republican wrote that Carey \" shines \" on the song , while Fox News ' Roger Friedman described it as \" a killer ballad . \" People 's Chuck Arnold named it the best ballad on the album , calling it \" pretty \" . The Houston Chronicle 's writer Joey Guerra described the single as a \" gently grooving ballad that Janet Jackson should be recording instead of wasting her time on tired sex clich\u00e9s \" , while commenting , \" It 's doubtful , however , that Jackson could reach the notes Carey effortlessly hits at the end of the song \" . Richard Cromelin from the Los Angeles Times highlighted Carey 's raw form of singing on the track , writing , \" its unadorned , and her voice is almost leathery in the lower notes . It 's not flattering , but it rings true emotionally . \" Nick Levine of Digital Spy called \" I Stay in Love \" a \" fairly modern Mariah track \" and that although he believed it was a \" retread \" of one of Carey 's previous singles \" We Belong Together \" ( 2005 ) , it is not an \" unpleasant retread \" . Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song is \" a slower , less addictive variation \" of \" We Belong Together \" . Newsday critic , Glenn Gamboa , also called it a \" We Belong Together-sh ballad \" . In separate reviews of the song , both David Balls and Nick Levine of Digital Spy also compared the song to Carey 's \" We Belong Together \" ; the former rated \" I Stay in Love \" three out of five stars , and wrote , \" It may not be the most original of songs , but Carey 's emotion-packed vocals make this a pleasant treat after some vacuous recent offerings . \" Freedom De Luc from The Washington Post described the song as an \" emotive ballad \" , while Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Foster 's Daily Democrat noted \" it could have been recorded in her early ' 90s heyday \u2014 except it 's not as saccharine as some of her early work \" . However , Evan Sawdey of PopMatters described it as one of the album 's \" worst songs \" . = = Music video play = = = = = Background = = = Directed by Carey 's husband Nick Cannon , the music video for \" I Stay in Love \" was filmed in Las Vegas , Nevada , using a story line that Cannon and Carey co-wrote .

Also : That Wentworth Miller 2.0 ain \u2019 t hard on the eyes , either ( in reference to the man who played her love interest in \" We Belong Together \" ) . The commercial for Carey 's Luscious Pink fragrance uses part of the \" I Stay in Love \" music video , with a clip of the song used as audio . The short clip shows Carey getting ready for the Vegas show , by applying her make-up and lipstick , and also applying the fragrance on her neck and cleavage . The release published on Carey 's official website described the concept of the commercial as \" a combination of Mariah 's two passions - music and fragrance . \" = = Live performances = = Due to promotion for E = MC \u00b2 and the single , Carey was featured as a guest judge and musical act on the fifth series of the popular British talent competition , The X Factor .

Prior to her arrival , one of the show 's judges Dannii Minogue said \" Could it get any more nerve-wracking for the contestants ? \" , due to the general strenuous nature of Carey 's songs . Before any of the performances by the finalists , Carey performed \" I Stay in Love \" , accompanied by three background vocalists . She received a standing ovation from the audience and judges , and continued backstage for a taped session with the contestants . At the end of the program , she performed her classic \" Hero \" ( 1993 ) , and was eventually joined by the finalists for the finale of the song . \" Hero \" was re-recorded by the 2008 UK X Factor finalists and released as a single , becoming the second best-selling single of 2008 in the United Kingdom .

Beginning in January 2012 , it was Arjona 's first tour since leaving Warner Music to become an independent artist . The tour was announced in December 2011 with dates at American , Argentinian and Chilean venues , and received a positive critical response . The show was designed for a revolving stage , with Arjona performing while the scenery changed with the songs being performed . Four changes of scenery were developed : a two-floor apartment , a bar , a circus and a theatre . The number of songs played at each show varied from 19 to 23 . The tour broke several records . In Buenos Aires it was the best-attended show ever at Velez Stadium , attracting a total audience of more than 160,000 . In Guatemala City , Arjona became the first artist with two consecutive sold-out concerts at the Mateo Flores Stadium . The tour was seen by more than two million people in twenty countries . Most songs performed were from Independiente , and fellow Guatemalan singer \u2013 songwriter Gaby Moreno joined Arjona for \" Fuiste T\u00fa \" . The Metamorfosis World Tour followed Arjona 's Quinto Piso Tour ( one of the most successful tours by a Latin artist , with a total attendance of over one million in 19 countries ) . = = Background = = Weeks before the release of Independiente , Arjona published an open letter concerning his past relationships with recording companies . He revealed the circumstances surrounding his first contract ( \" a producer , friend of mine , told them [ the record label ] that if they did not sign me in , they won 't sign two artists he had [ at that time ] \" ) , explaining that he received the \" minimum royalty percentage \" from his most successful albums . Independiente is Arjona 's first independent release on his own label : Metamorfosis , a company he created to refocus his career . The company is headed by Arjona and several friends ( including photographer \u2013 director Ricardo Calder\u00f3n , Universal Music M\u00e9xico executive Humberto Calderon and BMG 's Miriam Sommerz ) , and is based in Miami and Mexico City . Arjona asserted that his independence represented compromise more than freedom : \" Inside the word ' Independent ' , even when it sounds like extreme freedom , there 's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to administrate , in the best way possible , such independence \" . Billboard noted that while other groups have released independent albums following contracts with major labels , Arjona is the foremost Latin pop artist to do so . Although the album is marketed by the new label , its distribution is handled by Warner Music . = = Concert synopsis = = = = = Scenography = = = The show was designed for a revolving stage divided into four sets , with Arjona performing with seven musicians and a showgirl . Fifty people were needed to set up the 45-ton stage , which was transported on 17 trucks . One hundred fifty lights , ( seventy of which were mobile ) were used during each concert , in addition to ten tons of scenery . Each set related to the songs being performed . The first evoked a two-floor apartment with books , tables and chairs . Here Arjona sang \" Lo Que Est\u00e1 Bien Est\u00e1 Mal \" , \" Animal Nocturno \" , \" Hay Amores \" , \" Desnuda \" and \" El Amor \" ( during the set change ) . The second set represented a bar , where the singer performed \" Historia de Taxi \" and \" Como Duele \" . He then interacted with the audience on \" Ping\u00fcinos en La Cama \" ; during some concerts Arjona sang to a fan 's phone , and invited an older woman onstage to accompany him on \" Se\u00f1ora De Las Cuatro D\u00e9cadas \" . The third set was a circus , usually changing while Arjona performed \" Reconciliaci\u00f3n \" . Other songs performed on this set were \" Tarde ( Sin Da\u00f1os a Terceros ) \" , \" Fuiste T\u00fa \" ( with fellow Guatemalan singer Gaby Moreno ) , \" Te Conozco \" and \" Si El Norte Fuera El Sur \" . The fourth set was a theatre , similar to the first . Here the singer performed \" El Problema \" before leaving the stage , simulating the end of the concert . After a few minutes , Arjona returned to close the show with \" Minutos \" and \" Mujeres \" . A large LCD screen was over the stage . At the beginning of the concert a fictional news program called Metamorfosis showed a series of images from Arjona 's life , ( while \" Vida \" played in the background ) with images of Salvador Allende , Frida Kahlo , Donald Trump , Barack Obama and others during other songs . In Santiago de Chile , the Chilean flag and peace symbols appeared on the screen . In Buenos Aires , the Argentine flag was shown . = = = Music = = = The number of songs played during each concert varied from 19 to 23 ; seven were from Independiente . Gaby Moreno appeared during every concert to perform \" Fuiste T\u00fa \" . The show began with a video presentation , with \" Vida \" from Poquita Ropa as background music . The video consisted of images ( including those of a young Arjona ) , movies and shows . Arjona then arrived to sing \" Lo Que Est\u00e1 Bien Est\u00e1 Mal \" , \" Animal Nocturno \" ( from the album of the same name ) , \" Hay Amores \" and \" Desnuda \" ( from the album Vivo ) . In some cities ( including Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile ) , Arjona performed \" Acomp\u00e1\u00f1ame A Estar Solo \" before \" El Amor \" ; in Monterrey , \" El Amor \" was performed first . At his concert in Mendoza , Arjona observed that \" The day I chose this career was the day I realized that a spoken verse could earn you a slap , but a sung verse could give you sighs . \" He then sang \" Mi Novia Se Me Est\u00e1 Poniendo Vieja \" , a song he wrote for his mother . \" Dime Que No \" and \" Como Duele \" followed ; in Santiago de Chile , \" Dime Que No \" was replaced by \" Historia de Taxi \" . After \" Como Duele \" in some shows , \" Ping\u00fcinos En La Cama \" was performed before \" Se\u00f1ora De Las Cuatro D\u00e9cadas \" . \" Reconciliaci\u00f3n \" was performed next , while the set changed to a circus .

He 's not the same young man who sang in a bar accompanied only with a guitar . Today he 's surrounded by a great production . \" She finally stated that \" essentially he 's the same : the one who sings to love . \" The Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn praised Arjona 's rapport with his largely female audience after his two-year absence from Argentina .

                    "text": "The Beatles in Hamburg = The Beatles members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison , Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best regularly performed at different clubs in Hamburg , Northern Germany , during the period from August 1960 to December 1962 ; a chapter in the group 's history which honed their performance skills , widened their reputation , and led to their first recording , which brought them to the attention of Brian Epstein . The Beatles ' booking agent , Allan Williams , decided to send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed , Derry and the Seniors , proved successful there . Having no permanent drummer at the time , they recruited Best a few days before their departure . After breaking their contract by playing at another club , Harrison was deported for being under-age , and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson ( after McCartney and Best had set fire to a condom in their living quarters ) . The Beatles first met Astrid Kirchherr in Hamburg , who was instrumental in their adoption of the famous Beatle haircut . During their time in Hamburg , Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue his studies . In April 1962 , less than a year after leaving the group , he died of a brain hemorrhage . = = Hamburg in the 1960s = = Hamburg had once been Germany 's main seaport , the fourth largest in the world , but in 1943 virtually the entire city had been reduced to rubble by World War II bombing raids . By 1960 , when they arrived , the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established its reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity . In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool , Hamburg was a wealthy city . = = = Leaving Liverpool = = = Williams , a 29-year-old Liverpool businessman and promoter , had sent his leading group , Derry and the Seniors ( later known as Howie Casey and the Seniors ) to Hamburg , where they were enjoying success , and wanted to send an additional group . He initially tried to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , but Storm and his group were committed to a Butlins holiday camp and turned Williams ' offer down , as did Gerry and the Pacemakers . Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960 , after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool , and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings . He booked them into Bruno Koschmider 's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960 , but said that he was not impressed with them as a musical group , and hoped to find a better act to follow them . As they had no permanent drummer , McCartney looked for someone to fill the Hamburg position , which was difficult , as Lennon later said that drummers were \" few and far between \" , because a set of drums was an expensive item . Harrison had seen Best playing with the Black Jacks in The Casbah Coffee Club ( which was run by his mother , Mona Best ) . He was regarded as a steady drummer , playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar , which pushed the rhythm , and was known in Liverpool at the time as being \" mean , moody , and magnificent \" by female fans , which convinced McCartney he would be good for the group . After the Black Jacks broke up , McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg , telling him they would earn \u00a3 15 per week each . Best had the chance to go to a teacher-training college , as he had passed his school exams \u2014 unlike Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , who had failed most of theirs \u2014 but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move . The St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg , where the Indra club was located , was well known as an area where prostitutes were to be found , and was a dangerous place for anyone that looked different from the usual clientele . McCartney 's father , Jim McCartney , was reluctant to let his teenage son go to Hamburg , but relented after a visit from Williams , who told him that he \" shouldn 't worry \" . Lennon 's aunt , Mimi Smith , was also reluctant to allow Lennon to go to Hamburg , wanting Lennon to continue his studies , but Lennon placated her by exaggerating the amount he would earn . Best had an audition in Williams ' Jacaranda club on 15 August 1960 , and travelled to Hamburg the next day as a member of the group . Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed , as they had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg , but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money . The group were to be paid about \u00a3 100 per week , which was much more than promoters in Liverpool paid . Williams drove the group and their equipment in his Austin J4 minibus which was loaded by crane onto a ferry at Harwich on 16 August 1960 , and landed at the Hook of Holland . All five Beatles , Williams and his wife Beryl , her brother Barry Chang , and \" Lord Woodbine \" were in the minivan , along with Georg Sterner ( Koschmider 's translator and future waiter ) , making a total of ten people , which resulted in a journey that was both uncomfortable and dangerous . As Williams had not obtained work permits for West Germany , they were detained at Harwich for five hours . Williams finally convinced the authorities that they were students on holiday , although work permits were later obtained after their arrival in Hamburg . Note : ' Lord Woodbine ' and Williams ran a Strip Club called New Cabaret Artistes club at 174a Upper Parliament Street , Liverpool . Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Sutcliffe once played backing music for \" Janice the Stripper \" there , in July 1960 . = = Hamburg clubs = = In the early 1960s , the Hamburg scene revolved around the Kaiserkeller , Top Ten , Star-Club , Beer-Shop , Mambo , Holle , Wagabond ( pronounced vagabond in German ) and the Pacific Hotel , as well as the less popular clubs like Grannies , the Ice Cream Shop , Chugs , and Sacha 's . The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights , with posters advertising the performers in the clubs . Each club had a doorman whose job was to entice customers inside , as the drinks were expensive ( for Babycham and watered-down beer ) . Customers who would not , or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out . = = = The Indra and Kaiserkeller = = = The Beatles arrived very early in the morning of 17 August 1960 , but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg , as it was so infamous . Unfortunately the Indra Club ( 64 Grosse Freiheit ) was closed , so a manager from a neighbouring club found someone to open it up , and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves . The group played at the club on the same night , but were told they could sleep in a small cinema 's storeroom , which was cold and in very poor condition , the Bambi Kino ( 33 Paul-Roosen Strasse ) . McCartney later said , \" We lived backstage in the Bambi Kino , next to the toilets , and you could always smell them . The room had been an old storeroom , and there were just concrete walls and nothing else . No heat , no wallpaper , not a lick of paint ; and two sets of bunk beds , with not very much covers \u2014 Union Jack flags \u2014 we were frozen . \" Lennon remembered : \" We were put in this pigsty . We were living in a toilet , like right next to the ladies ' toilet . We 'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [ women ] pissing next door . \" After having been awoken in this fashion , the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving . They were paid \u00a3 2.50 each a day , seven days a week , playing from 8 : 30-9 : 30 , 10 until 11 , 11 : 30-12 : 30 , and finishing the evening playing from one until two o 'clock in the morning . German customers found the group 's name comical , as \" Beatles \" sounded like \" Peedles \" , which meant a small boy 's penis . Harrison remembered the Reeperbahn and Grosse Freiheit as the best thing the group had ever seen , as it had so many neon lights , clubs and restaurants , although also saying , \" The whole area was full of transvestites and prostitutes and gangsters , but I couldn 't say that they were the audience ... Hamburg was really like our apprenticeship , learning how to play in front of people . \" Best remembered the Indra as being a depressing place that was filled with a few tourists , and having heavy , old , red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller , a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit . After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise , the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller , starting on 4 October 1960 . = = = = Performances = = = = Their playing schedule at the Kaiserkeller remained the same as it had been in the Indra . Lennon said : \" We had to play for hours and hours on end . Every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it . That 's what improved the playing . There was nobody to copy from . We played what we liked best and the Germans liked it as long as it was loud . \" The Beatles had been used to simply standing still when they had performed in Liverpool , but Koschmider would come to the front of the stage and loudly shout \u201c Mach schau , mach schau ! \u201d ( \" make [ a ] show \" or , more idiomatically , \" put on a show \" for the customers ) . Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to \u201c dance around like a gorilla , and we \u2019 d all knock our heads together . \u201d As Best had been the only one to take O-Level German at school , he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group , and was invited to sing a speciality number called \" Peppermint Twist \" ( while McCartney played the drums ) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage . Willie Limpinski , Koschmider 's business manager , decided that the club would attract more customers if it presented continuous live music . Williams warned the Beatles about the competition they would face by playing in the same club as the Hurricanes by saying , \" You 'd better pull your socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in , and you know how good they are . They 're going to knock you for six . \" In early October 1960 , Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg , replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller . They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960 , having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles . They played five or six 90-minute sets every day , alternating with the Beatles . They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors ( who were sleeping in one room at the back of the Kaiserkeller ) had to put up with , so they booked into Hamburg 's Seamens ' Mission . = = = = Violence and conflict = = = = The stage of the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood balanced on the top of beer crates , so the two groups made a bet to see to who would be the first to break it . After punishing the stage for days , a slight crack appeared , and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke . Johnny ' Guitar ' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage , it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him . He disappeared into it , and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr 's cymbals slid into the hole . Koschmider was furious , and had to replace the live music with a juke box . Both groups went across the road to Harold 's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit , but were followed by Koschmider 's doormen , armed with coshes , who beat them all as punishment . Horst Fascher ( born 1936 , Hamburg ) was Koschmider 's nightclub bouncer , who had been the 1959 West German featherweight boxing champion , but his career was cut short after he unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight . He later became a friend of the Beatles , and protected them from drunken customers . Lennon occasionally urinated out of his apartment \u2019 s window onto the street below , and often started arguments with the audience , so that eventually one member of the audience would jump on stage to hit him , but it was Fascher \u2019 s job to protect Lennon and the group . In some occasions beer bottles were thrown at them . Fascher remembered Lennon often greeting the audience with a \" Heil Hitler \" , and a Nazi salute : \" He 'd pull out a black comb and pretend it was a moustache ... people laughed . \" Lennon was missing for a performance one evening , and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman . He broke up the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both , and ordered Lennon onto the stage . Lennon was furious , and complained that he could not go on stage dripping wet . Fascher snapped back : \" I don 't give a shit , you 're going onstage and I don 't care if you do it naked . \" A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter . Fascher ran to see what the commotion was , and saw Lennon playing guitar , but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck . ( Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants ) . Fascher 's brother , Fred sang lead vocals with the group on \" Be Bop A Lula \" , while he sang with them on \" Hallelujah I Love Her So \" , and his alliance with the Beatles continued , as he later went to work at the Star-Club . = = = = Performance skills = = = = According to McCartney , Sutcliffe was a \" typical art student \" , with bad skin and pimples , but his reputation grew after he began wearing tight trousers and dark Ray-Ban sunglasses . Sutcliffe 's high spot was singing \" Love Me Tender \" , which drew more applause than when the other Beatles sang , increasing the friction between himself and McCartney . Lennon also started to criticise Sutcliffe ; making jokes about Sutcliffe 's size and playing . While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles ' biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage , and often playing with his back to the audience , Best denies this , recalling Sutcliffe as usually good-natured and \" animated \" before an audience . The Beatles steadily improved during their time in Hamburg , and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time . McCartney recalled , \" We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us . The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would come in from the Top Ten ( the big club where we aspired to go ) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [ Starr ] would hang around to watch us . \u2018 What 'd I Say \u2019 was always the one that really got them . \" The song was often played by the group , once being played for 90 minutes non-stop , with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning . Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying , \" We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams , who is here at the moment , tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us . \" On Saturday 18 October 1960 , Williams arranged a recording session for Lou Walters ( of the Hurricanes ) at the Akustik Studio , a small booth on the fifth floor of 57 Kirchenallee ( The Klockmann-House ) . Williams asked Lennon , McCartney , and Harrison to play and sing harmonies on the recording . Best was in town buying drumsticks , so Starr , the Hurricanes ' drummer , played drums . This was the first time Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Starr recorded together . They recorded three songs : \" Fever \" , \" September Song \" and \" Summertime \" . = = = The Top Ten = = = Formerly the Hippodrome ( Reeperbahn 136 ) , the Top Ten club was opened in 1960 by Peter Eckhorn , and was operated by Iain Hines , who was an organist . In late October 1960 , The Beatles left Koschmider 's club to work at the Top Ten Club , as Eckhorn offered the group more money , a better PA ( with reverb and echo ) and a slightly better place to sleep ( above the club itself ) although by doing so the group broke their contract with Koschmider . Koschmider then reported Harrison for working under the legal age limit ( even though he had been working at Koschmider 's club ) and Harrison was deported on 21 November 1960 . When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness . As a snub to Koschmider , McCartney and Best found a condom in their luggage , attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room , and set fire to it . There was no real damage done , but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson . McCartney : \" One evening we were just walking down the Reeperbahn , when we heard this ' ta-ti-ti-ta ' , and then ' Komm mit mir ! ' ( ' Come with me ! ' ) \" . Best and McCartney spent three hours in the Davidwache Police Station , and were deported on 1 December 1960 . Lennon 's work permit was revoked a few days later and he went home by train , but as Sutcliffe had a cold , he stayed in Hamburg . Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr ( his German girlfriend ) for the airfare back to Liverpool in early January 1961 . Back in Liverpool , no one contacted each other for two weeks , but Best and his mother made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group 's equipment . Back in Liverpool , the group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 , at the Casbah Coffee Club , with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe , playing bass with them for four shows . Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg , and was struck by how powerful Best 's drumming now was , pushing the group to play harder and louder . ( It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style , as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to \" Crank it up \" = play as loud as possible ) . After Harrison turned 18 and the immigration problems had been solved , the Beatles went back to Hamburg for another residency at the Top Ten Club , playing from 27 March to 2 July 1961 . To secure their return , Eckhorn paid DM 158 to the German authorities , which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter . Fellow musician , Tony Sheridan , later remembered the living conditions at the club : \u201c John , George , Paul , Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn . We moved into a dormitory over the club and slept in bunks . It was terrible really , now I look back . We all washed our own shirts and socks so the place smelt like a Chinese laundry . But we had great times and I \u2019 m afraid we used to tease the life out of the old lady who [ took care of ] us . \u201d Sutcliffe decided to leave the Beatles to concentrate on his art studies and to be with Kirchherr , so McCartney ( unwillingly ) took over as bass player for the group . Sutcliffe later enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art under the tutelage of the pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi . Sutcliffe lent McCartney his H\u00f6fner President 500 / 5 model bass guitar but asked McCartney not to change the strings around , so McCartney had to play it with the strings arranged backwards , until he could buy a specially made left-handed H\u00f6fner bass of his own . McCartney bought his first H\u00f6fner Violin bass guitar ( model 500 / 1 ) from the Steinway-Haus Music Store ( Colonnaden 29 ) Lennon bought a Rickenbacker guitar ( 1958 Model 325 ) and Harrison bought a Gibson amplifier . The matching lilac jackets , made by McCartney 's next-door neighbour in Liverpool to be worn as stage clothes , were soon threadbare , as were any other items of clothing , so the group bought cowboy boots , jeans and black leather jackets and trousers , from Paul Hundertmark 's ( Spielbudenplatz 9 ) and a tailor 's shop at Thadenstrasse 6 . Lennon said : \" We had a bit more money the second time so we bought leather pants ... we looked like four Gene Vincents . = = = The Star-Club = = = On 13 April 1962 , the Beatles were booked as the opening act for the launch of a new club . The Star-Club , opened by Manfred Weissleder , had a capacity for two thousand people , as well as cinema-style seating . When the Beatles were booked to play there , Neil Aspinall left his job to become the Beatles ' permanent road manager , as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant , and had his van ferried to Hamburg . The Beatles returned to Hamburg by plane to play from 13 April to 31 May 1962 . Upon their arrival , they were informed of Sutcliffe 's death . By the time of their second Star-Club visit from 1 \u2013 14 November 1962 , Starr had become the group 's drummer . The Beatles stayed at the Hotel Germania ( Detlev-Bremer-Strasse 8 ) , having the luxury of single rooms for the first time , and then stayed at the Hotel Pacific ( Neuer Pferdemarkt 30 ) for another booking from 18 \u2013 31 December 1962 . Harrison said : \" We came back to play the Star-Club , a big place and fantastic because it had a great sound system . This time we had a hotel . I remember it was quite a long walk from the club , at the top of the Reeperbahn going back towards the city . \" Portions of their final performances were taped with a portable recorder by an associate of Ted \" King Size \" Taylor of the Dominoes , another group playing at the club . The tapes were released on West Germany 's Bellaphon label in 1977 as The Beatles : Live ! at the Star-Club in Hamburg , Germany ; 1962 , and subsequently re-released in various formats and titles . The set list at the Star-Club ( with the lead singer in parentheses ) : \" I Saw Her Standing There \" ( McCartney ) \" Roll Over Beethoven \" ( Harrison ) \" Hippy Hippy Shake \" ( McCartney ) \" Sweet Little Sixteen \" ( Lennon ) \" Lend Me Your Comb \" ( Lennon ) \" Your Feet 's Too Big \" ( McCartney ) \" Red Sails in the Sunset \" ( McCartney ) \" Everybody 's Trying to Be My Baby \" ( Harrison ) \" Matchbox \" ( Lennon ) \" Talkin ' ' Bout You \" ( Lennon ) \" Shimmy Shimmy \" ( McCartney ) \" Long Tall Sally \" ( McCartney ) \" I Remember You \" ( McCartney ) \" I 'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry ( Over You ) \" ( Lennon ) \" Where Have You Been All My Life \" ( Lennon ) \" Twist and Shout \" ( Lennon ) \" Mr. Moonlight \" ( Lennon ) \" A Taste of Honey \" ( McCartney ) \" Besame Mucho \" ( McCartney ) \" Reminiscing \" ( Harrison ) \" Kansas City \" ( McCartney ) \" Nothin ' Shakin ' But the Leaves On a Tree \" ( Harrison ) \" To Know Her is to Love Her \" ( Harrison or Lennon ) \" Little Queenie \" ( McCartney ) \" Falling in Love Again \" ( McCartney ) \" Ask Me Why \" ( Lennon ) \" Hallelujah I Love Her So \" ( club manager Horst Fascher ) \" Be-Bop-A-Lula \" ( Fred Fascher , Horst 's brother ) \" Till There Was You \" ( McCartney ) \" Sheila \" ( Harrison ) = = = Sex , drugs and rock and roll = = = McCartney explained that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool , but when they got to Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers , dancers , or prostitutes . Harrison ( who was then only 17 ) called Hamburg , \u201c The naughtiest city in the world \u201d . McCartney said : \u201c By the time you got to Hamburg , a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper , so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist , who obviously knew a thing or two about sex ... it was quite an eye-opener . \u201d Gerry Marsden \u2014 frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers \u2014 remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon : \" We paid our money , went in and sat down . This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives . She looked like a bus with a bra on . We ran out that door so quick we didn 't hear it shut . I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said : ' No , we 'd better not . Might cause trouble . ' \" The Beatles 's introduction to \" Prellies \" ( Preludin ) was in Hamburg . As the group had to play for hours , Sheridan offered them Preludin , saying : \" Here 's something to keep you awake . \" Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin , which when taken with beer , made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until the early hours of the morning . Looking back , Harrison said that the whole group would be \u201c frothing at the mouth , \u201d and would sometimes stay awake for days . Lennon recalled , \u201c The waiters always had these pills [ Preludin ] , so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink , they \u2019 d give you the pill . You could work almost endlessly until the pill wore off , and then you \u2019 d have another . \u201d McCartney said that he would usually take one , but Lennon would often take four or five . Legitimate use of Preludin required a doctor 's prescription note , but Kirchherr 's mother was able to obtain it from a local chemist which supplied the drug without asking questions . Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner , Weissleder , not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin . Starr explained that Dexedrine too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg , as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus , in association with decreased fatigue , and decreased appetite . = = Record release = = The first recording ever released was the single \" My Bonnie \" , which was recorded in Hamburg during the group 's time at the Top Ten club . The recording came about when the Beatles were recruited by singer Sheridan , who also had a residency at the Top Ten club , to act as his backing group on a series of recordings . The recordings were made for the German Polydor Records label , and were produced by the famed bandleader Bert Kaempfert , who had an instrumental hit called \" Wonderland by Night \" ( \" Wunderland bei Nacht \" ) which reached number one in the U.S. in 1961 , the same year he produced \" My Bonnie \" . On 22 June 1961 , Sheridan and the Beatles drove to Hamburg-Harburg ( about 30 minutes from Hamburg ) to record in the Friedrich-Ebert-Halle ( auditorium / hall ) and were paid 330 Deutschmarks ( about $ 75 ) for the recording , although there was a second recording session on 23 June and a third session in May 1962 . Kaempfert signed the group to a one-year Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961 . On 31 October 1961 , Polydor released \" My Bonnie \" ( Mein Herz ist bei dir nur ) which appeared on the West German charts under the name \" Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers \" \u2014 a generic name used for whoever happened to be in Sheridan 's backup group , although McCartney explained : \" They didn 't like our name and said , ' Change to the Beat Brothers , this is more understandable for the German audience . ' We went along with it ... it was a record . \" The song was later released in the UK , on 5 January 1962 . A few copies were also pressed under the American Decca Records label . = = = Brian Epstein = = = \" My Bonnie \" was to bring the Beatles to the attention of a key figure in their subsequent development and commercial success , Brian Epstein . In September 1961 , Harrison had a German copy of the record , which Sutcliffe had sent to him , as he was still in Hamburg . Harrison loaned it to Bob Wooler ( The Cavern Club DJ ) who played it at various venues , when the members of the group lent it to him . On 28 October 1961 , the 27-year-old Epstein , manager of the record department in his father 's NEMS music store in Whitechapel Street , Liverpool , was asked for the record by an 18-year-old boy , Raymond Jones . Epstein could find nothing on his files about the Beatles or the record , but the following day it was requested again by two girls , this time mentioning that the Beatles had been seen playing at the Cavern , a club in nearby Mathew Street . Alistair Taylor ( Epstein 's assistant ) later said that the story had been invented and that he had used the name Jones to order copies of the record himself . Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated the story about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were , as Harry had been talking to Epstein about the band for a long time ( being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat ) and by McCartney saying , \u201c Brian [ Epstein ] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were , they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat . \u201d Regardless , the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor , during lunch hour on 9 November 1961 . He was initially repelled by the dark , damp club , but he congratulated them on their performance . = = Astrid Kirchherr , Voormann , and Vollmer = = Kirchherr , Klaus Voormann , and J\u00fcrgen Vollmer were early fans of the Beatles after they heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller . Kirchherr , Voormann 's girlfriend , was initially horrified at the idea of spending any time in such a sordid district , but Voormann , after watching the Beatles several times without her , eventually persuaded her to come too . After having previously only listened to Trad jazz , the Platters , and Nat King Cole , the Rock n ' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them . The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night , arriving at 9 o 'clock and sitting by the front of the stage . Kirchherr , then 22 years old , later said : \" It was like a merry-go-round in my head , they looked absolutely astonishing ... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes . All I wanted was to be with them and to know them . \" Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr , and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in , every head would immediately turn her way . Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club , and tried to talk to her during the next break , but she had already left . Kirchherr asked the Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session , which impressed them , as other groups only had snapshots that were taken by friends . The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in a fairground park called \" Der Dom \" which was close to the Reeperbahn . Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe , and they were engaged in November 1960 . Kirchherr is credited with inventing the Beatles ' moptop haircut , although she personally disagrees . In 1995 , she told BBC Radio Merseyside : \" All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles ' haircut , and my boyfriend then , Klaus Voormann , had this hairstyle , and Stuart [ Sutcliffe ] liked it very very much . He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him . Pete [ Best ] has really curly hair and it wouldn 't work . \" After suffering blackouts and intense headaches , Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital on 10 April 1962 \u2014 Kirchherr rode with him in the ambulance \u2014 but died before the ambulance reached the hospital . Three days later Kirchherr met the Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them Sutcliffe had died of a brain haemorrhage . In 1966 , Voormann was asked by Lennon to design the sleeve for the Beatles ' album Revolver , and also played bass on solo recordings by Lennon , McCartney , Harrison , and Starr . In 1995 , Voormann designed the artwork for the three-volume CD sets in The Beatles Anthology series . In 1999 , Kirchherr published a book called Hamburg Days ( a two-volume limited edition ) containing a set of photographs by Kirchherr and \" memory drawings \" by Voormann of the Beatles time in Hamburg . = = Later years = = The Beatles returned to Hamburg in June 1966 , staying at the Tremsb\u00fcttel castle ( Schlosstrasse 10 ) , and played two concerts in the Ernst-Merck-Halle on 26 and 27 June . Lennon later said , \" I might have been born in Liverpool - but I grew up in Hamburg \" . Lennon made the door of J\u00e4ger-Passage at Wohlwillstrasse 22 famous when he posed in front of it for a photo which was later used on the covers of the Rock ' n ' Roll and Rock ' n ' Roll Sessions albums . The photo was taken by J\u00fcrgen Vollmer , during the time The Beatles were playing at the Top Ten club . Individual Beatles later commented about their memories of Hamburg , with Lennon reflecting , \" We 'd outlived the Hamburg stage and wanted to pack that up . We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times . We 'd had that scene . Brian [ Epstein ] made us go back to fulfill the contract ... \" . Harrison had positive memories of the period : \" I 'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times . We didn 't have any luxury , we didn 't have any bathrooms or any clothes , we were pretty grubby , we couldn 't afford anything , but on the other hand we weren 't yet famous , so we didn 't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame . \" McCartney was philosophical : \" Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory . But I think all things are enhanced by time . It was very exciting , though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career , once we 'd started to get a bit of success with the records . \" A memorial square , Beatles-Platz , was constructed in Hamburg in 2008 at the meeting of Reeperbahn and Gro\u00dfe Freiheit streets , containing five stainless steel sculptures of the Beatles . Construction costs amounted to \u20ac 550,000 ( $ 776,000 ) , of which \u20ac 200,000 was provided by sponsors and donors . The idea of creating a memorial to the Beatles had been initiated in 2001 by Hamburg radio station Oldie 95 . Hamburg 's Mayor , Ole von Beust , said at the opening , \" It is about time that Hamburg commemorated this great group . \" The square when illuminated resembles a spinning turntable . Because the band members are shown only in outline form , the figure of the drummer can be either Best or Starr .",

It was written and composed , as a collaboration between all the members of the band , for their second album , A Rush of Blood to the Head . Built around a piano riff , the song features cryptic lyrics of contrast and urgency themes . Several remixes of the track exist and its riff has been widely sampled . \" Clocks \" debuted to critical and commercial success , with critics mainly commenting on the song 's piano melody . It was released in the United Kingdom as the third single from A Rush of Blood to the Head , where it reached number nine in the UK Singles Chart . It was released in the United States as the album 's second single , it reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 9 on Billboard 's Modern Rock Tracks chart . It won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year . = = Background and writing = = \" Clocks \" was written and composed during the late stages of production of Coldplay 's second album , A Rush of Blood to the Head . A riff popped into Chris Martin 's mind late one night in Liverpool when he came in to the studio , where he then developed it on piano . According to Martin , \" Clocks \" was inspired by the English rock band Muse . Martin presented the riff to the band 's guitarist , Jonny Buckland , who then added a layer of guitar chords to the basic track : \" He picked up his guitar [ a sure sign that he likes a song ] and played these brilliant chords ... It was like a chemical reaction process . \" ( The syncopated piano arpeggio that gives the song its signature sound also bears a similarity to a syncopated arpeggio that is repeated several times in Alex De Grassi 's 1981 instrumental \" Clockwork . \" ) Before writing and composing \" Clocks , \" the band had already written 10 songs for the album . But as they thought it was too late for the song 's inclusion in the album , since A Rush Of Blood To The Head was nearing completion , they recorded a demo and saved it with other unfinished tracks , labeling it \" Songs for # 3 ; \" the band projected these tracks for what would be their third album . By June 2002 , Coldplay were ready to present the album to their record label Parlophone . However , Martin felt it was \" rubbish ; \" they were so far from being completely satisfied with the album that both the band and Parlophone delayed the release . After a headlining tour , Coldplay went on working \" Songs for # 3 . \" Phil Harvey , a friend of Martin and the band 's manager , heard it and egged him on to rework \" Clocks \" immediately . With lyrics that speak of urgency , Harvey pointed out that its meaning would contradict Martin 's idea of stashing the track . Thus persuaded by Harvey , Martin then further developed \" Clocks , \" while other band members supplemented their ideas based on the main piano track , adding bass and drums . Coldplay recorded the song very quickly , since they were running after the postponed schedule of A Rush of Blood to the Head , which was released two months later . = = Composition = = \" Clocks \" has a repeating piano melody , and features a minimalist soundscape of drums and bass guitar . Martin applied an ostinato , with emphasis that imitates a three against two polyrhythm , as well as a descending scale on the piano chord progression , which switches from major to minor chords . The music of \" Clocks \" is also provided using synthesizers and a sparse string arrangement . The themes of the lyrics include contrast , contradictions and urgency . According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News , \" Martin seems to address the helplessness of being in a dysfunctional relationship he doesn 't necessarily want to escape . \" The lyrics are cryptic ; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion : \" Come out upon my seas / Cursed missed opportunities / Am I a part of the cure / Or am I part of the disease ? \" The song 's title also \" metaphorically alludes \" to its lyrics , \" pushing one to wonder about the world 's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory : make the best of it when we \u2019 re here , present and alive . \" The song is in the key of E flat Mixolydian , with a main chord progression of E \u266d - B \u266d m - Fm . = = Personnel = = Chris Martin \u2013 lead vocals , piano , synthesizer Jonny Buckland \u2013 electric guitar Guy Berryman \u2013 bass guitar Will Champion \u2013 drums , backing vocals = = Release and music video = = Coldplay released \" Clocks \" in Europe on 24 March 2003 as the album 's third single . The single was issued with two B-sides : \" Animals , \" which was one of the band 's favourite songs performed on tour but was not included in the album , and \" Crests of Waves . \" The single 's cover , created by S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8 as with the album 's and its other singles , is a portrayal of Chris Martin . Across the United States , while preparing \" The Scientist \" as the album 's second release , Coldplay 's US label felt the song failed to \" provide enough of a blood rush for American listeners ; \" instead , they released \" Clocks \" as the second single in the US . A music video was filmed in support of the song . It was directed by British film maker Dominic Leung , and shot at Docklands ' ExCeL Building in London . It features the band performing the song , with a laser show , in front of a staged audience , mostly local college students .

                    "text": "Gorgeous ( Kanye West song ) = \" Gorgeous \" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West from his fifth studio album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) . The track features a hook provided by Kid Cudi , a recording artist formerly signed to West 's label GOOD Music , and a rap verse provided by the Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon . The song was written by West , Cudi , Raekwon , No I.D. , Mike Dean and Rhymefest , and was produced by West , No I.D. and Dean . It contains elements of The Turtles 's cover version of the song \" You Showed Me \" . \" Gorgeous \" received mostly positive reviews from music critics , who generally praised the intricacy of the production , the quality of the guest features and the rock music inspired aesthetic of the song . Several critics cited West 's verses as a highlight of the track , complimenting his lyricism and delivery . Before its release , West premiered an a cappella version of the song in the form of a freestyle rap on Funkmaster Flex 's Hot 97 radio show . Despite not being released as a single , the song appeared on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . Cudi and West performed the song live at SXSW , and West performed the track at the Lollapalooza musical festival . \" Gorgeous \" was also utilized in West 's short film Runaway . = = Background = = The majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was recorded in Oahu , Hawaii , including \" Gorgeous \" . Following several media controversies , West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with . The song features rapper and occasional singer Kid Cudi , a performer West once described as his favorite artist . The two had previously collaborated on West 's fourth album 808s & Heartbreak , an album that served as a big influence on Cudi . As a friend of West , Cudi was invited to Hawaii to listen to recording sessions of the album . One day when Cudi was hanging around the studio , he overheard the composition of \" Gorgeous \" , which he was overwhelmed by . He asked immediately to be featured on the track . While a majority of the artists who worked on the album passed their time playing games of basketball , Cudi smoked marijuana and worked-out on a treadmill in preparation of the recording of his lines . On the recording of the song , Cudi mused ; \u201c Gorgeous was one of those records that , as soon as I heard the beat , I was like , \u2018 Man , this is the one . This is that ' This Can \u2019 t Be Life ' Kanye beat . This is that classic \u2018 [ Kan ] Ye beat . I want to be on this . \u2019 I came up to him , and I was like , \u2018 Man , are you working on this record ? Are you working on this beat ? \u2019 He goes , \u2018 Yeah \u2026 do you got an idea for it ? \u2019 I was like , \u2018 Yeah , I might . I didn \u2019 t . I was lying like a motherfucker . I was like , \u2018 Yeah , man , I want to get on this joint . \u201d Cudi commented that the way the song was recorded was similar to the way prior collaborations between the two were recorded ; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas . In an interview with MTV Cudi commented , \" that 's always our collab formula , and that 's just how ' Gorgeous ' came about . He just kind of told me what he was trying to say , I threw out some words , we rearranged words , and we came out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook . \" It was announced that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song , who West had invited to Hawaii . Raekwon initially had no interest in working with West musically , and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him . According to the rapper , a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don 't want to help their competition , comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel . One of the reasons for Raekwon 's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan , RZA , spoke positively of West . RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan , and praised his skills as a producer . RZA was a part of the recording sessions for the album in Hawaii , and contributed to the production of songs \" Dark Fantasy \" and \" So Appalled \" . Eventually after being impressed by West himself , Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks , including \" Gorgeous \" . Raekwon described West as a hard worker , and stated that the \" first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he 's a hard worker . When you look at him , you can tell that he still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones . \" = = Composition = = \" Gorgeous \" is a bluesy , rock-driven song that features West 's thoughts on social injustice . Other topics such as sexual exploitation and social disillusionment are expressed throughout the track . It contains elements of The Turtles 's cover version of the song \" You Showed Me \" , which is where the guitar riff is derived . The song opens with a melodic electric guitar chord , erupting into the hook provided by Cudi . The production style found within the song is noticeably more subdued than average West compositions , quietly playing aongside the lush guitar playing . West muses about social issues and comments on his past critics , rapping at a modest pace over the guitar-driven production . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented on West 's lyrical presentation on the track and compared him to rapper Jay-Z , writing \" on ' Gorgeous ' he sneers at the competition , ' you blowing up ? / that \u2019 s good / fantastic ' , maybe the iciest blow-off since ' Jay-Z \u2019 s You got a little dough ? That \u2019 s cool with me . ' \" Sputnikmusic 's Channing Freeman felt that the song was \" broodingly slow \" and that it was \" driven by piano chords and a questing electric guitar . \" Dan Vidal of URB commented on the intricacy of the lyrics : \" On ' Gorgeous , ' he treats his distorted vocals as if they were another instrument to be blended seamlessly into the mix alongside the muted electric guitar-riff . He spits : Penitentiary chances , the devil dances / and eventually answers to the call of autumn / all them fallin \u2019 , for the love of ballin \u2019 / get caught with 30 rocks , the cop look like Alec Baldwin . This track is an excellent microcosm of the album because it exemplifies the pinnacle of Ye \u2019 s visionary talent . \u201d The line \" choke a South Park writer with a fishstick \" is a reference to the South Park episode \" Fishsticks \" which parodied West . While he enjoyed the episode , it reportedly hurt his feelings . MTV highlighted the full verse , which goes ; \" but this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus / Ready for the world 's games / This is my Olympics / We make ' em say ' ho ' cause the game is so pimpish / Choke a ' South Park ' writer with a fish stick . \" The line \" What 's a black beetle anyway , a roach ? \" is a reference to The Beatles . = = Reception = = The song attracted widespread praise by music critics , many of whom ranked it among West 's best songs . Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Dombal compared elements of the song to the rock band The Strokes , and stated that it contained some of the best lyrics ever written by West . Dan Vidal of URB largely praised the track , writing that it was an excellent song overall , though wrote that \" in my personal opinion , I don \u2019 t really think Kid Cudi can sing ; and I \u2019 m not sure why his generally off-key caterwauling is appealing to people , but here it \u2019 s hypnotically on point \u2013 matching perfectly with the track \u2019 s imposing tone . \" MTV wrote that the song featured West at his most boastful lyrically , musing that \" while his lyrics are razor sharp , the production here is softer , resulting in a melodic finger wag to his naysayers rather than searing jabs . \" David Amidon of PopMatters praised the performance by West on the song but felt that neither guest appearance ultimately left much of an impression . On the other hand , Sputnikmusic 's Channing Freeman felt that both Cudi and Raekwon fit perfectly on the guitar-driven track . Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield wrote \" nobody else is making music this daring and weird \" and described the song as \" spooky space funk \" . The Washington Post 's Chris Richards stated \" West 's moment of post-Beatles anxiety comes during ' Gorgeous , ' a song that moans and groans with a dark urgency that permeates this album . \" Entertainment Weekly 's Simon Vozick-Levinson described the song as \" narcissistic \" and noted West 's insults of his critics in the song . Alex Denney of NME praised West 's sense of humor on the song and praised the guitar work . Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine called West 's first verse on the song a \" bilious rant about racial inequality \" . AbsolutePunk 's Drew Beringer stated that West sounded angry on the song , and viewed that it contained some of his best lyrics . Andrew Barber of Complex stated that the track had several quotable lines , and commented that West was a \" frontrunner \" for hip-hop 's best producers and rappers combinations . Barber called Cudi 's hook excellent , and mused that the \" guitar riff on the beat will stay stuck in your head for days . \" The song charted at 23 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart as reported by Billboard , however it only spent one week on the chart . The song also appeared on the South Korean Gaon Chart at 86 . = = Marketing = = The song was also featured during the third scene of Runaway , a 35-minute music video directed by West set to music from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . The song plays during the scene where Selita Ebanks ' character inspects around the garden , interacting with the animals and plants , while Kanye watches her from inside . Cudi and West performed the song together at the SXSW musical festival . During the 2011 Lollapalooza festival in Chile , \" Gorgeous \" was featured on the setlist . West also performed an a cappella version of the song during a concert in New York . A case of pre-release promotion was exhibited when West , performed a freestyle of the song on Hot 97 . The lyrics from the freestyle later became \" Gorgeous \" . West performed the freestyle alongside Pusha T , a rapper signed to his GOOD Music Label . = = Chart positions = =",

                    "text": "Julia Baird = Julia Baird ( n\u00e9e Dykins ) ( born 5 March 1947 ) is the younger half-sister of English musician John Lennon and is the eldest daughter of John ' Bobby ' Albert Dykins ( 1918 \u2013 December 1965 ) and Julia Lennon ( 12 March 1914 \u2013 15 July 1958 ) . she also had an older half-sister , Ingrid Pedersen . Her younger sister was Jacqueline ' Jackie ' Dykins ( born 26 October 1949 ) . Lennon started visiting the Dykins ' house in 1951 . After the death of Julia Lennon in 1958 , Harriet and Norman Birch were appointed guardians of Julia and Jackie , ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married their mother . Lennon invited the Dykins sisters to visit after the success of the Beatles , when he was living in Kenwood , Weybridge , with his then-wife , Cynthia Lennon . Julia Dykins ( Baird ) married Allen Baird in 1968 and moved to Belfast . They had three children together but were divorced in 1981 . Baird worked as a special needs teacher , and after Lennon 's death she wrote John Lennon , My Brother ( with Geoffrey Giuliano ) and gave up working in 2004 to write Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon . She is now a director of Cavern City Tours in Liverpool . = = Early years = = Baird 's mother , Julia Lennon , was the fourth of five children in the Stanley family : Mary , known as ' Mimi ' ( 1906 \u2013 1991 ) , Elizabeth ' Mater ' ( 1908 \u2013 1976 ) , Anne ' Nanny ' ( 1911 \u2013 1988 ) , Julia ' Judy ' ( 1914 \u2013 1958 ) , and Harriet ' Harrie ' ( 1916 \u2013 1972 ) . John Lennon was Julia 's first child by Alfred Lennon , although she later had a daughter called Victoria ( renamed Ingrid ) after an affair with a Welsh soldier while Alfred was at sea . Julia was forced to give up the child for adoption after intense pressure from her father and her sisters . Although they had known each other previously , Julia started dating Dykins while working in a caf\u00e9 near Mosspits , which was Lennon 's primary school . Dykins was said to be a good-looking , well-dressed man who was several years older than Julia and worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward . Julia later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins , who had access to rationed goods like alcohol , chocolate , silks and cigarettes . The Stanley sisters called Dykins a \" spiv \" , because of his pencil-thin moustache , margarine-coated hair , and pork-pie hat , but the young Lennon called him \" Twitchy \" because of a physical tic and nervous cough Dykins had . Although Julia never divorced Alfred Lennon , she was the common-law wife of Dykins , although Paul McCartney admitted to being sarcastic to Lennon about his mother living in sin while Julia was still married . Julia 's sister , Mimi , called Julia and Dykins ' home \u2014 at 1 Blomfield Road , Liverpool \u2014 \" The House of Sin \" and her own house ( where Lennon lived ) \" The House of Correction \" . When Jackie was born prematurely on 26 October 1949 , Julia went back to the hospital every day to see her , although she was often not allowed ( by Mimi ) to visit Lennon . Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool , which allowed Julia to stay at home at Blomfield Road , to look after Baird , Jackie , a cat named \" Elvis \" , and the 11-year-old Lennon , who had started to visit and occasionally stayed overnight . Baird would give up her bed to Lennon , and share Jackie 's double bed . Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money ( one shilling ) for doing odd jobs , such as collecting golf balls on the local course , on top of the five shillings that Lennon 's Aunt Mimi gave him . During Lennon 's visits , he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie , test Baird 's spelling , and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend . Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them , her mother would often play a record called , My Son John , To Me You Are So Wonderful , \" by some old crooner , and sit and listen to it \" . \" My Son John \" \u2014 sung by David Whitfield \u2014 was released in 1956 . Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt 's croft in Sango Bay , Durness , Scotland , for his holidays , he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family . Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street , Liverpool , to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen on the back of a flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957 . Baird was allowed to sit on the back , but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off . The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool 's charter by King John . Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road because they said the acoustics \" sounded like a recording studio \" . = = = Legal guardian = = = Baird 's mother was struck and killed on 15 July 1958 , just outside Mimi 's home , by a Standard Vanguard car driven by an off-duty constable , PC Eric Clague , who was a learner-driver . Clague later said : \" Mrs Lennon just ran straight out in front of me . I just couldn 't avoid her . I was not speeding , I swear it . It was just one of those terrible things that happen . \" Baird and Jackie ( aged eleven and eight respectively ) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater 's , and were not allowed to attend the funeral . They were told two months later by Norman Birch ( Lennon 's uncle ) that their mother had died . Lennon 's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls \u2014 ignoring Dykins ' parentage , as he had never legally married Julia . Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool . Her grave is unmarked , and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . Baird and Jackie were taken to live with the Birches and their son at The Dairy Cottage , which was owned by Mimi 's husband , George Smith . At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself , where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House , although Baird and her friends called it \" frothy coffee \" . At 16 , Baird started to hitch-hike to London , although her Aunt never knew , as she would never have allowed it . Baird talked about the trips to London , and how relatively safe they were : \" Hitching was easy then . It was a way of life . Everything was becoming more free . We 'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties . People always gave us a place to stay \u2013 we were never harmed . \" Baird and Jackie were asked to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964 . Cynthia Lennon \u2014 Lennon 's wife at the time \u2014 took them both out shopping in Knightsbridge , buying them expensive clothes . During the same visit , The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria , and the sisters asked to be allowed to stand near the front , but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush . In December 1965 , Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane . Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards . Dykins had married again , but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife , and did not attend their father 's funeral . In 1968 , Lennon was told The Dairy Cottage was too cramped for them all , so he told Birch to buy a house , and he found a 4-bedroom house in Gateacre Park Drive , Liverpool . Lennon told Birch to furnish and decorate it , and to send all the bills to him . The Dykinses heard nothing from Lennon for years , until he phoned Baird in 1975 , and asked for mementos of his childhood life , such as his school tie and photographs . He sent \u00a3 3,000 to cover the cost of shipping and as a gift , but wrote , \" Don 't tell Mimi \" . Lennon continued to call Baird until 1976 , when the calls stopped . Jackie worked as a shop assistant during the 1970s , but battled against a heroin addiction . In the 1980s , and fully recovered , Jackie gave birth to her son , John , later working as a hairstylist . After Lennon and Harriet died , Yoko Ono wanted to sell the house \u2014 as it was still in Lennon 's name \u2014 but later gave it to the Salvation Army on 2 November 1993 , even though Lennon had once written : \" I always thought of the house he 's in [ Birch ] as my contribution towards looking after Julia [ Baird ] and Jackie . I would prefer the girls to use it . \" = = Later years = = Julia married Allen Baird in 1968 , they moved to Belfast and kept her family history a secret . The Bairds had three children : Nicholas ( b . 1971 ) , Sara ( b . 1972 ) and David ( b . 1980 ) , and were divorced in 1981 . Baird went to university and gained an MA in philosophy of education , and during her the course of her degree she spent a year off in France , hitch-hiked around Europe , and protested against the war in Vietnam in Paris alongside Simone de Beauvoir . Baird later taught French and English before working as a special needs teacher with teenagers in deprived areas of Chester , until she retired to write books and become a director of Cavern City Tours . Baird and Jackie met their half-sister Ingrid Pedersen for the first time when they were present at the ceremony to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi 's house , commemorating the fact that Lennon had lived there . Baird and Jackie had only recently found out who Pedersen was , after being told by journalist Bill Smithies of the Liverpool Echo . Baird was shocked that Pedersen did not look anything like the Stanley or the Lennon family , having pale blue eyes and fair hair . After releasing the book , John Lennon , My Brother \u2014 written with Giuliano , and a foreword by McCartney \u2014 Baird travelled to New York during 1989 to appear at a Beatlefest convention , and was asked if she could prove she was really Lennon 's half-sister . Baird declined , saying she was not going to produce her passport , and the audience would just have to take her word for it . In 2000 , Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs , erected on major routes into Liverpool , saying , \" Liverpool welcomes you \u2013 to the birthplace of THE BEATLES \" , and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool 's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon 's birthday . Baird retired in 2004 , and published a book called Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon , in February 2007 . From 28 to 30 September 2007 , Durness held the John Lennon Northern Lights Festival which was attended by Baird ( who read from Lennon 's writings and her own books ) and Stanley Parkes ( Lennon 's Scottish cousin ) . Parkes said , \" Me and Julia [ Baird ] are going to be going to the old family croft to tell stories \" . Musicians , painters and poets from across the UK performed at the festival . Baird now lives in Chester with her partner , Roger Keys . Baird claims she was never told that her mother was buried in the Allerton Cemetery , in Liverpool , although the graveyard 's location is approximately 1.19 miles east of 1 Blomfield Road . The grave was unmarked , but was recently identified as \" CE ( Church of England ) 38-805 \" . The Stanley family finally put a headstone on her mother 's grave . The headstone reads : Mummy John Victoria Julie Jackie .",
