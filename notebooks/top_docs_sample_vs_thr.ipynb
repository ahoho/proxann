The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value , when it exists , is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point . The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value .

The delta function is sometimes thought of as a hypothetical function whose graph is an infinitely high , infinitely thin spike at the origin , with total area one under the spike , and physically represents the density of an idealized point mass or point charge . It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac . From a purely mathematical viewpoint , the Dirac delta is not strictly a function , because any extended-real function that is equal to zero everywhere but a single point must have total integral zero . The delta function only makes sense as a mathematical object when it appears inside an integral . From this perspective the Dirac delta can usually be manipulated as though it were a function .

       "      <td>Matrix ( mathematics ) = In mathematics , a matrix ( plural matrices ) is a rectangular array of numbers , symbols , or expressions , arranged in rows and columns . The dimensions of matrix ( 1 ) are 2 × 3 ( read \" two by three \" ) , because there are two rows and three columns . The individual items in a matrix are called its elements or entries . Provided that they are the same size ( have the same number of rows and the same number of columns ) , two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element . The rule for matrix multiplication , however , is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second . Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field . A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations , that is , generalizations of linear functions such as f ( x ) = 4x . For example , the rotation of vectors in three dimensional space is a linear transformat</td>\n",

Furthermore , Hilbert spaces are complete : there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used .

Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis , largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure . Although analytically often considered to be religious , those involved in it typically prefer the designation of \" spiritual \" and rarely use the term \" New Age \" themselves . Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement , although others contest this term , believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon . As a form of Western esotericism , the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions , in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century .

       "5  Derivative = The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of a quantity ( a function value or dependent variable ) which is determined by another quantity ( the independent variable ) . Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus . For example , the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object 's velocity : this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time is advanced . The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value , when it exists , is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point . The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value . For this reason , the derivative is often described as the \" instantaneous rate of change \" , the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable . Derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables .    \n",

       "5  Dirac delta function = In mathematics , the Dirac delta function , or δ function , is a generalized function , or distribution , on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero , with an integral of one over the entire real line . The delta function is sometimes thought of as a hypothetical function whose graph is an infinitely high , infinitely thin spike at the origin , with total area one under the spike , and physically represents the density of an idealized point mass or point charge . It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac . From a purely mathematical viewpoint , the Dirac delta is not strictly a function , because any extended-real function that is equal to zero everywhere but a single point must have total integral zero . The delta function only makes sense as a mathematical object when it appears inside an integral . From this perspective the Dirac delta can usually be manipulated as though it were a function .

Provided that they are the same size ( have the same number of rows and the same number of columns ) , two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element . The rule for matrix multiplication , however , is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second . Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field . A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations , that is , generalizations of linear functions such as f ( x ) = 4x .

Moreover , a dictator novel often is an allegory for the role of the writer in a Latin American society . Although mostly associated with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s , the dictator-novel genre has its roots in the nineteenth-century novel Facundo ( 1845 ) , by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento . As an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas 's dictatorial régime in Argentina , Facundo is the forerunner of the dictator novel genre ; all subsequent dictator novels hearken back to it . As established by Sarmiento , the goal of the genre is not to analyze the rule of particular dictators , or to focus on historical accuracy    \n",

By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget . The Civil aviation industry , represented by Aeroflot , was the largest in the world , but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR 's collapse .
