                "Second Battle of Kehl ( 1796 ) = The Second Battle of Kehl occurred on 18 September 1796 , when General Franz Petrasch 's Austrian and Imperial troops stormed the French-held bridgehead over the Rhine river . The village of Kehl , which is now in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg , was then part of Baden-Durlach . Across the river , Strasbourg , an Alsatian city , was a French Revolutionary stronghold . This battle was part of the Rhine Campaign of 1796 , in the French Revolutionary War of the First Coalition . In the 1790s , the Rhine was wild , unpredictable , and difficult to cross . Its channels and tributaries created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during the dry seasons . A complex of bridges , gates , fortifications and barrage dams linked Kehl with Strasbourg . These had been constructed by the fortress architect S\u00e9bastien le Pr\u00e9stre de Vauban in the seventeenth century . The crossings had been contested before : in 1678 during the French-Dutch war , in 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession , in 1733 during the War of the Polish Succession , and earlier in Battle of Kehl , when the French crossed into the German states on 23 \u2013 24 June . Critical to French success would be the army 's ability to cross the Rhine at will . The crossings at H\u00fcningen , near the Swiss city of Basel , and at Kehl , offered access to most of southwestern Germany ; from there , French armies could sweep north , south , or east , depending on their military goal . In late summer of 1796 , the Austrian force reacquired most of the territory lost to the French earlier in the summer . On 18 September 1796 , the Austrians temporarily acquired control of the t\u00eate-du-ponts ( bridgeheads ) joining Kehl and Strasbourg until a strong French counter-attack forced them to retreat , leaving the French in control of the bridges but the Austrians in control of the territory surrounding them . The situation remained in status quo until late October . Control of the surrounding territory there prevented the French from crossing to safety in Strasbourg , and required the French commander , Jean Victor Marie Moreau , to withdraw toward Basel . Immediately after the Battle of Schliengen ( 24 October 1796 ) , while most of Moreau 's army retreated south to cross the Rhine at H\u00fcningen , Count Baillet Latour moved his Austrian force to Kehl to begin a 100-day siege . = = Background : general campaign of 1796 = = The campaign of 1796 was part of the larger , broader French Revolutionary Wars in which republican France pitted itself against a fluid coalition of Prussians and Austrians and several other states of the Holy Roman Empire , the British , Sardinians , Dutch , and royalist French emigres . Although initially the republican French experienced several victories , the campaigns of 1793 through 1795 had been less successful . However , the Coalition partners had difficulty coordinating their war aims , and their own efforts also faltered . In 1794 and 1795 , French victories in northern Italy salvaged French enthusiasm for the war , and forced the Coalition to withdraw further into Central Europe . At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795 , the Habsburg Austrian Coalition and the French Republican called a truce between their forces that had been fighting in Germany . This agreement lasted until 20 May 1796 , when the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May . The Austrian Coalition 's Army of the Lower Rhine included 90,000 troops . The 20,000-man right wing , first under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W\u00fcrttemberg , then Wilhelm von Wartensleben , stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River , observing the French bridgehead at D\u00fcsseldorf . The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress included 10,000 more . The remainder of the Imperial and Coalition army , the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine , secured the west bank behind the Nahe River . Commanded by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser , this force anchored its right wing in Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Szt\u00e1ray , Michael von Fr\u00f6hlich and Louis Joseph , Prince of Cond\u00e9 guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland . The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on the west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn . After news arrived in Vienna of Napoleon Bonaparte 's successes , however , Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements , and the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground . On the French side , the 80,000-man Army of Sambre-et-Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to Sankt Wendel . On the army 's left flank , Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber had 22,000 troops in an entrenched camp at D\u00fcsseldorf . The right wing of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle was positioned behind the Rhine from H\u00fcningen northward , centered along the Queich River near Landau , and its left wing extended west toward Saarbr\u00fccken . Pierre Marie Barth\u00e9lemy Ferino led Moreau 's right wing at H\u00fcningen , Louis Desaix commanded the center and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the left wing . Ferino 's wing consisted of three infantry and cavalry divisions under Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Louis Bourcier and Henri Fran\u00e7ois Delaborde . Desaix 's command included three divisions led by Michel de Beaupuy , Antoine Guillaume Delmas and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles . Saint-Cyr 's wing had two divisions commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme and Alexandre Camille Taponier . The French plan called for a springtime ( April-May-June ) offensive during which the two armies would press against the flanks of the northern Coalition armies in the German states while a third army approached Vienna through Italy . Specifically , Jean-Baptiste Jourdan 's army would push south from D\u00fcsseldorf , hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves , while Moreau 's army massed on the east side of the Rhine by Mannheim . According to plan , Jourdan 's army feinted toward Mannheim , and Charles repositioned his troops . Once this occurred , Moreau 's army endured a forced march south and attacked the bridgehead at Kehl , which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops \u2014 troops recruited that spring from the Swabian Circle polities , inexperienced and untrained \u2014 which held the bridgehead for several hours , but then retreated toward Rastatt . Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard , and his troops poured into Baden unhindered . In the south , by Basel , Ferino 's column moved quickly across the river and advanced up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline toward Lake Constance , spreading into the southern end of the Black Forest . Worried that his supply lines would be overextended or his army would be flanked , Charles began a retreat to the east . At this point , in July , the jealousies and competition between the French generals came into play . Moreau could have joined up with Jourdan 's army in the north , but did not ; he proceeded eastward , pushing Charles into Bavaria , while Jourdan pushed eastward , pushing Wartensleben 's autonomous corps into the Ernestine duchies . On either side , the union of two armies \u2014 Wartensleben 's with Charles ' or Jourdan 's with Moreau 's \u2014 could have crushed their opposition . In August , Wartensleben 's autonomous corps united with Charles ' imperial troops and turned the tide against the French . The defeat of Jourdan 's army at the battles of Amberg ( 24 August ) , W\u00fcrzburg ( 3 September ) and 2nd Altenkirchen ( 16 \u2013 19 September ) allowed Charles to move more troops to the south , and effectively removed Jourdan from the remainder of the campaign . = = = Preliminary action at Bruchsal : September 1796 = = = While Charles and Moreau jockeyed for position on the eastern slope of the Black Forest , Franz Petrasch engaged the French at Bruchsal . The troops there , commanded by Marc Amand \u00c9lis\u00e9e Scherb , included the 68th Demi-brigade and two squadrons of the 19th Dragoons ; they had remained behind after the Battle of Ettlingen to observe the garrisons of Mannheim and Philippsburg . Realizing that his command was too small to withstand a concerted attack by the stronger Austrians , Scherb withdrew toward Kehl to secure the Rhine crossing to Strasburg , since Moreau , now well into a retreat across the mountains , would need the crossing for a safe passage to France . An initial Austrian attack on the French position at Bruchsal favored the French , who charged the Austrians with bayonets . Again , on 5 and 6 September , the Austrians spent most of the day skirmishing with the French at their advanced posts , masking their intention of circling around Bruchsal and marching south to secure the crossing to Strasbourg . General Scherb received intelligence of a contingent of infantry and cavalry marching against him and retired south . Scherb found the Austrians already in possession of Untergrombach , a village south of Bruchsal . After he tried to force his way through , the Austrians fell back to Weingarten at 49 \u00b0 3 \u2032 5 \u2033 N 8 \u00b0 31 \u2032 50 \u2033 E. Scherb found himself caught between detachments of Austrians by the Kinzig river and behind him . General Moreau deployed a demi-brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry from his army in the Black Forest , with instructions to proceed by forced marches to Kehl , but General Petrasch , acting on his own intelligence , sent Konstantin d 'Aspr\u00e9 with two battalions to occupy Renchen , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Kehl . This effectively prevented Moreau 's reinforcements from reaching Kehl and locked Scherb in place . The undermanned garrison at Kehl was on its own . = = = Kehl garrison status 16 \u2013 17 September = = = The Kehl garrison consisted of one battalion of the 24th Demi-brigade and some detachments of the 104th under command of Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg . This was too weak a force to defend a position of such importance , or to develop additional extensive works . Moreau reported that some of Scherb 's troops had arrived , but it is unclear which ones . Furthermore , the lack of cooperation from local peasant workers and the exhaustion of troops prevented the enhancements of the fortifications from proceeding with any speed . On the evening of 16 September , Petrasch and most of his column had arrived at Bischofsheim , immediately by Kehl , with three battalions and two squadrons ; more troops were not far behind . By 17 September , a small corps of Austrians approached the outskirts of Kehl and vigorously attacked the French sentries there ; this was merely a prelude to the more significant action the following day . = = Action of 18 September = = Before the break of dawn on 18 September ( 03 : 45 ) , three Austrian columns attacked Kehl , while another kept Scherb pinned down by the Kinzig . The Austrian principal column , comprising the 38th Regiment , crossed the Kinzig river above the French position and proceeded toward the dykes of the Rhine above ( south of ) Kehl . This placed them between Scherb 's force and Kehl . Using the dykes as protection , and conducted by some peasants familiar with the fortifications , they advanced as far as the horn work on the Upper Rhine and entered a gorge which led them to the outskirts of Kehl . The second column of the 38th Regiment , under command of Major Busch , proceeded via the hamlet of Sundheim toward Kehl , and obtained possession of the village itself , although not the bridge leading to Strasbourg . The third column , which included three companies of Serbians and a division of Hussars , executed a feint on the left bank of the river . One column of reserve , under the command of Franz Pongratz , approached as far as the French earthworks on the banks of the Rhine to support the columns ahead of him ; another , which included a battalion of the 12th Regiment ( Manfredini ) , moved past the hamlet by Neumuhl at 48 \u00b0 34 \u2032 12 \u2033 N 7 \u00b0 50 \u2032 38 \u2033 E toward Kehl . Quickly , the Austrians acquired control of all the earthworks of the town , the village itself , and the fortress ; their skirmishers reached one side of the abutment of an old bridge of palisades , and advanced to the other side , across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine . There , almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels , they halted ; there is some confusion about why they stopped . Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself , as Moreau seemed to think . Regardless , the troops there did not burn the bridge , but started plundering and drinking . The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge , but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them . The French executed several attempts to retake the bridges . The 68th , under command of general Jean-Baptiste de Sisce , was repulsed three times by the superior numbers of Austrians and the fearsome fire of case shot from four cannons that lined the principal road . Not until 19 : 00 did fortune favor the French , when Colonel d 'Aspr\u00e9 and two hundred men of the Regiment Ferdinand were captured within the fort itself . The next in command , a Major Delas , was badly wounded , leaving no one in overall command of the 38th Regiment . The French general Schauenburg , who had gone to Strasbourg for troops , returned with some reinforcements , including part of the Strasbourg national guard , and led these troops over the pontoon bridges . They met at once an impetuous Austrian attack , but were sufficiently strong to recover . At 22 : 00 , the Austrians still held the redoubt and the houses at the edge of the village ; the arrival of a fresh battalion of the 12th Regiment led to a new attack , but it was repulsed . Ultimately , though , the Austrians had insufficient reserves to meet the fresh troops from Strasbourg . By 23 : 00 , the French had recovered all of the Strasbourg suburbs , the village of Kehl and all of the French earthen works . According to Digby Smith and his sources , the Austrians lost 2,000 men killed , missing and wounded , and the French : 1,200 missing and captured . German sources report , though , that the Austrians lost 1,500 men and 300 prisoners , and the French had 300 dead and 800 wounded . = = Impact of September action = = Despite the limited success of Petrasch 's action , the action had a broad impact on the movements of the main armies of Moreau and Archduke Charles , which still maneuvered to the east . Moreau 's army would debouch through the Black Forest mountains , which lay to the east . By controlling the eastern access to the Kehl / Strasbourg crossing , Petrasch forced Moreau to march south ; any retreat into France would have to occur via the bridges at H\u00fcningen , a longer march , not at Kehl and Strasbourg . The next contact between the main armies occurred on 19 October at Emmendingen in the Elz valley , which winds through the Black Forest . The section of the valley involved in the battle runs south-west through the mountains from Elzach , through Bleibach and Waldkirch . Just to the south-west of Waldkirch , the river emerges from the mountains and flows north-west towards the Rhine , with the Black Forest to its right . This section of the river passes through Emmendingen before it reaches Riegel . Riegel sits in a narrow gap between the Black Forest and an isolated outcropping of volcanic hills known as the Kaiserstuhl . The Austrian and French armies met again at Schliengen on 24 October . Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights , offering him a tactically superior position . Charles threw his army against both flanks ; the French left flank fought stubbornly , but gave way under the pressure of Cond\u00e9 's emigre corps ; the right flank withstood a day-long battering by Latour and Nauendorf , but eventually had to withdraw . The loss of access to the crossing at Kehl forced Moreau to withdraw south to H\u00fcningen . With a strong rear guard provided by Generals Abbatucci and Lariboisi\u00e8re , he abandoned his position the same night and retreated part of the 9.7 miles ( 16 km ) to H\u00fcningen . The right and left wings followed . By 3 November , he had reached Haltingen , where he organized his force to cross over the bridges into France . The Archduke then sent most of his army north to besiege Kehl . = = Orders of battle = = The following troops participated in the action at Kehl . = = = French = = = 24th Demi-brigade de Ligne ( one battalion ) 68th Demi-brigade de Ligne ( three battalions ) 104th Demi-brigade de Ligne ( remnants ) 19th Dragoon Regiment ( two squadrons ) = = = Austrian = = = Infantry Regiment Nr. 12 ( three battalions ) Infantry Regiment Nr. 15 ( three battalions ) Infantry Regiment Nr. 38 ( elements )",
                "Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re = Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re , also Count de Lariboisi\u00e8re , was a general of artillery of the First French Empire . He fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars and died of fatigue at K\u00f6nigsberg in East Prussia on 21 December 1812 , during the Grand Army 's retreat from Moscow . A superb organizer and tactician , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re rose rapidly through the artillery ranks and reliably directed the artillery park for the initial engagements of the War of the First Coalition in 1793 \u2013 1794 . He also directed the investment and , if necessary , the sieges of Mainz , Ulm , and Danzig , among others . In addition , he was a reliable commander of infantry , supporting Laurent Saint-Cyr 's corps in northern Italy in the 1799 campaign . Lariboisi\u00e8re 's direction of artillery fire at the Battle of Austerlitz resulted in the destruction of the ice covering the lake over which Russian army forces retreated . His placement of artillery at the Battle of Borodino gave the French a tactical advantage in fire on the Russian lines . Lariboisi\u00e8re 's artillery also provided the rear guard coverage of the French withdrawal from Beresina . One of his sons survived the wars and the family founded the Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital in Paris . = = Family and education = = He was born on 18 August 1759 , in Foug\u00e8res . His father , Ambroise Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re , was lieutenant general of civil and criminal justice and the senechal of Foug\u00e8res . His mother was Jeanne Monni\u00e8res . Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re was designated early for a military career . He was a brilliant student at the military academy and in 1781 received a commission as a lieutenant and entered the same regiment as Napoleon Bonaparte . Although Lariboisi\u00e8re was a few years older than Bonaparte , they developed a rapport that continued until Lariboisi\u00e8re 's death in 1812 . = = Military career = = Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re was cited as a distinguished officer the outset of the French Revolution , for which he showed only moderate support . He was promoted to captain in 1791 and assigned to Adam Philippe , Comte de Custine 's command . He took part in the invasion of Paville against the Prussians . After the surrender of the French army , he was held as a prisoner of war . In the following years , he participated in the campaigns of 1796 , as adjutant colonel , colonel , and brigadier general , and directed the artillery parks of the Army of England , the Army of Helvetia , the Army of the Rhine . When Jean Baptiste Jourdan organized the Army of the Danube , Lariboisi\u00e8re received command of the artillery park . At the First Battle of Zurich , Lariboisi\u00e8re 's artillery defended the Zurich heights , which gave Andre Massena 's army enough time to evacuate the city and take position on the opposite side of the Limmat river . Afterward , Lariboisi\u00e8re was sent to northern Italy where he commanded the advance guard division ; Jean Victor Moreau 's right wing , with Lariboisi\u00e8re 's infantry and artillery , crossed the Ticino river at Pavia , marched up the left bank of the Po River and took position beneath Alessandria ; there , he protected Moreau 's flank from Russian skirmishers sufficiently for Moreau to establish a large train of artillery in Turin and to strengthen the French positions between the Po and the Tanaro river . At Battle of Novi , his division was part of Laurent Saint-Cyr 's right wing . At the battle itself , his troops were the only ones properly positioned ; the rest of the French army was otherwise out of place and unready for battle . He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line , beating off two Russian assaults . After the French defeat at Novi , he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona , where he participated in operations around Genoa . Eventually , he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany , culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden . = = = Napoleonic Wars = = = Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re commanded the artillery of the French IV Corps for the 1805 campaign of the War of the Third Coalition . He directed the investment of Ulm prior to its capitulation , and contributed to the success of Austerlitz . There he commanded the artillery attached to Soult corps . By firing on the ice of the lakes over which the Russian columns were retreating , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re 's artillery fire converted a Russian retreat into a full-scale rout : in the bombardment , French artillery pounded the soldiers and broke the ice . The men drowned in the cold ponds , dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down along with them . In the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re successfully repelled several infantry charges with artillery fire . Subsequently , Napoleon raised him to major general , and appointed him to command the artillery of the Imperial Guard at Battle of Eylau , in February 1807 . Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re remained throughout the day-long battle with a battery of 40 guns at the French center . After the campaigns of 1806 , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re briefly served as governor of Hanover . He later replaced General Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons prior to the engagements in northeastern Prussia in 1807 . At the Battle of Danzig , although wounded by a sniper 's bullet , he continued to direct the siege of the city . He directed the Imperial guard artillery for the battles of Heilsberg and Friedland ; after Friedland , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re organized the security of the raft on the Niemen river , where Napoleon and Alexander II of Russia conferred on the terms of the Peace of Tilsit . In February 1808 , General Lariboisi\u00e8re took command of the artillery of the Army of Spain . Recalled to the Grand Army in 1809 , Napoleon gave the command of the artillery at the Battle of Wagram . In 1811 Napoleon raised him to the post of first inspector general of ordnance \u2014 weaponry and ammunition . = = Russian campaign , 1812 = = In planning the Russian campaign , 1812 , Lariboisi\u00e8re immediately foresaw difficulties in transporting the requisite amount of artillery and ammunition the vast distance from the Nieman river into Russia . The army left Prussia with over 1100 artillery pieces of various kinds and sizes . Despite heavy rain , the French arrived in Vilnius ; despite the mud , the artillery was established prior to the battle and contributed with successful targeted fire . On the evening before the Battle of Borodino , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re scouted the Russian positions to determine the means of bombarding the redoubts that the Russians had established on their left . During the night , he strategically placed the French artillery park ; at daybreak , the artillery bombarded the Russian positions , firing over 70,000 rounds . One of Lariboisi\u00e8re 's sons ( Ferdinand ) , was fatally wounded in a charge on the Russian lines at Borodino . Grief-stricken and exhausted with fatigue , the general fell sick in Vilnius and died in K\u00f6nigsberg on 21 December 1812 . = = Legacy = = His body rests in the church of les Invalides , and on his coffin is the following inscription : Ambroise Baston , Count of La Riboisi\u00e8re , major general , commanding the artillery of the Grande Arm\u00e9e , Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor , born in Foug\u00e8res , died at K\u00f6nigsberg , December 21 , 1812 . The General 's heart is hosted in a private chapel near his castle of Monthorin at Louvign\u00e9-du-D\u00e9sert , in Brittany . Honor\u00e9-Charles Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re , another of his sons , also served in the artillery . He survived not only the Battle of Borodino in which his brother ( Ferdinand ) was killed , but also the retreat from Moscow and the subsequent campaigns in Prussia and Saxony . He served in the Chamber of Deputies and was raised to the peerage of France . He founded the H\u00f4pital Lariboisi\u00e8re .",
                "Battle of Cobleskill = The Battle of Cobleskill ( also known as the Cobleskill massacre ) was an American Revolutionary War raid on the frontier settlement of Cobleskill , New York on May 30 , 1778 . The battle , having taken place in the modern-day village of Warnerville , NY near Cobleskill-Richmondville High School , marked the beginning of a phase in which Loyalists and Iroquois , encouraged and supplied by British authorities in the Province of Quebec , raided and destroyed numerous villages on what was then the United States western frontier of New York and Pennsylvania . A small party of Iroquois entered Cobleskill and drew the local defenders into a trap set by a much larger party of Iroquois and Loyalists under the command of Joseph Brant . After killing a number of the militia and driving off the remainder , Brant 's forces destroyed much of the settlement . New York 's defenders retaliated against Brant 's actions against Cobleskill and other communities by destroying Iroquois villages later in the year , and Continental Army forces destroyed more Iroquois villages in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 . = = Background = = With the failure of British General John Burgoyne 's campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 , the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war . British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments . During the winter of 1777 \u2013 78 Brant and other British-allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania . In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga ( present-day Windsor , New York ) . He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May . One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler , who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley . In 1778 the settlement of Cobleskill , New York consisted of twenty families living on farms spread out along Cobleskill Creek . It was part of the Schoharie Creek area which was a significant source of food for the Patriot war effort . Its principal defense was the small local militia under Captain Christian Brown . When attacks by the Iroquois were rumored to be coming in the spring of 1778 , the militia appealed for additional defenses . Continental Army Colonel Ichabod Alden sent a company of thirty to forty men from his 7th Massachusetts Regiment under Captain William Patrick to reinforce the militia . = = Battle = = On the morning of May 30 Brant laid a trap for Cobleskill 's defenders . He sent forward a small number of natives as a lure . Captain Patrick 's force and the local militia spotted them near the southern edge of the settlement . Despite Captain Brown 's warning that the Indians might be setting a trap , Patrick pressed forward as the natives withdrew , engaging them in a running battle . After about one mile ( 1.6 km ) Brant sprung his trap , and Patrick 's company was engulfed by Brant 's larger force . Both Patrick and his second in command were killed in the battle , as was about half of their force . Brown organized the remaining forces into a fighting retreat back into the settlement . Five men took refuge in the house of George Warner which the attackers set on fire , killing all five men . A total of 22 settlers were killed , eight were wounded , and five captured by Brant 's men , while Brant 's force suffered an estimated 25 casualties . = = Aftermath = = Brant and his men burned ten houses and associated outbuildings before withdrawing , killing any cattle they could not take . Brant took five [ seven ] prisoners , [ which the Indians prepared to burn at the stake as retribution for a previous group of captives effecting an escape from the Indians , killing several Indians to do so . This group of seven prisoners were made to gather wood for their own funeral pryer , and the fire was actually lit , before one of the captives , Lt. Maynard , a freemason , gave the mason signal of distress . Chief Brant noticed this , and stopped the execution . All of the seven captives were then made to march 40 days , first to Montreal , then to Quebec , obtaining only the sustenance they were able to gather while on the forced march . On the journey the Indians forced these seven captives to repeatedly \" run the gauntlet \" and forced them at times to keep their fingertips pushed into hot glowing pipe bowls for the Indians ' amusement . They were never given a choice of their future or lives by the Indians , or Chief Brant at any time . At Quebec these seven were ransomed by the Iroquois to the British authorities , and were kept at Quebec as prisoners of war until the treaty of 1783 . The account of Lt. Maynard is related in \" 1000 Famous Freemasons \" along with stories of an additional five masons , other revolutionary patriots , who were likewise saved by Brant . The groups capture and journey is chronicled in \" Forests and Clearings by BF Hubbard , Montreal , 1874 pp. 62 \u2013 63-64 . ] Brant continued to build his forces and raid frontier communities in the Mohawk valley . He considered following up the attack on Cobleskill with one on Cherry Valley , but because the militia was on high alert , he instead withdrew back to Iroquois territory . Cherry Valley was the scene of a massacre the following November by forces led in part by Brant . New York Governor George Clinton , who had been considering operations against Onaquaga , enlarged those plans after the raid on Cobleskill and Brant 's attack on German Flatts in September . In October 1778 Continental and militia forces destroyed Onaquaga and Unadilla , another Indian village that supported Brant and Butler . The settlers of Cobleskill who were rendered destitute by the action received \u00a3 200 in compensation for their troubles . Settlers from many area communities began withdrawing to larger , better fortified communities like Cherry Valley ( which began construction of a fort after the raid ) and Schenectady . This action and later ones by Brant and Butler contributed to the decision by the Continental Congress to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory . Commanded by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton , the 1779 expedition systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British , but did little to stop the frontier war .",
                "Battle of Bunker Hill = The Battle of Bunker Hill was fought on June 17 , 1775 , during the Siege of Boston in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War . The battle is named after Bunker Hill in Charlestown , Massachusetts , which was peripherally involved in the battle , and was the original objective of both the colonial and British troops , though the majority of combat took place on the adjacent Breed 's Hill . On June 13 , 1775 , the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British were planning to send troops out from the city to fortify the unoccupied hills surrounding the city , giving them control of Boston Harbor . In response , 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed 's Hill . During the night the colonists constructed a strong redoubt on Breed 's Hill , as well as smaller fortified lines across the Charlestown Peninsula . By daybreak of June 17 the British became aware of the presence of colonial forces on the Peninsula , and mounted an attack against them that day . After two assaults on the colonial positions were repulsed with significant British casualties , the third and final attack carried the redoubt after the defenders ran out of ammunition . The colonists retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill , leaving the British in control of the Peninsula . Though the battle was a tactical victory for the British , it proved to be a sobering experience for them , involving many more casualties than the Americans had incurred , including a large number of officers . The battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle . Subsequently the battle discouraged the British from any further frontal attacks against well defended front lines . Though American casualties were comparatively much less , their losses included General Joseph Warren and Major Andrew McClary , the final casualty of the battle . The battle led the British to adopt a more cautious planning and maneuver execution in future engagements , which was evident in the subsequent New York and New Jersey campaign , and arguably helped , rather than hindered , the American forces . Their new approach to battle was actually giving the Americans greater opportunity to retreat if defeat was imminent . The costly engagement also convinced the British of the need to hire substantial numbers of foreign mercenaries to bolster their strength in the face of the new and formidable Continental Army . = = Geography = = Boston , situated on a peninsula , was largely protected from close approach by the expanses of water surrounding it , which were dominated by British warships . In the aftermath of the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 , the colonial militia , a force of about 15,000 men had surrounded the town , and effectively besieged it . Under the command of Artemas Ward , they controlled the only land access to Boston itself ( the Roxbury Neck ) , but , lacking a navy , were unable to even contest British domination of the waters of the harbor . The British troops , a force of about 6,000 under the command of General Thomas Gage , occupied the city , and were able to be resupplied and reinforced by sea . In theory , they were thus able to remain in Boston indefinitely . However , the land across the water from Boston contained a number of hills , which could be used to advantage . If the militia could obtain enough artillery pieces , these could be placed on the hills and used to bombard the city until the occupying army evacuated it or surrendered . It was with this in mind that the Knox Expedition , led by Henry Knox , later transported cannon from Fort Ticonderoga to the Boston area . The Charlestown Peninsula , lying to the north of Boston , started from a short , narrow isthmus ( known as the Charlestown Neck ) at its northwest , extending about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) southeastward into Boston Harbor . Bunker Hill , with an elevation of 110 feet ( 34 m ) , lay at the northern end of the peninsula . Breed 's Hill , at a height of 62 feet ( 19 m ) , was more southerly and nearer to Boston . The town of Charlestown occupied flats at the southern end of the peninsula . At its closest approach , less than 1,000 feet ( 305 m ) separated the Charlestown Peninsula from the Boston Peninsula , where Copp 's Hill was at about the same height as Breed 's Hill . While the British retreat from Concord had ended in Charlestown , General Gage , rather than immediately fortifying the hills on the peninsula , had withdrawn those troops to Boston the day after that battle , turning the entire Charlestown Peninsula into a no man 's land . = = British planning = = Throughout May , in response to orders from Gage requesting support , the British received reinforcements , until they reached a strength of about 6,000 men . On May 25 , three generals arrived on HMS Cerberus : William Howe , John Burgoyne , and Henry Clinton . Gage began planning with them to break out of the city , finalizing a plan on June 12 . This plan began with the taking of the Dorchester Neck , fortifying the Dorchester Heights , and then marching on the colonial forces stationed in Roxbury . Once the southern flank had been secured , the Charlestown heights would be taken , and the forces in Cambridge driven away . The attack was set for June 18 . On June 13 , the Massachusetts Provincial Congress was notified , by express messenger from the Committee of Safety in Exeter , New Hampshire , that a New Hampshire gentleman \" of undoubted veracity \" had , while visiting Boston , overheard the British commanders making plans to capture Dorchester and Charlestown . On June 15 , the Massachusetts Committee of Safety decided that additional defenses needed to be erected . General Ward directed General Israel Putnam to set up defenses on the Charlestown Peninsula , specifically on Bunker Hill . = = Prelude to battle = = = = = Fortification of Breed 's Hill = = = On the night of June 16 , colonial Colonel William Prescott led about 1,200 men onto the peninsula in order to set up positions from which artillery fire could be directed into Boston . This force was made up of men from the regiments of Prescott , Putnam ( the unit was commanded by Thomas Knowlton ) , James Frye , and Ebenezer Bridge . At first , Putnam , Prescott , and their engineer , Captain Richard Gridley , disagreed as to where they should locate their defense . Some work was performed on Bunker Hill , but Breed 's Hill was closer to Boston and viewed as being more defensible . Arguably against orders , they decided to build their primary redoubt there . Prescott and his men , using Gridley 's outline , began digging a square fortification about 130 feet ( 40 m ) on a side with ditches and earthen walls . The walls of the redoubt were about 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) high , with a wooden platform inside on which men could stand and fire over the walls . The works on Breed 's Hill did not go unnoticed by the British . General Clinton , out on reconnaissance that night , was aware of them , and tried to convince Gage and Howe that they needed to prepare to attack the position at daylight . British sentries were also aware of the activity , but most apparently did not think it cause for alarm . Then , in the early predawn , around 4 a.m. , a sentry on board HMS Lively spotted the new fortification , and notified her captain . Lively opened fire , temporarily halting the colonists ' work . Aboard his flagship HMS Somerset , Admiral Samuel Graves awoke , irritated by the gunfire that he had not ordered . He stopped it , only to have General Gage countermand his decision when he became fully aware of the situation in the morning . He ordered all 128 guns in the harbor , as well as batteries atop Copp 's Hill in Boston , to fire on the colonial position , which had relatively little effect . The rising sun also alerted Prescott to a significant problem with the location of the redoubt \u2013 it could easily be flanked on either side . He promptly ordered his men to begin constructing a breastwork running down the hill to the east , deciding he did not have the manpower to also build additional defenses to the west of the redoubt . = = = British preparations = = = When the British generals met to discuss their options , General Clinton , who had urged an attack as early as possible , preferred an attack beginning from the Charlestown Neck that would cut off the colonists ' retreat , reducing the process of capturing the new redoubt to one of starving out its occupants . However , he was outvoted by the other three generals . Howe , who was the senior officer present and would lead the assault , was of the opinion that the hill was \" open and easy of ascent and in short would be easily carried . \" General Burgoyne concurred , arguing that the \" untrained rabble \" would be no match for their \" trained troops \" . Orders were then issued to prepare the expedition . When General Gage surveyed the works from Boston with his staff , Loyalist Abijah Willard recognized his brother-in-law Colonel Prescott . \" Will he fight ? \" asked Gage . \" [ A ] s to his men , I cannot answer for them ; \" replied Willard , \" but Colonel Prescott will fight you to the gates of hell . \" Prescott lived up to Willard 's word , but his men were not so resolute . When the colonists suffered their first casualty , Asa Pollard of Billerica , a young private killed by cannon fire , Prescott gave orders to bury the man quickly and quietly , but a large group of men gave him a solemn funeral instead , with several deserting shortly thereafter . It took six hours for the British to organize an infantry force and to gather up and inspect the men on parade . General Howe was to lead the major assault , drive around the colonial left flank , and take them from the rear . Brigadier General Robert Pigot on the British left flank would lead the direct assault on the redoubt , and Major John Pitcairn led the flank or reserve force . It took several trips in longboats to transport Howe 's initial forces ( consisting of about 1,500 men ) to the eastern corner of the peninsula , known as Moulton 's Point . By 2 p.m. , Howe 's chosen force had landed . However , while crossing the river , Howe noted the large number of colonial troops on top of Bunker Hill . Believing these to be reinforcements , he immediately sent a message to Gage , requesting additional troops . He then ordered some of the light infantry to take a forward position along the eastern side of the peninsula , alerting the colonists to his intended course of action . The troops then sat down to eat while they waited for the reinforcements . = = = Colonists reinforce their positions = = = Prescott , seeing the British preparations , called for reinforcements . Among the reinforcements were Joseph Warren , the popular young leader of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety , and Seth Pomeroy , an aging Massachusetts militia leader . Both of these men held commissions of rank , but chose to serve as infantry . Prescott ordered the Connecticut men under Captain Knowlton to defend the left flank , where they used a crude dirt wall as a breastwork , and topped it with fence rails and hay . They also constructed three small v-shaped trenches between this dirt wall and Prescott 's breastwork . Troops that arrived to reinforce this flank position included about 200 men from the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments , under Colonels John Stark and James Reed . Stark 's men , who did not arrive until after Howe landed his forces ( and thus filled a gap in the defense that Howe could have taken advantage of , had he pressed his attack sooner ) , took positions along the breastwork on the northern end of the colonial position . When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River to the north , they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the water 's edge . Colonel Stark placed a stake about 100 feet ( 30 m ) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it . Just prior to the action , further reinforcements arrived , including portions of Massachusetts regiments of Colonels Brewer , Nixon , Woodbridge , Little , and Major Moore , as well as Callender 's company of artillery . Behind the colonial lines , confusion reigned . Many units sent toward the action stopped before crossing the Charlestown Neck from Cambridge , which was under constant fire from gun batteries to the south . Others reached Bunker Hill , but then , uncertain about where to go from there , milled around . One commentator wrote of the scene that \" it appears to me there never was more confusion and less command . \" While General Putnam was on the scene attempting to direct affairs , unit commanders often misunderstood or disobeyed orders . = = British assault = = By 3 p.m. , the British reinforcements , which included the 47th Foot and the 1st Marines , had arrived , and the British were ready to march . Brigadier General Pigot 's force , gathering just south of Charlestown village , were taking casualties from sniper fire , and Howe asked Admiral Graves for assistance in clearing out the snipers . Graves , who had planned for such a possibility , ordered incendiary shot fired into the village , and then sent a landing party to set fire to the town . The smoke billowing from Charlestown lent an almost surreal backdrop to the fighting , as the winds were such that the smoke was kept from the field of battle . Pigot , commanding the 5th , 38th , 43rd , 47th , and 52nd regiments , as well as Major Pitcairn 's Marines , were to feint an assault on the redoubt . However , they continued to be harried by snipers in Charlestown , and Pigot , when he saw what happened to Howe 's advance , ordered a retreat . General Howe led the light infantry companies and grenadiers in the assault on the American left flank , expecting an easy effort against Stark 's recently arrived troops . His light infantry were set along the narrow beach , in column , in order to turn the far left flank of the colonial position . The grenadiers were deployed in the middle . They lined up four deep and several hundred across . As the regulars closed , John Simpson , a New Hampshire man , prematurely fired , drawing an ineffective volley of return fire from the regulars . When the regulars finally closed within range , both sides opened fire . The colonists inflicted heavy casualties on the regulars , using the fence to steady and aim their muskets , and benefit from a modicum of cover . With this devastating barrage of musket fire , the regulars retreated in disarray , and the militia held their ground . The regulars reformed on the field and marched out again . This time , Pigot was not to feint ; he was to assault the redoubt , possibly without the assistance of Howe 's force . Howe , instead of marching against Stark 's position along the beach , marched instead against Knowlton 's position along the rail fence . The outcome of the second attack was much the same as the first . One British observer wrote , \" Most of our Grenadiers and Light-infantry , the moment of presenting themselves lost three-fourths , and many nine-tenths , of their men . Some had only eight or nine men a company left ... \" Pigot did not fare any better in his attack on the redoubt , and again ordered a retreat . Meanwhile , in the rear of the colonial forces , confusion continued to reign . General Putnam tried , with only limited success , to send additional troops from Bunker Hill to Breed 's Hill to support the men in the redoubt and along the defensive lines . The British rear was also in some disarray . Wounded soldiers that were mobile had made their way to the landing areas , and were being ferried back to Boston , and the wounded lying on the field of battle were the source of moans and cries of pain . General Howe , deciding that he would try again , sent word to General Clinton in Boston for additional troops . Clinton , who had watched the first two attacks , sent about 400 men from the 2nd Marines and the 63rd Foot , and then followed himself to help rally the troops . In addition to the new reserves , he also convinced about 200 of the wounded to form up for the third attack . During the interval between the second and third assaults , General Putnam continued trying to direct troops toward the action . Some companies , and leaderless groups of men , moved toward the action ; others retreated . John Chester , a Connecticut captain , seeing an entire company in retreat , ordered his company to aim muskets at that company to halt its retreat ; they turned about and headed back to the battlefield . The third assault , concentrated on the redoubt ( with only a feint on the colonists ' flank ) , was successful , although the colonists again poured musket fire into the British ranks , and it cost the life of Major Pitcairn . The defenders had run out of ammunition , reducing the battle to close combat . The British had the advantage once they entered the redoubt , as their troops were equipped with bayonets on their muskets while most of the colonists were not . Colonel Prescott , one of the last colonists to leave the redoubt , parried bayonet thrusts with his normally ceremonial sabre . It is during the retreat from the redoubt that Joseph Warren was killed . The retreat of much of the colonial forces from the peninsula was made possible in part by the controlled retreat of the forces along the rail fence , led by John Stark and Thomas Knowlton , which prevented the encirclement of the hill . Their disciplined retreat , described by Burgoyne as \" no flight ; it was even covered with bravery and military skill \" , was so effective that most of the wounded were saved ; most of the prisoners taken by the British were mortally wounded . General Putnam attempted to reform the troops on Bunker Hill ; however the flight of the colonial forces was so rapid that artillery pieces and entrenching tools had to be abandoned . The colonists suffered most of their casualties during the retreat on Bunker Hill . By 5 p.m. , the colonists had retreated over the Charlestown Neck to fortified positions in Cambridge , and the British were in control of the peninsula . = = Aftermath = = The British had taken the ground but at a great loss ; they had suffered 1,054 casualties ( 226 dead and 828 wounded ) , with a disproportionate number of these officers . The casualty count was the highest suffered by the British in any single encounter during the entire war . General Clinton , echoing Pyrrhus of Epirus , remarked in his diary that \" A few more such victories would have shortly put an end to British dominion in America . \" British dead and wounded included 100 commissioned officers , a significant portion of the British officer corps in North America . Much of General Howe 's field staff was among the casualties . Major Pitcairn had been killed , and Lieutenant Colonel James Abercrombie fatally wounded . General Gage , in his report after the battle , reported the following officer casualties ( listing lieutenants and above by name ) : 1 lieutenant colonel killed 2 majors killed , 3 wounded 7 captains killed , 27 wounded 9 lieutenants killed , 32 wounded 15 sergeants killed , 42 wounded 1 drummer killed , 12 wounded The colonial losses were about 450 , of whom 140 were killed . Most of the colonial losses came during the withdrawal . Major Andrew McClary was technically the highest ranking colonial officer to die in the battle ; he was hit by cannon fire on Charlestown Neck , the last person to be killed in the battle . He was later commemorated by the dedication of Fort McClary in Kittery , Maine . A serious loss to the Patriot cause , however , was the death of Dr. Joseph Warren . He was the President of Massachusetts ' Provincial Congress , and he had been appointed a Major General on June 14 . His commission had not yet taken effect when he served as a volunteer private three days later at Bunker Hill . Only thirty men were captured by the British , most of them with grievous wounds ; twenty died while held prisoner . The colonials also lost numerous shovels and other entrenching tools , as well as five out of the six cannon they had brought to the peninsula . = = Political consequences = = When news of the battle spread through the colonies , it was reported as a colonial loss , as the ground had been taken by the enemy , and significant casualties were incurred . George Washington , who was on his way to Boston as the new commander of the Continental Army , received news of the battle while in New York City . The report , which included casualty figures that were somewhat inaccurate , gave Washington hope that his army might prevail in the conflict . The Massachusetts Committee of Safety , seeking to repeat the sort of propaganda victory it won following the battles at Lexington and Concord , commissioned a report of the battle to send to England . Their report , however , did not reach England before Gage 's official account arrived on July 20 . His report unsurprisingly caused friction and argument between the Tories and the Whigs , but the casualty counts alarmed the military establishment , and forced many to rethink their views of colonial military capability . King George 's attitude toward the colonies hardened , and the news may have contributed to his rejection of the Continental Congress ' Olive Branch Petition , the last substantive political attempt at reconciliation . Sir James Adolphus Oughton , part of the Tory majority , wrote to Lord Dartmouth of the colonies , \" the sooner they are made to Taste Distress the sooner will [ Crown control over them ] be produced , and the Effusion of Blood be put a stop to . \" About a month after receiving Gage 's report the Proclamation of Rebellion would be issued in response ; this hardening of the British position would also lead to a hardening of previously weak support for the rebellion , especially in the southern colonies , in favor of independence . Gage 's report had a more direct effect on his own career . His dismissal from office was decided just three days after his report was received , although General Howe did not replace him until October 1775 . Gage wrote another report to the British Cabinet , in which he repeated earlier warnings that \" a large army must at length be employed to reduce these people \" , that would require \" the hiring of foreign troops . \" = = Analysis = = Much has been written in the wake of this battle over how it was conducted . Both sides made strategic and tactical missteps which could have altered the outcome of the battle . While hindsight often gives a biased view , some things seem to be apparent after the battle that might reasonably have been within the reach of the command of the day . Years after the battle General Dearborn published an account of the battle in Port Folio magazine , accusing General Putnam of inaction , cowardly leadership and failing to supply reinforcements during the battle , which subsequently sparked a long lasting and major controversy among veterans of the war , various friends , family members and historians . = = = Disposition of Colonial forces = = = The colonial forces , while nominally under the overall command of General Ward , with General Putnam and Colonel Prescott leading in the field , often acted quite independently . This was evident in the opening stages of the battle , when a tactical decision was made that had strategic implications . After deliberating with General Putnam and Colonel Gridley , Colonel Prescott and his staff , apparently in contravention of orders , decided to fortify Breed 's Hill rather than Bunker Hill . The fortification of Breed 's Hill was more provocative ; it would have put offensive artillery closer to Boston . It also exposed the forces there to the possibility of being trapped , as they probably could not properly defend against attempts by the British to land troops and take control of Charlestown Neck . If the British had taken that step , they might have had a victory with many fewer casualties . While the front lines of the colonial forces were generally well managed , the scene behind them , especially once the action began , was significantly disorganized , due at least in part to a poor chain of command . Only some of the militias operated directly under Ward 's and Putnam 's authority , and some commanders also disobeyed orders , staying at Bunker Hill rather than joining in the defense on the third British assault . Several officers were subjected to court martial and cashiered . Colonel Prescott was of the opinion that the third assault would have been repulsed , had his forces in the redoubt been reinforced with either more men , or more supplies of ammunition and powder . = = = Disposition of British forces = = = The British leadership , for its part , acted slowly once the works on Breed 's Hill were spotted . It was 2 p.m. when the troops were ready for the assault , roughly ten hours after the Lively first opened fire . This leisurely pace gave the colonial forces time to reinforce the flanking positions that had been poorly defended . Gage and Howe decided that a frontal assault on the works would be a simple matter , when an encircling move ( gaining control of Charlestown Neck ) , would have given them a more resounding victory . ( This move would not have been without risks of its own , as the colonists could have made holding the Neck expensive with fire from the high ground in Cambridge . ) But the British leadership was excessively optimistic , believing that \" two regiments were sufficient to beat the strength of the province \" . Once in the field , Howe , rather than focusing on the redoubt , opted ( twice ) to dilute the force attacking the redoubt with a flanking maneuver against the colonial left . It was only with the third attack , when the flank attack was merely a feint , and the main force ( now also reinforced with additional reserves ) squarely targeted the redoubt , that the attack succeeded . Following the taking of the peninsula , the British arguably had a tactical advantage that they could have used to press into Cambridge . General Clinton proposed this to Howe ; having just led three assaults with grievous casualties , he declined the idea . The colonial military leaders eventually recognized Howe as a tentative decision-maker , to his detriment ; in the aftermath of the Battle of Long Island ( 1776 ) , he again had tactical advantages that might have delivered Washington 's army into his hands , but again refused to act . Historian John Ferling maintains that had General Gage used the Royal Navy to secure the narrow neck to the Charleston peninsula , cutting the Americans off from the mainland , he could have achieved a far less costly victory , but he was motivated by revenge over patriot resistance at the Battles of Lexington and Concord and relatively heavy British losses , and also felt that the colonial militia were completely untrained and could be overtaken with little effort , opting for a frontal assault . = = \" The whites of their eyes \" = = The famous order \" Don 't fire until you see the whites of their eyes \" was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill . It is uncertain as to who said it there , since various histories , including eyewitness accounts , attribute it to Putnam , Stark , Prescott , or Gridley , and it may have been said first by one , and repeated by the others . It was also not an original statement . The idea dates originally to the general-king Gustavus Adolphus ( 1594 \u2013 1632 ) who gave standing orders to his musketeers : \" never to give fire , till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy 's eye \" . Gustavus Adolphus 's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated . It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham , when his troops defeated Montcalm 's army on September 13 , 1759 . The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27 , 1743 , where Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment , the Royal Scots Fusiliers , not to fire until they could \" see the white of their e 'en . \" The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745 , and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great , and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with . Whether or not it was actually said in this battle , it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect , especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited . = = Notable participants = = A significant number of notable people fought in this battle . Henry Dearborn and William Eustis , for example , went on to distinguished military and political careers ; both served in Congress , the Cabinet , and in diplomatic posts . Others , like John Brooks , Henry Burbeck , Christian Febiger , Thomas Knowlton , and John Stark , became well known for later actions in the war . Stark became known as the \" Hero of Bennington \" for his role in the 1777 Battle of Bennington . Free African-Americans also fought in the battle ; notable examples include Barzillai Lew , Salem Poor , and Peter Salem . Another notable participant was Daniel Shays , who later became famous for his army of protest in Shays ' Rebellion . Israel Potter was immortalized in Israel Potter : His Fifty Years of Exile , a novel by Herman Melville . Colonel John Paterson commanded the Massachusetts First Militia , served in Shays ' Rebellion , and became a congressman from New York . Lt. Col. Seth Read , who served under John Paterson at Bunker Hill , went on to settle Geneva , New York and Erie , Pennsylvania , and was said to have been instrumental in the phrase E pluribus unum being added to U.S. coins . George Claghorn of the Massachusetts militia was shot in the knee at Bunker Hill and went on after the war to become the master builder of the USS Constitution , a.k.a. \" Old Ironsides \" , which is the oldest naval vessel in the world that is still commissioned and afloat . = = Commemorations = = John Trumbull 's painting , The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill ( displayed in lede ) , was created as an allegorical depiction of the battle and Warren 's death , not as an actual pictorial recording of the event . The painting shows a number of participants in the battle including a British officer , John Small , among those who stormed the redoubt , yet came to be the one holding the mortally wounded Warren and preventing a fellow redcoat from bayoneting him . He was friends of Putnam and Trumbull . Other central figures include Andrew McClary who was the last man to fall in the battle . The Bunker Hill Monument is an obelisk that stands 221 feet ( 67 m ) high on Breed 's Hill . On June 17 , 1825 , the fiftieth anniversary of the battle , the cornerstone of the monument was laid by the Marquis de Lafayette and an address delivered by Daniel Webster . ( When Lafayette died , he was buried next to his wife at the Cimeti\u00e8re de Picpus under soil from Bunker Hill , which his son Georges sprinkled over him . ) The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge was specifically designed to evoke this monument . There is also a statue of William Prescott showing him calming his men down . The National Park Service operates a museum dedicated to the battle near the monument , which is part of the Boston National Historical Park . A cyclorama of the battle was added in 2007 when the museum was renovated . In nearby Cambridge , a small granite monument just north of Harvard Yard bears this inscription : \" Here assembled on the night of June 16 , 1775 , 1200 Continental troops under command of Colonel Prescott . After prayer by President Langdon , they marched to Bunker Hill . \" See footnote for picture . ( Samuel Langdon , a Congregational minister , was Harvard 's 11th president . ) Another small monument nearby marks the location of the Committee of Safety , which had become the Patriots ' provisional government as Tories left Cambridge . These monuments are on the lawn to the west of Harvard 's Littaeur Center , which is itself the west of Harvard 's huge Science Center . See footnote for map . Bunker Hill Day , observed every June 17 , is a legal holiday in Suffolk County , Massachusetts ( which includes the city of Boston ) , as well as Somerville in Middlesex County . Prospect Hill , site of colonial fortifications overlooking the Charlestown Neck , is now located in Somerville , which was previously part of Charlestown . State institutions in Massachusetts ( such as public institutions of higher education ) located in Boston also celebrate the holiday . However , the state 's FY2011 budget requires that all state and municipal offices in Suffolk County be open on Bunker Hill Day and Evacuation Day . On June 16 and 17 , 1875 , the centennial of the battle was celebrated with a military parade and a reception featuring notable speakers , among them General William Tecumseh Sherman and Vice President Henry Wilson . It was attended by dignitaries from across the country . Celebratory events also marked the sesquicentennial ( 150th anniversary ) in 1925 and the bicentennial in 1975 . Over the years the Battle of Bunker Hill has been commemorated on four U.S. Postage stamps .",
                "New York and New Jersey campaign = The New York and New Jersey campaign was a series of battles for control of New York City and the state of New Jersey in the American Revolutionary War between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 . Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York City , but overextended his reach into New Jersey , and ended the active campaign season in January 1777 with only a few outposts near the city . The British held New York harbor for the rest of the war , using it as a base for expeditions against other targets . First landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3 , 1776 , Howe assembled an army composed of elements that had been withdrawn from Boston in March following their failure to hold that city , combined with additional British troops , as well as Hessian troops rented from several German principalities . Washington had New England soldiers as well as regiments from states as far south as Virginia . Landing on Long Island in August , Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war , but the Continental Army was able to retreat to Manhattan under cover of darkness and fog . Washington suffered a series of defeats in Manhattan , with the exception of a victory at Harlem Heights , but was nevertheless chased north to White Plains , New York . At that point Howe returned to Manhattan to capture forces Washington had left in the north of that island . Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River into New Jersey , and retreated all the way across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania , shrinking due to ending enlistment periods , desertions , and poor morale . Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December , establishing a chain of outposts from New York to Burlington , New Jersey . Washington , in a tremendous boost to American morale , launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison after crossing the icy Delaware River , prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York , while Washington established his winter camp at Morristown . During the remaining winter months , both sides skirmished frequently as the British sought forage and provisions . Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783 , using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America . In 1777 , General Howe launched a campaign to capture Philadelphia , leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area , while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley from Quebec that failed at Saratoga . Northern New Jersey was the scene of skirmishing between the opposing forces for the rest of the war . = = Background = = When the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775 , British troops were under siege in Boston . They defeated Patriot forces in the Battle of Bunker Hill , suffering very high casualties . When news of this expensive British victory reached London , General William Howe and Lord George Germain , the British official responsible , determined that a \" decisive action \" should be taken against New York City using forces recruited from throughout the British Empire as well as troops hired from small German states . General George Washington , recently named by the Second Continental Congress as the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army , echoed the sentiments of others that New York was \" a post of infinite importance \" , and began the task of organizing military companies in the New York area when he stopped there on his way to take command of the siege of Boston . In January 1776 Washington ordered Charles Lee to raise troops and take command of New York 's defenses . Lee had made some progress on the city 's defenses when word arrived in late March 1776 that the British army had left Boston after Washington threatened them from heights south of the city . Concerned that General Howe was sailing directly to New York , Washington hurried regiments from Boston , including General Israel Putnam , who commanded the troops until Washington himself arrived in mid-April . At the end of April , Washington dispatched General John Sullivan with six regiments to the north to bolster the faltering Quebec campaign . General Howe , rather than moving against New York , withdrew his army to Halifax , Nova Scotia , and regrouped while transports full of British troops , shipped from bases around Europe and intended for New York , began gathering at Halifax . In June he set sail for New York with the 9,000 men assembled there , before all of the transports arrived . German troops , primarily from Hesse-Kassel , as well as British troops from Henry Clinton 's ultimately unsuccessful expedition to the Carolinas , were to meet with Howe 's fleet when it reached New York . General Howe 's brother , Admiral Lord Howe , arrived at Halifax with further transports after the general sailed , and immediately followed . When General Howe arrived in the outer harbor of New York , the ships began sailing up the undefended Narrows between Staten Island and Long island on July 2 , and started landing troops on the undefended shores of Staten Island that day . Washington learned from prisoners taken that Howe had landed 10,000 men , but was awaiting the arrival of another 15,000 . General Washington , with a smaller army of about 19,000 effective troops , lacked significant intelligence on the British force and plans , and was uncertain exactly where in the New York area the Howes intended to strike . He consequently split the Continental Army between fortified positions on Long Island , Manhattan and other mainland locations , and also established a \" Flying Camp \" in northern New Jersey . This was intended as a reserve force that could support operations anywhere along the Jersey shore of the Hudson . = = Capture of New York City = = The Howe brothers had been granted authority as peace commissioners by Parliament , with limited powers to pursue a peaceful resolution to the conflict . King George III was not optimistic about the possibility of a peace , \" yet I think it right to be attempted , whilst every act of vigour is unremittingly carried on \" . Their powers were limited to granting of \" general and special pardons \" and to \" confer with any of his Majesty 's subjects \" . On July 14 , pursuant to these powers , Admiral Howe sent a messenger with a letter addressed to \" George Washington , Esq . \" across the harbor . Washington 's adjutant , Joseph Reed , politely informed the messenger that no person with that title was in their army . Admiral Howe 's aide wrote that \" the Punctilio of an Address \" should not have prevented the letter 's delivery , and Howe was said to be visibly annoyed by the rejection . A second request , addressed to \" George Washington , Esq . , etc . \" was similarly rejected , although the messenger was told that Washington would receive one of Howe 's adjutants . In that fruitless meeting , held July 20 , Washington pointed out that the limited powers the Howe brothers had been given were not of much use , as the rebels had done no wrong requiring an amnesty . In late August , the British transported about 22,000 men ( including 9,000 Hessians ) from Staten Island to Long Island . In the Battle of Long Island on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to their Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe then began to lay siege to the works , but Washington skillfully managed a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear across the East River to Manhattan Island . Howe then paused to consolidate his position and consider his next move . During the battle , the British had captured General John Sullivan . Admiral Howe convinced him to deliver a message to Congress in Philadelphia , and released him on parole . Washington also gave his permission , and on September 2 Sullivan told the Congress that the Howes wanted to negotiate , and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held . This created a diplomatic problem for Congress , which did not want to be seen as aggressive , which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of the appeal would appear . Consequently , Congress agreed to send a committee to meet with the Howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit . On September 11 , the Howe brothers met with John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , and Edward Rutledge in the Staten Island Peace Conference . It had exactly the outcome the Americans expected . During this time , Washington , who had previously been ordered by Congress to hold New York City , was concerned that he might have escaped one trap for another , since the army was still vulnerable to being surrounded on Manhattan . To keep his escape routes open to the north , he placed 5,000 troops in the city ( which then only occupied the lower portion of Manhattan ) , and took the rest of the army to Harlem Heights . In the first recorded use of a submarine in warfare , he also attempted a novel attack on the Royal Navy , launching the Turtle in a failed attempt to sink the HMS Eagle , Admiral Howe 's flagship . On September 15 , General Howe landed about 12,000 men on lower Manhattan , quickly taking control of New York City . The Americans withdrew to Harlem , where they skirmished the next day , but held their ground . Rather than attempting to dislodge Washington from his strong position a second time , Howe again opted for a flanking maneuver . Landing troops with some opposition in October in Westchester County , he sought once again to encircle Washington . To defend against this move , Washington withdrew most of his army to White Plains , where after a short battle on October 28 he retreated further north . This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan , so Howe returned to Manhattan and captured Fort Washington in mid November , taking almost 3,000 prisoners . Four days later , November 20 , Fort Lee , across the Hudson River from Fort Washington , was also taken . Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey , but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance . General Howe , after consolidating British positions around New York harbor , detached 6,000 men under the command of two of his more difficult subordinates , Henry Clinton , and Hugh , Earl Percy to take Newport , Rhode Island ( which they did without opposition on December 8 ) , while he sent General Lord Cornwallis to chase Washington 's army through New Jersey . The Americans withdrew across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania in early December . = = Reactions = = The outlook of the Continental Army \u2014 and thus the revolution itself \u2014 was bleak . \" These are the times that try men 's souls \" , wrote Thomas Paine in The American Crisis . Washington 's army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men fit for duty and would be significantly reduced after enlistments expired at the end of the year . Spirits were low , popular support was wavering , and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia , fearing a British attack . Washington ordered some of the troops that returned from the failed invasion of Quebec to join him , and also ordered General Lee 's troops , which he had left north of New York City , to join him . Lee , whose relationship with Washington was at times difficult , made excuses and only traveled as far as Morristown , New Jersey . When Lee strayed too far from his army on December 12 , his exposed position was betrayed by Loyalists , and a British company led by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton surrounded the inn where he was staying and took him prisoner . Lee 's command was taken over by John Sullivan , who finished marching the army to Washington 's camp across the river from Trenton . The capture of Lee presented the Howes with a problematic prisoner . As with a number of other Continental Army leaders , he had previously served in the British Army . Because of this the Howes at first treated him as a deserter , with threats of military punishment . However , Washington intervened , tying the treatment of Lee to the treatment of prisoners he held . Lee was ultimately treated well , and apparently offered the British commanders advice on how to win the war . Because the Americans did not have a prisoner of comparable rank , Lee remained a prisoner in New York until 1778 , when was exchanged for Richard Prescott . The failure of the Continental Army to hold New York also brought about a rise in Loyalist activity , as the city became a haven for refugee supporters of the Crown from elsewhere across the country . The British actively recruited in New York and New Jersey to build regiments of provincial militia , with some success . Loyalists in these areas may have been motivated by seeing elements of the rebel army head home after their enlistments ended . One New York Patriot militia leader wrote that thirty of his men , rather than reenlisting with him , had instead signed up with the enemy . On November 30 Admiral Howe offered amnesty to anyone that had taken up arms against the Crown , provided they swore an oath to it . Washington responded with his own proclamation suggesting that those who did not renounce such oaths should immediately go behind British lines . As a result , New Jersey became a civil battlefield , with militia activity as well as spying and counterspying continuing for the rest of the war . News of the capture of New York was favorably received in London , and General Howe was awarded the Order of the Bath for his work . Combined with news of the recovery of Quebec , circumstances suggested to British leaders that the war could be ended with one more year 's campaigning . News of Admiral Howe 's amnesty proclamation was met with some surprise , as its terms were more lenient than the hardliners in the government expected . Politicians opposed to the war pointed out that the proclamation failed to mention the primacy of the Parliament . Furthermore , the Howes were criticized for failing to keep Parliament informed of the various peace efforts they embarked on . = = Howe 's strategy = = With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season , the British established a chain of outposts stretching from Perth Amboy to Bordentown and entered winter quarters . They controlled much of New York and New Jersey and were in a good position to resume operations in the spring , with the rebel capital of Philadelphia in striking distance . Howe detached General Clinton with 6,000 men to occupy Newport , Rhode Island as a base for future operations against Boston and Connecticut ( Clinton occupied Newport in early December without opposition . ) Howe then sketched a campaign for the following year in a letter to Lord Germain : 10,000 men at Newport , 10,000 for an expedition to Albany ( to meet an army descending from Quebec ) , 8,000 to cross New Jersey and threaten Philadelphia , and 5,000 to defend New York . If additional foreign forces were available , operations could also be considered against the southern states . = = Washington 's counterstrike = = While worrying over how to hold his army together , Washington organized attacks on the relatively exposed British outposts , which were as a result continually on edge due to ongoing militia and army raids . German commanders Carl von Donop and Johann Rall , whose brigades were at the end of the chain of outposts , were frequent targets of these raids , but their repeated warnings and requests for support from General James Grant were dismissed . Beginning in mid-December , Washington planned a two-pronged attack on Rall 's outpost in Trenton , with a third diversionary attack on Donop 's outpost in Bordentown . The plan was aided by the fortuitous presence of a militia company that drew Donop 's entire 2,000-man force away from Bordentown to the south that resulted in a skirmish at Mount Holly on December 23 . The consequence of this action was that Donop was not in a position to assist Rall when Washington 's attack on Trenton took place . On the night of December 25 \u2013 26 , Washington and 2,400 men stealthily crossed the Delaware and surprised Rall 's outpost the following morning , killing or capturing nearly 1,000 Hessians . This action not only significantly boosted the army 's morale ; it also brought Cornwallis out of New York . He reassembled an army of more than 6,000 men , and marched most of them against a position Washington had taken south of Trenton . Leaving a garrison of 1,200 at Princeton , Cornwallis then attacked Washington 's position on January 2 , 1777 , and was three times repulsed before darkness set in . During the night Washington once again stealthily moved his army , going around that of Cornwallis with the intention of attacking the Princeton garrison . Hugh Mercer , leading the American advance guard , encountered British soldiers from Princeton under the command of Charles Mawhood . The British troops engaged Mercer and in the ensuing battle , Mercer was mortally wounded . Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader , which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton , with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton . The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle , and American morale rose with the victory . The defeats convinced General Howe to withdraw most of his army from New Jersey , only leaving outposts at New Brunswick and Perth Amboy . Washington entered winter quarters at Morristown , having retaken most of the state from the British . However , provisions for both armies were limited , and commanders on both sides sent out parties to forage for food and other supplies . For the next few months , they engaged in a forage war , in which each targeted the foraging parties of the other . This led to numerous skirmishes and minor confrontations including the Battle of Millstone . The British also sniped with each other over the subject of provisions . Lord Percy resigned his command after a series of disagreements with Howe came to a head over the ability of the Newport station to provide forage to the New York and New Jersey forces . = = Aftermath = = The British gained control of New York harbor and the surrounding agricultural areas , and held New York City and Long Island until the war ended in 1783 . The Americans suffered significant casualties and lost important supplies , but Washington managed to retain the core of his army and avoid a decisive confrontation that could have ended the war . With the bold strokes of Trenton and Princeton , he had regained initiative and boosted morale . The areas around New York City in New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut were an ongoing battleground for the rest of the war . The early reports that General Howe sent to his superiors in London concerning the battles at Trenton and Princeton attempted to minimize their significance , blaming Rall for Trenton , and trying to recast Princeton as a nearly successful defense . Not everyone was fooled by his accounts , in particular Lord Germain . In a letter to the Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister Germain wrote that \" the officer who commanded [ the forces at Trenton ] and to whom this misfortune is to be attributed has lost his life by his rashness . \" Heister in turn had to report the loss to his ruler , Frederick II , Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel , with the news that not only had an entire brigade been lost , but sixteen regimental colors and six cannon as well . The news reportedly enraged Frederick , who broadly suggested that Heister return home ( which he did , turning over command of the Hessian forces to Wilhelm von Knyphausen ) . Frederick also ordered extensive inquiries into the events of 1776 , that took place in New York from 1778 to 1782 . These inquiries created a unique archive of materials about the campaign . The news of Washington 's successes reached Paris at a critical time . Britain 's ambassador to France , Lord Stormont , was preparing complaints to France 's foreign minister , the Comte de Vergennes , concerning the semi-secret financial and logistical support France had been giving to the rebels . Stormont had learned that supplies bound for America were to be shipped under French flags , where they had previously sent under American colors . He wrote that the French court was extremely happy with the news , and that the French diplomatic position noticeably hardened : \" that M. de Vergennes is hostile in his heart and anxious for the success of the Rebels I have not a shadow of a doubt . \" = = Next steps = = The British planned two major operations for the 1777 campaign season . The first was an ambitious plan to gain control of the Hudson River valley , whose central thrust was a move along Lake Champlain by the army from Quebec under General John Burgoyne . Execution of this plan ultimately failed , ending with the surrender of Burgoyne 's army at Saratoga , New York , in October . The second operation was General Howe 's plan to take Philadelphia , which , after a difficult start , met with success in September . Washington 's strategy in 1777 continued to be a basically defensive one . He successfully fended off an attempt by Howe to draw him into a general engagement in northern New Jersey , but was unable to prevent Howe 's later success taking Philadelphia . He did send material help to General Horatio Gates , who was tasked with defending against Burgoyne 's movements . Major General Benedict Arnold and Daniel Morgan 's riflemen all played a notable role in the defeat of Burgoyne , following which France entered the war . = = Legacy = = In the urban environments of Manhattan , Brooklyn , and Trenton there are plaques and other memorials placed to commemorate the actions that took place in and around those locations . The Princeton Battlefield and Washington 's Crossing are National Historic Landmarks , with state parks also preserving all or part of the locations where events of this campaign occurred in those areas . Morristown National Historical Park preserves locations occupied by the Continental Army during the winter months at the end of the campaign .",
                "Battle of Iron Works Hill = The Battle of Iron Works Hill , also known as the Battle of Mount Holly , was a series of minor skirmishes that took place on December 22 and 23 , 1776 , during the American War of Independence . They took place in Mount Holly , New Jersey , between an American force mostly composed of colonial militia under Colonel Samuel Griffin and a force of 2,000 Hessians and British regulars under Carl von Donop . While the American force of 600 was eventually forced from their positions by the larger Hessian force , the action prevented von Donop from being in his assigned base at Bordentown , New Jersey and in a position to assist Johann Rall 's brigade in Trenton , New Jersey when it was attacked and defeated by George Washington after his troops crossed the Delaware on the night of December 25 \u2013 26 . = = Background = = In July 1776 forces of Great Britain under the command of General William Howe landed on Staten Island . Over the next several months , Howe 's forces , which were British Army regulars and auxiliary German troops usually referred to as Hessian , chased George Washington 's Continental Army out of New York City and across New Jersey . Washington 's army , which was shrinking in size due to expiring enlistments , and desertions due to poor morale , took refuge in Pennsylvania on the western shore of the Delaware River in November , removing all the available watercraft to deny the British any opportunity to cross the wide river . General Howe established a chain of outposts across New Jersey , and ordered his troops into winter quarters . The southernmost outposts were located at Trenton and Bordentown . The Trenton outpost was manned by about 1,500 men of a Hessian brigade under the command of Johann Rall , and the Bordentown outpost was manned by Hessians and the British 42nd Regiment contingents , about 2,000 troops in all , under the command of the Hessian Colonel Carl von Donop . Bordentown itself was not large enough to house all of von Donop 's force . While he had hoped to quarter some troops even further south at Burlington , where there was strong Loyalist support , floating gun batteries from the Pennsylvania Navy threatened the town , and Donop , rather than expose Loyalist allies to their fire , was forced to scatter his troops throughout the surrounding countryside . As the troops of von Donop and Rall occupied the last outposts , they were often exposed to the actions of rebel raids and the actions of Patriot militia forces that either arose spontaneously or were recruited by Army regulars . These actions frayed the nerves of the troops , as the uncertainty of when and where such attacks would take place , and by what size force , put the men and their commanders on edge , leading them to jump up to investigate every rumored movement . Rall went so far as to order his men to sleep \" fully dressed like [ they were ] on watch . \" One militia force that rose in December 1776 was a company under the command of Virginia Colonel Samuel Griffin . Griffin ( whose name is sometimes misspelled \" Griffith \" ) was the adjutant to General Israel Putnam , who was responsible for the defense of Philadelphia . Griffin 's force , whose exact composition is uncertain , probably included some Virginia artillerymen , Pennsylvania infantry , and New Jersey militia , and numbered five to six hundred . By mid-December he had reached Moorestown , about ten miles southwest of Mount Holly . By December 21 , Griffin had advanced to Mount Holly and established a rough fortification atop a hill near an iron works , south of the Rancocas Creek and the village center . Von Donop sent a Loyalist to investigate , who reported a force of \" not above eight hundred , nearly one half boys , and all of them Militia a very few from Pennsylvania excepted \" . Thomas Stirling , who commanded a contingent of the 42nd positioned about seven miles north of Mount Holly at Blackhorse ( present-day Columbus ) , heard rumors that there were 1,000 rebels at Mount Holly and \" 2,000 more were in the rear to support them \" . When von Donop asked Stirling for advice , he replied , \" You sir , with the troops at Bordentown , should come here and attack . I am confident we are a match for them . \" = = Battle = = On December 21 , about 600 of Griffin 's troops overwhelmed a guard outpost of the 42nd located about one mile south of Blackhorse at Petticoat Bridge . On the evening of December 22 , Washington 's adjutant , Joseph Reed , went to Mount Holly and met with Griffin . Griffin had written to Reed , requesting small field pieces to assist in their actions , and Reed , who had been discussing a planned attack on Rall 's men in Trenton with Washington , wanted to see if Griffin 's company could participate in some sort of diversionary attack . Griffin was ill , and his men poorly equipped for significant action , but they apparently agreed to some sort of actions the next day . On the morning of December 23 , von Donop brought about 3,000 troops ( the 42nd British ( Highland ) Regiment and the Hessian Grenadier battalions Block and Linsing ) to Petticoat Bridge where they overwhelmed Griffin 's men . Griffin 's troops retreated to Mount Holly where von Donop reported scattering about 1,000 men near the town 's meeting house . J\u00e4ger Captain Johann Ewald reported that \" some 100 men \" were posted on a hill \" near the church \" , who \" retired quickly \" after a few rounds of artillery were fired . Griffin , whose troops had occupied Mount Holly , slowly retreated to their fortified position on the hill , following which the two sides engaged in ineffectual long-range fire . = = Aftermath = = Von Donop 's forces bivouacked in Mount Holly on the night of December 23 , where , according to Ewald , they plundered the town , breaking into alcohol stores of abandoned houses and getting drunk . Von Donop himself took quarters in the house that Ewald described as belonging to an \" exceedingly beautiful widow of a doctor \" , whose identity is uncertain . The next day , December 24 , they moved in force to drive the militia from the hill , but Griffin and his men had retreated to Moorestown during the night . For whatever reason , von Donop and his contingents remained in Mount Holly , 18 miles ( 29 km ) and a full day 's march from Trenton , until a messenger arrived on December 26 , bringing the news of Rall 's defeat by Washington that morning . News of the skirmishes at Mount Holly was often exaggerated . Published accounts of the day varied , including among participants in the battle . One Pennsylvanian claimed that sixteen of the enemy were killed , while a New Jersey militiaman reported seven enemy killed . Both Donop and Ewald specifically denied any British or German casualties occurred during the first skirmish on December 22 , while the Pennsylvania Evening Post reported \" several \" enemy casualties with \" two killed and seven or eight wounded \" of the militia through the whole action . Some reporters , including Loyalist Joseph Galloway , assumed that Griffin had been specifically sent to draw von Donop away from Bordentown , but von Donop 's decision to attack in force was apparently made prior to Reed 's arrival . Reed noted in his journal that \" this manouver [ sic ] , though perfectly accidental , had a happy effect as it drew off Count Donop .... \" The planning for Washington 's crossing of the Delaware did include sending a militia force to Griffin in an attack on von Donop at Mount Holly ; this company failed to cross the river . = = Legacy = = The hill that Griffin 's militia occupied is located at Iron Works Park in Mount Holly . The battle is reenacted annually .",
                "Battle of Short Hills = The Battle of Short Hills ( also known as the Battle of Metuchen Meetinghouse and other names ) was a conflict between a Continental Army force commanded by Brigadier General William Alexander ( \" Lord Stirling \" ) , and an opposing British force commanded by Lieutenant General William Howe . The battle took place on June 26 , 1777 , at Scotch Plains and Metuchen , New Jersey , during the American Revolutionary War . Despite the name , no fighting occurred in modern-day Short Hills , a section of Millburn . In mid-June General Howe marched most of his army into central New Jersey in an attempt to lure George Washington 's Continental Army to a place where it might be better attacked than its defensive position in the Watchung Mountains . When Washington refused to abandon his position Howe returned to Amboy on June 22 . Washington 's forward divisions , including that of Lord Stirling , shadowed this British movement , and Washington moved his main army out of the hills . Howe seized this opportunity , and on June 26 marched two columns of troops out in an attempt to cut Washington off from the high ground . These troops skirmished with Lord Stirling 's troops , and eventually engaged in a pitched battle in Scotch Plains . Stirling 's outnumbered force retreated , but Washington , alerted to the British movement , had by then retreated back into the hills . = = Background = = In March 1776 the British forces of Lieutenant General William Howe withdrew from Boston after Major General George Washington fortified high ground threatening the city and its harbor . With this army augmented by reinforcements from Europe , General Howe captured New York City , forcing Washington to retreat all the way across New Jersey . At the end of 1776 , Washington crossed the Delaware River and surprised German troops at Trenton , New Jersey , and eventually regained control of most of the state . The two armies then settled into winter quarters , and engaged in a war of skirmishes during the winter months . General Howe spent the winter planning a campaign to capture the seat of the rebel Congress , Philadelphia . The constant skirmishing throughout the winter had taken its toll on his troops stationed in New Jersey , and even a major attack on the Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook in April had not been entirely successful . Howe apparently did not divulge his plans or his intended route to Philadelphia to many people , and General Washington did not know what his intentions were , although Philadelphia was one target he suspected Howe was interested in . On May 29 , Washington moved most of his army from its winter quarters near Morristown to a strong position at Middlebrook in the Watchung Mountains from which he could observe and interfere with British moves toward Philadelphia . Historians who mention this battle only occasionally give it a name . It is often called \" Short Hills \" , even though the battle took place primarily in present-day Edison and Scotch Plains , New Jersey . Historians also give the battle other names ; David Martin calls it \" Flat Hills \" or \" Metuchen Meeting House \" ; one British regimental history refers to it by \" Westfield \" . = = Prelude = = On June 9 , Howe began moving troops from Staten Island to Perth Amboy . On June 11 , almost his entire army moved up the roads along the Raritan River to New Brunswick . Washington 's intelligence reports indicated that Howe had left behind equipment needed for crossing the Delaware River and was unlikely to be heading for Philadelphia ; Washington , as a precautionary measure , called out the militia in southern New Jersey . On June 14 , Howe 's army marched again , its destination Somerset Court House ( present-day Millstone ) . Apparently seeking to draw Washington into battle on open terrain , Howe remained there five days . Washington refused to move out of the hills , and on June 19 , Howe began the march back to Perth Amboy , which he reached on June 22 , having completely evacuated New Brunswick . After refusing to fall for Howe 's trap , Washington followed the retreating British , bringing his army down from Middlebrook to Quibbletown , and sent a strong forward detachment under Brigadier General William Alexander ( aka \" Lord Stirling \" ) to the Scotch Plains area north of New Brunswick , to cover his left flank and to harass the British . Stirling 's command , numbering about 2,500 , comprised William Maxwell 's New Jersey brigade , Thomas Conway 's Pennsylvania brigade , Daniel Morgan 's Corps of Riflemen and Ottendorf 's Corps . Maxwell 's brigade consisted of the 1st through 4th New Jersey Continentals and Oliver Spencer 's Additional Regiment , while Conway 's consisted of the 3rd , 6th , 9th , and 12th Pennsylvania Continentals . Ottendorf 's Corps , although it was named for its principal recruiter , a German mercenary named Nicholas Dietrich , Baron de Ottendorf , was commanded by Charles Armand , a French soldier of fortune who was given its command in May 1777 after Ottendorf abruptly left the army . Howe took advantage of Washington 's movement , and launched a sudden attack against Lord Stirling 's position , meant to devastate Stirling 's forces , cut off Washington 's retreat back to Middlebrook , and engage the Americans in a pitched battle on relatively open terrain . At 1 : 00 am on the morning on June 26 Howe marched two columns of troops out of Perth Amboy . The first column , under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis , consisted of several companies of Hessian j\u00e4gers , three battalions of Hessian grenadiers and one British , mounted Hessian chasseurs and some British dragoons from the 16th Light Dragoons , a battalion from the Brigade of Guards , and the Loyalist provincial unit of Queen 's Rangers . The second column was under the command of Major General John Vaughan and accompanied by General Howe . It consisted of j\u00e4ger companies from Hesse-Kassel and Ansbach-Bayreuth , and battalions of British light infantry and grenadiers . = = The battle = = The column of General Cornwallis marched for Woodbridge , while Vaughan 's marched toward Bonhamton . As the two columns moved on roughly parallel paths through the Short Hills area , they came into contact with Stirling 's guards , and a running skirmish began , with the Americans firing on the British from the underbrush as they fell back . The retreating Americans lead both of the armies into the Ash Swamp and Scotch Plains areas , where Stirling prepared a defensive position . Severe cannon fire and strength of British numbers forced Stirling , as determined as he was to stand against them , to retreat even further back , toward Westfield . There the British , suffering under the extreme heat of the day , ended the pursuit , and Stirling was able to fall back in good order toward the post at Middlebrook . A messenger had alerted Washington to Howe 's proximity , prompting Washington to precipitately withdraw to a more secure position further in the hills . Later in the day , Howe arrived to inspect Washington 's lines and adjudged them too strong to attack . Because Stirling 's resistance may have provided Washington with enough time to manage his withdrawal to more secure ground , the battle is considered a strategic victory for the Americans . The British , after spending the night at Westfield , returned to their post at Perth Amboy , and completely evacuated New Jersey by June 30 . In mid-July , Howe embarked much of his army on transports , and sailed off toward Philadelphia , destination unknown to Washington . A local tale arose in Westfield about an encounter between General Cornwallis and \" Aunt Betty \" Frazee , a local resident who had been baking bread for the Americans . When Cornwallis arrived , he requested a loaf of bread from her . When she offered it to him , saying \" I give this not in love but in fear \" , Cornwallis graciously declined the offer , responding \" Not a man of my command shall touch a single loaf . \" = = Casualties = = A British officer recorded the British and Hessian casualties as 5 killed and 30 wounded . The only officer casualty was Captain The Honourable John Finch of the Guards Light Infantry . He had been to the forefront of the attack and , at one point , called out to Lord Stirling , \" Come here , you damned rebel , and I will do for you ! \" Stirling 's response was to instruct four marksmen to concentrate their fire upon the captain . Finch soon received a wound , from which he died three days later . The American casualties are not fully known ; the British claimed the Americans suffered 100 killed and wounded , and both sides acknowledged the American loss of three cannons , and the capture of 70 men . Ottendorf 's Corps , who had formed Stirling 's advance guard appear to have been hardest hit : out of 80 men , 32 were killed or captured . Colonel Israel Shreve , commander of the 2nd New Jersey Regiment wrote on July 6 , 1777 that Maxwell 's Brigade \" had 12 killed and about 20 wounded and as many taken prisoners ... \" ; he also noted in his journal , \" We had between 20 & 30 Wounded ... mostly slightly Except 3 or 4 ... \" Two officers are recorded as having been lost in the 2nd New Jersey : Captain Ephraim Anderson , killed , and Captain James Lawrie , captured . = = Legacy = = An area of the battlefield , encompassing about 300 acres ( 120 ha ) in Edison Township , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014 . The area includes portions of the municipal land , as well as a part of the Plainfield Country Club . Edison 's Oak Tree Pond Park is used as a reenactment site of the battle ."

                    "text": "Battle of Fort Anne = The Battle of Fort Anne , fought on July 8 , 1777 , was an engagement between Continental Army forces in retreat from Fort Ticonderoga and forward elements of John Burgoyne 's much larger British army that had driven them from Ticonderoga , early in the Saratoga campaign of the American Revolutionary War . Burgoyne , surprised by the American withdrawal from Fort Ticonderoga , hurried as many of his troops as possible forward in pursuit of the retreating Americans . The main body of the American forces had departed Fort Independence down the road to Hubbardton , and a smaller body of troops , accompanying the sick , wounded , and camp followers that had also evacuated the fort , had sailed up Lake Champlain to Skenesboro , moving from there overland to Fort Edward . This group , which included about 600 men under arms , paused at Fort Anne , where a smaller advance company from Burgoyne 's army caught up to them . The British , clearly outnumbered , sent for reinforcements . The Americans decided to attack while they had the numerical advantage , and succeeded in nearly surrounding the British position about three quarters of a mile ( 1 km ) north of the fort . The Americans retreated back to the fort when war whoops indicated the arrival of British reinforcements . While this was a ruse ( the reinforcements were a single officer ) , it saved the British force from probable capture . More of Burgoyne 's army soon came down the road , forcing the Americans to retreat from Fort Anne to Fort Edward . It has been claimed that a flag was flown at Fort Anne that may have been the first instance of a flag consisting of stars and stripes ; this claim is supposedly false . = = Background = = On the night of July 5 \u2013 6 , the Continental Army forces occupying Fort Ticonderoga were ordered to evacuate the fort by General Arthur St. Clair , following the approach of General John Burgoyne 's 8,000-man army . Burgoyne 's men had placed a gun battery on top of Mount Defiance , overlooking the fort , and the American avenues of retreat were at risk of being cut off . Most of the American forces left Ticonderoga and the surrounding defense works via Fort Independence and the road to Hubbardton . About 600 men under Colonel Pierse Long , most of them from New Hampshire , sailed up the lake in a flotilla consisting of 5 armed galleys and over 200 smaller transport vessels . These vessels were loaded with as many of the sick from the fort as they could take , stores and supplies , and armaments . Believing the log boom and pontoon bridge placed between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence to be sufficient to delay the British pursuit , Long began to sail up the lake toward Skenesboro , the southernmost navigable point on the lake , at a leisurely pace . = = Pursuit = = The British , however , were hardly slowed down by the water defenses . Burgoyne , once he learned of the American withdrawal on the morning of July 6 , ordered the defenses to be taken down . With well-placed gunfire , the bridge and boom were eliminated as obstacles in the space of 30 minutes . At this point Burgoyne , breaking with rigid military discipline , ordered troops to follow southward as rapidly as possible , instead of remaining in formation , while he sailed southward in pursuit . Assisted by favorable winds , he was within three miles ( 4.8 km ) of Skenesboro by the end of July 6 , where the Americans , who arrived only two hours earlier , had a small stockade fort . In an attempt to surround the position , Burgoyne landed about 200 men from the 9th , 20th , and 21st regiments , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Hill , at a point south of Skenesboro with the objective of cutting off the road to Fort Anne . The Americans were in the process of portaging around the falls at Skenesboro to Wood Creek when Burgoyne 's boats arrived and opened fire . Enterprise , Liberty , and Gates were destroyed by the Americans , and two ships , Trumbull and Revenge , were forced to surrender . In the process many of the American supplies were either destroyed or abandoned to the British . The Americans retreated toward Fort Anne in disarray , but not before starting a fire that eventually engulfed most of the structures at Skenesboro . When they reached Fort Anne they were met by 400 New York militia under Henry van Rensselaer , that had been sent by General Philip Schuyler from Fort Edward after he received news of the retreat from Ticonderoga . The British pursuers under Hill , when they finally reached the road , captured more American supplies , sick and wounded , and camp followers that trailed behind the main body , and moved south until they were about one mile ( 1.6 km ) from Fort Anne . Here they encountered an American reconnaissance party numbering about 170 under Captain James Gray ; in the ensuing skirmish one American was killed and three more wounded before the Americans retreated to the fort . = = Battle = = On the morning of July 8 , a supposed American deserter , who was really a spy , informed Hill that the fort was occupied by nearly 1,000 demoralized troops . Opting not to attack the numerically superior force , Hill sent a message back to Burgoyne outlining the situation . Burgoyne ordered the 20th and 21st regiments to quick-march toward Fort Anne in support , but poor weather hampered their movement , and they did not arrive until after the battle . The \" deserter \" returned to Fort Anne and reported on the British position and troop strength . Long , seeing how few British soldiers were following him , decided to attack their position . Moving as stealthily as possible , his force tried to surround the British while they were still on the road . However , Hill 's men heard the rebel movements on their flanks and retreated to a higher position , abandoning some wounded men , who were eventually captured by the Americans . When the Americans opened fire , it was \" a heavy and well-directed fire \" , according to one British officer . The battle lasted for more than 2 hours , until both sides were nearly out of ammunition , and the British were virtually surrounded by Americans . The sound of Indian war whoops from the north prompted the Americans to retreat , and they retired to the fort with their wounded , including Van Rensselaer , who had taken a shot in the hip . As it turned out , there were no Indians , but only a single British officer , John Money of the 9th regiment , Burgoyne 's deputy quartermaster . He had been leading a group of Indians , but when they seemed reluctant to fight the Americans , Money became impatient and ran ahead of them ; it was his war cries that brought an end to the battle . = = Aftermath = = Back at the fort the Americans held a brief council . From a woman that the British had freed , they heard that 2,000 or more British troops under the command of General Phillips were rapidly advancing . Long 's men , as they were nearly out of ammunition , withdrew toward Fort Edward , burning the stockaded fort . Both sides claimed victory in the battle , since the British had successfully stood their ground , and the Americans had very nearly forced them to surrender . Any American claim for victory was tempered by the fact that the force they had defeated was clearly the vanguard of a much larger British force . A British officer recovered some regimental banners either during this engagement , or following the American retreat from Fort Anne . It is widely claimed that one of the flags captured was a new design of American flag with thirteen red and white stripes and a constellation of stars , representing the earliest known use of the stars and stripes motif . However , this story is likely untrue , as the time needed for news of the flag design approved by Congress to travel , followed by construction of such a flag and then its delivery to such a remote location render the story implausible , and the flags known to have been recovered bear no resemblance whatsoever to the United States flag .",

                    "text": "Siege of St. Augustine ( 1702 ) = The Siege of St. Augustine was an action in Queen Anne 's War during November and December 1702 . It was conducted by English provincial forces from the Province of Carolina and their native allies , under the command of Carolina 's governor James Moore , against the Spanish colonial fortress of Castillo de San Marcos at St. Augustine , in Spanish Florida . After destroying coastal Spanish communities north of St. Augustine , Moore 's forces arrived at St. Augustine on 10 November , and immediately began siege operations . The Spanish governor , Jos\u00e9 de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y la Cerda , had advance warning of their arrival , and withdrew civilians and food supplies into the fortress , and also sent messengers to nearby Spanish and French communities for relief . The English guns did little damage to the fortress walls , prompting Governor Moore to send an appeal to Jamaica for larger guns . The Spanish calls for relief were successful ; a fleet sent from Havana , Cuba landed troops nearby on 29 December . Moore lifted the siege the next day , and was forced to burn many of his boats before retreating to Charles Town in disgrace . = = Background = = English and Spanish colonization efforts in southeastern North America began coming into conflict as early as the middle of the 17th century . The founding in 1670 by the English of Charles Town ( present-day Charleston , South Carolina ) in the recently established ( 1663 ) Province of Carolina heightened tensions . Traders , raiders , and slavers from the new province penetrated into Spanish Florida , leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides . In 1700 , Carolina 's governor , Joseph Blake , threatened the Spanish that English claims to Pensacola , established by the Spanish in 1698 , would be enforced . Blake 's death later that year interrupted these plans , and he was replaced in 1702 by James Moore . Even before news of the war declarations opening the War of the Spanish Succession arrived in the colonies , Moore proposed an expedition against Spanish Florida 's capital , St. Augustine . News of the war 's formal opening arrived in 1702 , and Moore convinced the provincial assembly in September 1702 to fund an expedition against St. Augustine . Moore raised a force of colonists and Indians , the latter a combination of Yamasee , Tallapoosa , and Alabama warriors , principally led by a Yamasee chief named Arratommakaw . The exact size of these forces varies by source ; accounts provide numbers ranging from 800 to 1,200 in strength ; most sources say that about 500 colonists and 300 \u2013 400 Indians took part . Some of this force , primarily the Indians , went overland to Port Royal under the command of Deputy Governor Robert Daniell , while Moore embarked the rest of the force on 14 boats . These forces joined at Port Royal , and Daniell 's force was landed on what is now known as Amelia Island ( it was called Isla Santa Maria by the Spanish , and was part of Florida 's Guale Province ) , while Moore sailed on to Matanzas Bay . The Castillo de San Marcos at St. Augustine was built in the later years of the 17th century , in part because previous English raids demonstrated the inadequacy of wooden fortifications , and to address the threat posed by the founding of Charles Town . The fortress , a fairly conventional star fort , was constructed from soft coquina limestone . Governor Joseph de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Z\u00e9rda assumed command of the post in 1700 . Natives friendly to the Spanish heard of the recruitment , and word of the expedition reached Z\u00fa\u00f1iga on October 27 . He ordered the town 's inhabitants into the fort , commandeered all food stores in anticipation of an extended siege , and dispatched messengers to Pensacola , Havana , and the French at Mobile with calls for assistance . Refugees swelled the civilian population to about 1,500 , of which only a small number were deemed capable of military action . Z\u00fa\u00f1iga estimated the food provisions brought in to be sufficient for a siege of three months ' duration . Some of Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 's men wanted to do battle with the English ; the governor identified , in addition to 174 regulars and 14 artillerymen , 44 Europeans from the population that were fit for action , 123 Indians ( most armed with poor-quality or useless weapons ) , and 57 black men ( freemen , mulattoes , and slaves ) of which only 20 had any experience with weapons . Z\u00fa\u00f1iga did not consider either the Indians or the Negroes to be trustworthy , and estimated that only about 70 men of this entire force were actually prepared for a battle . He consequently prepared for a siege . His principal concern was the training of the artillerymen , of whom he wrote that they \" had no service record , lacked discipline , and have only a slight knowledge of the ... guns which are mounted . \" = = English approach = = Daniell 's forces landed on Amelia Island , and began attacks on the northern end of the island at midnight on 3 November , killing two Spanish soldiers and overrunning the village of San Pedro de Tupiqui . They advanced south , driving southward a flood of refugees and the few Spanish troops on the island . The main settlements at San Felipe and San Marcos were overrun the next day , as the Spanish were in the process of evacuating them . Z\u00fa\u00f1iga learned of the advance on 5 November , and sent 20 men under Captain Joseph de Horruytiner north , with instructions to make a stand at San Juan del Puerto , seven leagues from St. Augustine , which Z\u00fa\u00f1iga saw as the \" key to the province of Guale \" . The news also prompted Z\u00fa\u00f1iga to mobilize all able-bodied men over 14 , and order all available food into the fort . Horruytiner never made it beyond the St. Johns River ; he did capture three enemy soldiers ( two Englishmen and a Chiluque Indian ) on 6 November , and returned with them to St. Augustine two days later . Z\u00fa\u00f1iga learned from these captives that the English had brought three months ' provisions , and that they had only brought smaller cannons ( 6 to 10 pounders ) . In the meantime , Moore sailed south with the fleet . Three ships were sent ahead of the main fleet to blockade the entrance to Matanzas Bay , south of St. Augustine . These were spotted from the fort on 7 November . The next day the main body of the fleet began arriving at the bar outside the St. Augustine inlet . This prompted Z\u00fa\u00f1iga to order his two frigates , La Gloria and Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Piedad y el Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas , to anchor under the fort 's guns . The Nuestra , which was outside the bar , was unable to cross , and was eventually burned . Sixteen of her men joined the fort 's garrison , providing valuable gunnery skills . Daniell 's force , after being landed , made good progress . The small Spanish force on Amelia Island was unable to check the English advance at San Juan del Puerto , and was dispersed ; some of them took days to reach St. Augustine . Daniels continued to advance , and entered the town of St. Augustine without resistance on 10 November . Eight of the English ships crossed the bar and began landing men that day . As the English began to close the circle around the fortress , a Spanish foraging expedition successfully drove 163 head of cattle through the English lines and into the fort 's ( dry ) moat . = = Siege = = The Spanish guns opened fire on the English as they began siege preparations on 10 November . One of the older Spanish cannon exploded that day , killing three and wounding five . A few days later , Z\u00fa\u00f1iga ordered a sally to destroy portions of the town within firing range of the fort ; according to later accounts , this action destroyed more than 15,000 pesos worth of property . Moore had brought four small cannon , but these made little impression on the coquina walls of the fortress , and the Spanish guns had longer range , keeping most of his forces at bay . Around November 22 , Moore dispatched Deputy Governor Daniell to Jamaica for larger cannons and ammunition . The English continued digging siege trenches , and began firing on the fortress from musket range on November 24 . This cannon fire continued to have little effect , and Moore ordered more of the town torched the next day , including the Franciscan monastery . Since his cannon were not effective against the fort 's walls , Moore attempted a deception to gain entry to the fort . On 14 December a Yamasee couple managed to gain entry to the fort posing as refugees , apparently with the goal of detonating the fort 's powder magazine . However , Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was suspicious of their behavior and , according to his account of the siege , they were tortured into admitting the plot . By 19 December the English trenches had closed on the fort to the point that they threatened nearby fields from which the Spanish had been collecting forage . As a result , Z\u00fa\u00f1iga ordered a sally . There was a skirmish , and Spanish casualties were light : one killed and several wounded . = = Relief attempts = = Spanish leaders at San Luis de Apalachee ( present-day Tallahassee , Florida ) began mobilizing when they received the news of the siege . Short on supplies , they appealed to the French at Mobile , who provided critical guns and gunpowder ; the Pensacola garrison also spared ten men . The relief force left San Luis de Apalachee on December 24 , but turned back when news was received that the siege had been lifted . Also on December 24 , sails from a pair of ships were spotted approaching St. Augustine . English records do not indicate what these ships were ; Spanish records show that they were English in origin , but probably not from Jamaica , since the nature of the siege did not change with their arrival . The expedition to Jamaica , having failed in its mission , returned directly to Charles Town . Spanish messengers from Pensacola eventually reported St. Augustine 's plight to Havana . Governor Pedro Nicol\u00e1s Ben\u00edtez held a war council on December 2 , in which a relief expedition was organized . A detachment of over 200 infantry under the command of Captain L\u00f3pez de Solloso was embarked on a small fleet headed by General Estevan de Berroa in the Black Eagle . Berroa 's fleet arrived outside St. Augustine 's harbor on December 28 . Apparently believing the siege to already be over , Berroa did not land any troops . The next day , Governor Z\u00fa\u00f1iga sneaked some men out of the fort and made contact with the fleet . Berroa then landed Solloso and about 70 raw recruits on Anastasia Island , about 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) below the fort . This action prompted Moore to lift the siege and prepare a retreat . Berroa also dispatched smaller ships to block the southern inlet to Matanzas Bay , trapping some of Moore 's ships in the bay . Moore ordered the remaining buildings in the town , including the church , put to the torch . Some of his men departed north via the mainland , while the rest crossed Matanzas Bay to their boats . Moore burned the eight ships trapped in the bay , and retreated to the north , eventually returning to Charles Town in disgrace . Z\u00fa\u00f1iga sent men out after the English departure ; they were able to recover three of the English boats that failed to burn completely . Casualty reports made by both sides varied ; historian Charles Arnade notes that all of the numbers reported are probably unreliable . Moore 's report listed only two men killed , while Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in his report claimed that more than 60 of the English force were killed . Z\u00fa\u00f1iga claimed only three or four killed and 20 wounded for the Spanish contingent , none of which were caused by English cannon fire . = = Aftermath = = Moore was forced to resign his post as governor because of the failed raid , and its cost to the province ( which included compensating owners for the loss of their ships ) caused riots in Charles Town . Some of Moore 's contemporary critics accused him of executing the raid for the purpose of seizing slaves or booty ; the Spanish characterized it in religious terms , citing the \" English provincial hatred against the Church of God . \" Moore continued to be active in the war , leading a small number of Carolinians and a large band of Indians on the destruction of Spanish missions in Florida in 1704 . By 1705 the English and their Indian allies had destroyed 32 Spanish mission communities , and by 1711 there were reported to be only about 400 Indians left in Florida . Governor Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was rewarded for his successful defense with a special commendation from the king and promotion to the more prestigious and desirable governorship of Cartagena . He made a series of highly critical complaints of General Berroa : the general failed to destroy the English fleet ; he failed to share the plunder taken from the ships burned by the English ; he refused to leave any of his fleet to assist in protection of the town ; and he landed only the weakest and least effective troops in a bid to avoid combat . The general also sailed for Havana on January 8 , barely one week after the siege was lifted . In 1704 Governor Z\u00fa\u00f1iga convinced some Spanish privateers to raid the Carolina coast in revenge for Moore 's activities . Spanish and French forces , motivated and organized by Pierre Le Moyne d 'Iberville ( who died shortly before its departure ) , attempted the capture of Charles Town in August 1706 ; their attempts to land forces were successfully repulsed . The Castillo de San Marcos was not subjected to further attacks in the war . The expedition destroyed all but two communities in the provinces of Guale and Timucua ; Spanish Florida never really recovered from the decimation of its population in the following years . St. Augustine was again unsuccessfully besieged in 1740 by forces from the Province of Georgia , and the castillo underwent numerous renovations and uses in the 18th and 19th centuries . It is now a National Monument managed by the National Park Service , and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

                    "text": "Powder Alarm = The Powder Alarm was a major popular reaction to the removal of gunpowder from a magazine by British soldiers under orders from General Thomas Gage , royal governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , on September 1 , 1774 . In response to this action , amid rumors that blood had been shed , alarm spread through the countryside to Connecticut and beyond , and American Patriots sprang into action , fearing that war was at hand . Thousands of militiamen began streaming toward Boston and Cambridge , and mob action forced Loyalists and some government officials to flee to the protection of the British Army . Although it proved to be a false alarm , the Powder Alarm caused political and military leaders to proceed more carefully in the days ahead , and essentially provided a \" dress rehearsal \" for the Battles of Lexington and Concord seven and a half months later . Furthermore , actions on both sides to control weaponry , gunpowder , and other military supplies became more contentious , as the British sought to bring military stores more directly under their control , and the Patriot colonists sought to acquire them for their own use . = = Background = = In 1772 , many of the thirteen British colonies , in response to unpopular British actions and the negative British reaction to the Gaspee Affair ( the destruction by colonists of a grounded ship involved in enforcing customs regulations ) , elected to form Committees of Correspondence . These allowed communities to formally communicate with each other , raise awareness of incidents occurring elsewhere , and to coordinate actions ; as such , they became instrumental in managing the colonial response to enforcement of the Tea Act , the Intolerable Acts , and other unpopular British colonial legislation . The colonists of Massachusetts had not yet taken concerted action to organize themselves militarily against actions of the British regulars , although statements were made about supporting Boston ( whose port had been closed earlier in 1774 under the Boston Port Act ) \" at the risque of our lives and fortunes . \" General Thomas Gage , who had become the military governor of Massachusetts in May 1774 , was charged with enforcement of the highly unpopular Intolerable Acts , which British Parliament had passed in response to the Boston Tea Party . Seeking to prevent the outbreak of war and to keep the peace between the American Patriot ( Whig ) majority and the Loyalist ( Tory ) minority , he believed that the best way to accomplish this was by secretly removing military stores from storehouses and arsenals in New England . The secrecy of these missions was paramount , as Gage feared that leakage of any plans would result in the seizure or concealment of the stores by Patriot sympathizers before his men got there . There were several places throughout the colonies where the British army had stockpiled supplies . Some of these places were fortifications that were manned by small garrisons ; others were merely locked magazines . Most of the powder in these was under the control of the provincial government , though some was the property of individual towns . One locked storehouse near Boston , in what was then part of Charlestown , now Powder House Square in Somerville , was controlled by William Brattle , the leader of the provincial militia and an appointee of the governor . Brattle , who had not obviously sided with either Loyalists or Patriots , notified Governor Gage in a letter dated August 27 that the provincial ( \" King 's \" ) powder was the only supply remaining in that storehouse , as the towns had removed all of theirs . Gage decided that this powder had to be brought to Boston for safekeeping . = = Expedition = = On August 31 , Gage sent Middlesex County sheriff David Phips to Brattle with orders to remove the provincial powder ; Brattle turned the key to the powderhouse over to Phips . Gage also gave orders to ready a force of troops for action the next day , something that did not go unnoticed by the local population . At some point that day , General Gage , whether by his intent , accident , or theft by a messenger , lost possession of William Brattle 's letter ; the widely held story is that it was dropped . News of its content spread rapidly , and many considered it to be a warning to Gage to remove the provincial powder before Patriots could seize it . Early in the morning of September 1 , a force of roughly 260 British regulars from the 4th Regiment , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Maddison , were rowed in secrecy up the Mystic River from Boston to a landing point near Winter Hill in modern-day Somerville . From there they marched about a mile to the Powder House , a gunpowder magazine that held the largest supply of gunpowder in Massachusetts . Phips gave the King 's Troops the keys to the building , and after sunrise they removed all of the gunpowder . Most of the regulars then returned to Boston the way they had come , but a small contingent marched to Cambridge , removed two field pieces , and took them to Boston by foot over the Great Bridge and up Boston Neck . The field pieces and powder were then taken from Boston to the British stronghold on Castle Island , then known as Castle William ( renamed Fort Independence in 1779 ) . = = Response to the raid = = Rumors flew throughout the day across the countryside about the British troop movements . The regulars were marching ; provincial powder had been seized ; war was at hand ; people had been killed ; Boston was being bombarded by His Majesty 's warships . The alarm spread as far as Connecticut . From all over the region , people took up arms and began streaming toward Boston . One traveler in Shrewsbury reported that in the space of 15 minutes , 50 men had gathered , equipped themselves , sent out messengers to surrounding towns , and left for Boston . On the 2nd , several thousand men bent on violence gathered in Cambridge , where they forced several notable Loyalists , including William Brattle , to flee to Boston and the protection of the military . Sheriff Phips was forced , in writing , to dissociate himself from any and all government actions . Eventually facts caught up with the rumors , and militia units ( some of which were still heading toward Boston ) returned home . Also on the 2nd , Boston newspapers published a letter from William Brattle in which he protested that he had not warned Gage to remove the powder ; Gage had requested from him an accounting of the storehouse 's contents , and he had complied . The content of his letter to Gage would be published on the 5th . Brattle remained on Castle Island through the siege of Boston , leaving when the British evacuated the city in March 1776 . He died in Halifax , Nova Scotia in October 1776 at the age of 70 . When the horrid news was brought here of the bombardment of Boston , which made us completely miserable for two days , we saw proofs of both the sympathy and the resolution of the continent . War ! war ! war ! was the cry , and it was pronounced in a tone which would have done honor to the oratory of a Briton or a Roman . If it had proved true , you would have heard the thunder of an American Congress . = = British reaction = = Gage , surprised by the size and scope of the colonial reaction , delayed and eventually cancelled a second planned expedition to the storehouse in Worcester . He concentrated his troops in Boston , and called for reinforcements from London , writing \" if you think ten thousand men sufficient , send twenty ; if one million is thought enough , give two ; you save both blood and treasure in the end . \" However , Gage 's request was seen by some in London as absurd , as there were only 12,000 troops in Britain at the time , but he did eventually receive an additional 400 Marines in response to these requests . He later began planning and executing seizures again , and he further fortified the Boston peninsula . = = Colonial reaction = = After the Powder Alarm , militia forces throughout New England were more cautious with their supplies and more intent on gaining information about Gage 's plans and troop movements . Paul Revere played a significant role in distributing this information due to his geographical position in Boston , his social position as a middle-class craftsman in contact with all social classes , and his political position as a well-known Patriot propagandist and organizer . = = = The colonists organize = = = On September 21 , 1774 , Patriot leaders met in Worcester and urged town meetings to organize a third of the militias into special companies of minutemen in constant readiness to march . They also instituted the system of express riders and alarms that would prove to be critical at Lexington and Concord . In October , the former legislature of Massachusetts met in defiance of the Massachusetts Government Act and declared itself to be the First Provincial Congress . It created a Committee of Safety modeled after a body with the same name during the English Civil War and it recommended that a quarter of the militia be designated as minutemen . Military stores were to be stockpiled away from the coast ( more than a convenient day 's march ) , to make attempts to seize them more difficult . The largest stockpiles were located at Concord and Worcester . = = = Portsmouth Alarm = = = Early in December , British military command voted to prohibit the export of arms and powder to North America , and to secure all remaining stores . On December 12 , intelligence received by Paul Revere indicated that a seizure of stores at Fort William and Mary in Portsmouth , New Hampshire was imminent . He rode from Boston to Portsmouth the next day to notify the local Patriots , who quickly raided the fort on the 14th and removed its supplies . Revere 's intelligence had been incorrect ; although a British operation had been contemplated , it had not been ordered . The British did send ships carrying troops to Portsmouth , and they arrived three days after the fort 's supplies were removed . The first arrived on the 17th , and was directed into shallows at high tide by a local Patriot pilot , much to the captain 's anger . Stores of gunpowder \u2014 typically referred to by Loyalists as \" the King 's powder \" but in contrast by Patriots as \" the militia 's powder \" \u2014 were also carried off from forts in Newport , Rhode Island , Providence , Rhode Island , and New London , Connecticut and distributed to the militias in towns away from the coast . Cannon and other supplies were smuggled out of Boston and Charlestown . = = = Salem confrontation = = = On February 27 , 1775 , HMS Lively brought a force of about 240 British regulars from the 64th Regiment under Colonel Alexander Leslie to confiscate weapons in Salem , Massachusetts . They were stopped by a small crowd that raised a drawbridge in their path and taunted them while others moved the cannon to safety and sent for help from nearby towns . Eventually , the drawbridge was lowered and the regulars were permitted to search the forge where the cannon had once been . They returned to their ship while being mocked by a growing force of irregulars marching along in lock-step next to them . There were minor scuffles , but no shots were fired .",

( born May 16 , 1945 ) , known as Jim Moran , is a former U.S. Representative for Virginia 's 8th congressional district in Northern Virginia , including the cities of Falls Church and Alexandria , all of Arlington County , and a portion of Fairfax County . Congressman Moran served from 1991 to 2015 , and is a member of the Democratic Party . Moran was the mayor of Alexandria , Virginia from 1985 to 1990 , when he resigned to run for Congress . He defeated Republican incumbent Stanford Parris in the general election on November 6 , 1990 , and was sworn in the following January . He is of Irish descent , and is the son of professional football player James Patrick Moran Sr. and the brother of former Democratic Party of Virginia Chairman Brian Moran . Moran announced on January 15 , 2014 , that he would retire from Congress at the end of his term . Moran is currently a professor of practice in the School of Public and International Affairs in the College of Architecture and Urban Studies at Virginia Tech . = = Early life , education , and business career = = Moran , the eldest of seven children , was born in Buffalo , New York , and grew up in Natick , Massachusetts , a suburb of Boston . His parents were Dorothy ( n\u00e9e Dwyer ) and James Moran Sr. , a professional football player for the Boston Redskins in 1935 and 1936 ; outside of football he worked as a probation officer . Both his father and mother were Roosevelt Democrats and supporters of the New Deal . Moran attended Marian High School in Framingham , Massachusetts . Moran played college football on an athletic scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross , where his father had been a football star in the early 1930s . Moran was awarded a B.A. in economics in 1967 . In 1970 he received a Master of Public Administration from the University of Pittsburgh . After college , Moran followed his father 's footstep to become an amateur boxer , and during a campaign in 1992 , he admitted that he had used marijuana during his early twenties . After a brief career as a stockbroker and graduate school attendance , Moran moved to Washington , D.C. = = Early political career = = He worked for five years at the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , as a budget officer , then became a senior specialist for budgetary and fiscal policy at the Library of Congress . His final position , from 1976 to 1979 , was on the staff of U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations . In 1979 , Moran was elected to the Alexandria , Virginia , City Council . He was deputy mayor from 1982 until his resignation in 1984 as part of a nolo contendere plea bargain to a misdemeanor conflict of interest charge , which courts later erased . The incident stemmed from charges that Moran had used money from a political action committee to rent a tuxedo and buy Christmas cards ; both of which were later judged by the Commonwealth Attorney to \" fit the definition of constituent services \" , and were dismissed . In 1985 , Moran was elected Mayor of Alexandria . He was reelected in 1988 , and resigned after he was elected to Congress in November 1990 . = = U.S. House of Representatives = = = = = Elections = = = In 1990 , Moran first won election to the United States House of Representatives , defeating five-term Republican incumbent Stan Parris . During the campaign , Parris , referring to the issue of the Gulf War , said , \" The only three people I know who support Saddam Hussein 's position are Moammar Gadhafi , Yasser Arafat , and Jim Moran . \" Moran angrily responded by saying that Parris was \" a deceitful , fatuous jerk \" , and that he wanted \" to break his nose \" . Moran 's well-financed campaign also focused on Parris ' opposition to abortion . Moran upset Parris , winning by 7.1 percent . He was sworn into office in January 1991 . In the next two elections , Moran faced Republican lawyer Kyle McSlarrow . During the 1992 campaign , McSlarrow accused Moran of \" lying to the public \" . Moran responded by portraying McSlarrow as a drug abuser , referring to the candidate 's admitted use of cocaine and marijuana while at the University of Virginia . Moran compared McSlarrow to Parris , saying that Parris had \" [ t ] en times more integrity than McSlarrow . He didn 't create lies . \" Moran defeated McSlarrow with 56 percent of the vote . In 1994 , Moran 's daughter Dorothy was suffering from an inoperable brain tumor . During the campaign , neither Moran or McSlarrow used the negative tactics of two years earlier . On his campaign strategy that election , McSlarrow said \" It would not be a community service to shut down this campaign , but I probably will not talk much about Moran . \" Moran was reelected with 59 percent of the vote . In 1998 and 2000 , Moran faced Republican and flat tax advocate Demaris H. Miller . In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in his support of President Bill Clinton , after Moran , who had been a vocal supporter of the Clinton White House , voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the Monica Lewinsky scandal . In 2002 , Moran defeated Republican S. C. Tate and Independent R. V. Crickenberger . In June 2004 , Moran , for the first time since his election in 1990 , had a Democratic opponent in a primary . Moran defeated Alexandria attorney Andrew M. Rosenberg , 59 % to 41 % . In November , he defeated Republican Lisa Marie Cheney . In 2006 , Moran defeated Republican challenger T. M. Odonoghue and Independent J. T. Hurysz . In 2008 , Moran again had a primary challenger ; he won with 86 % of the vote . In the general election , Moran faced Republican Mark Ellmore and Independent Green Ron Fisher . He won with 68 percent of the vote to Elmore 's 30 percent . In November 2009 Ellmore announced he would again challenge Moran , but dropped out of the race four months later . In the June 2010 Republican primary , attorney Matthew Berry narrowly lost to retired U.S. Army Colonel J. Patrick Murray , after a last-minute mailing attacking Berry 's homosexuality . Fisher again was on the ballot . During the campaign , Moran was criticized by military advocacy groups and conservatives for saying , at a local Democratic committee meeting , that Murray had not \" served or performed any kind of public service \" . Moran responded by commending Murray 's military service , while saying that he used the phrase in relation to Murray not having engaged in \" local civic engagement \" and not having served in local office . In November 2010 , Moran was re-elected to an eleventh term with 61 % of the vote . In 2012 , Moran faced another primary challenger from Navy veteran Bruce Shuttleworth . A controversy erupted when the Democratic Party of Virginia disqualified Shuttleworth , saying he had fallen 17 signatures short of the 1,000 threshold required . Shuttleworth cried foul and filed a federal lawsuit ; the party then allowed Shuttleworth on the ballot . Moran went on to win by a sizable margin . In November , Moran defeated Republican J. Patrick Murray , Independent Jason J. Howell , and Independent Green Janet Murphy , winning 64 % of the vote . = = = Tenure = = = Moran represented Virginia 's 8th congressional district , an area in Northern Virginia that is just across the Potomac River from Washington , D.C. ; the district includes Arlington county , and the cities of Alexandria , Falls Church and parts of Fairfax . The redistricting that followed the 2000 census also gave Moran a portion of Reston , Virginia . His district is located in the Dulles Technology Corridor and is the home of many federal defense contractors as well as a significant number of those who work in the information technology industry . Many federal employees also reside within the district , mostly due to its proximity to Washington and because the United States Department of Defense and various other agencies are headquartered there . During the mid nineties , Moran co-founded and later co-chaired the New Democrat Coalition , a coalition of Democratic lawmakers who consider themselves to be moderates with regard to commerce , budgeting , and economic legislation , but vote as liberals on social issues . Moran was also a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus ( CPC ) , the largest caucus operating within the Democratic caucus , which works to advance progressive issues and opinions . He joined the caucus prior to the 111th Congress . = = = = 1990s = = = = In 1995 , Moran and California Republican Duke Cunningham had to be restrained by the Capitol Police after a shoving match on the house floor over President Bill Clinton 's decision to send U.S. troops to Bosnia . \" I thought he had been bullying too many people for too long , and I told him so , \" Moran recalled . \" He said he didn 't mean to be so accusatory ... After that , he would bring me candy from California . \" Moran said that after the encounter he found Cunningham crying in the cloakroom . During the final years of the Clinton administration , Moran was critical of the President : In 1998 , during the Monica Lewinsky scandal , Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton . He told Time magazine that \" This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It 's like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre , sleazy characters . \" Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister , he would have punched her husband in the nose . Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment , explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country 's security , and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President . Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of \" dishonest and illegal conduct \" surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky . = = = = 2000s = = = = Moran was voted High Technology Legislator of the Year by the Information Technology Industry Council and was voted into the American Electronics Association Hall of Fame for his work on avoiding the Year 2000 crisis and his support of the IT Industry and defense contractors in Northern Virginia . He cosponsored failed bills in 2005 to provide the District of Columbia with a House seat and to prohibit slaughter of horses . On April 28 , 2006 , Moran , along with four other members of Congress ( the now-deceased Rep. Tom Lantos of California , Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas , and James McGovern and John Olver of Massachusetts ) , and six other activists , were arrested for disorderly conduct in front of the Sudanese embassy in Washington , D.C. , and spent 45 minutes in a jail cell before being released . They were protesting the alleged role of Sudan 's government in ethnic cleansing in Darfur . According to the San Francisco Chronicle , \" Their protest and civil disobedience was designed to embarrass the military dictatorship 's ongoing genocide of its non-Arab citizens . \" The day after the Virginia Tech Massacre in 2007 , Moran told a local radio station that the Federal Assault Weapons Ban should be reinstated and blamed the National Rifle Association , which he accused of getting a \" free ride \" , and President George W. Bush for blocking gun control legislation . He further warned that if gun control legislation was not passed , then shootings such as the one at Virginia Tech will happen \" time and time again . \" He later dismissed charges that he was politicizing the shooting , telling Politico that \" as a legislator , your immediate reaction is to think something could be done to avoid this . I don 't know why the idea of figuring out how to avoid it is a political partisan issue . \" Shortly before the June 2008 Virginia Democratic primary , Moran endorsed Senator Barack Obama of Illinois for the presidency over New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton . Explaining his endorsement , he told a local newspaper that the long-term goal of closing Alexandria 's coal-fired power plant would be more attainable under Obama than under Clinton . Obama won the Virginia primary , and carried the state when he won the general election in November . In May 2009 , Moran introduced a bill that would restrict broadcast advertisements for erectile dysfunction or male enhancement medication . He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm , in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy . Later that year , Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston , Virginia . The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters , most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry , who , along with about half a dozen supporters , caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police . The incident was replayed several times over the next few weeks on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall . In February 2010 , on the House floor , Moran called for the repeal of Don 't Ask , Don 't Tell , the military policy of discharging soldiers on active duty who are openly homosexual . He spoke about a letter penned by a gay soldier who was then serving in the Afghanistan War , who had \" learned that a fellow soldier was also gay , only after he was killed by an IED in Iraq . The partner of the deceased soldier wrote the unit to say how much the victim had loved the military ; how they were the only family he had ever known ... This immutable human trait , sexual orientation , like the color of one 's skin , does not affect one \u2019 s integrity , their honor , our commitment to their country . Soldiers serving their country in combat should not have their sacrifices compounded by having to struggle with an antiquated Don \u2019 t ask , don \u2019 t tell policy . Let 's do the right and honorable thing and repeal this policy . \" As a member of the House Appropriations Committee , Moran worked to allocate federal funding to projects in Northern Virginia , usually in the technology and defense industries . He also assisted in authorizing the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge , a bridge between Alexandria , Virginia , and Prince George 's County , Maryland , which had gained a reputation over the years among Northern Virginia residents as the site of numerous rush-hour traffic jams . On March 9 , 2010 , Moran was named to succeed Norm Dicks of Washington as the chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee . The chairmanship gave Moran authority over appropriations to the Department of the Interior , the Bureau of Indian Affairs , and the National Endowment for the Arts ; among other things . Moran said he was excited to be able to play a role in protecting the environment and conserving natural resources . = = = = 2010s = = = = Moran became the ranking member of the subcommittee after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives following the November 2010 elections . After President Obama 's 2011 State of the Union Address , Moran was interviewed by Alhurra , an Arab television network . During the interview , he said , \" a lot of people in [ the United States of America ] ... don 't want to be governed by an African-American \" and that the Democrats lost seats in the 2010 election for \" the same reason the Civil War happened in the United States ... the Southern states , particularly the slaveholding states , didn 't want to see a president who was opposed to slavery . \" The remarks received national media attention . The Washington Post 's Jennifer Rubin said the remarks were \" beyond uncivil \" and \" obnoxious \" . On March 16 , 2012 , Moran was arrested outside the Sudanese embassy in Washington , DC , at a protest against human rights abuses perpetrated by the Sudanese government , specifically bombings in the Nuba Mountains and refusal to allow humanitarian aid organizations access to refugees . He was charged with disorderly conduct and released , along with George Clooney and several others . On March 27 , 2012 , Moran introduced the AUTISM Educators Act that would implement a five-year pilot program allowing public schools to partner with colleges , universities , and non-profit organizations to promote teaching skills for educators working with high functioning students with autism . \u201c This legislation is the product of a grassroots effort by parents , instructors , school officials and caring communities , \u201d he said . \u201c Autism Spectrum Disorders are being diagnosed at an exploding rate . We have a responsibility to do everything in our power to provide the best education for our children . \u201d In 2012 , Moran was recognized as a \" Problem Solver \" by the bipartisan grassroots organization No Labels for \" continued willingness to work across the aisle and find common ground with members of the opposite party on important issues . His attitude is what Congress needs more of . Moran joined Virginia Reps. Gerry Connolly and Bobby Scott in asking Attorney General Eric Holder for a Department of Justice investigation into allegations of voter fraud in Virginia following charges that a contractor to the Republican Party of Virginia was caught discarding completed voter registration forms in a Harrisonburg , Virginia dumpster . Shortly thereafter , conservative activist James O 'Keefe released a video alleging involvement by Moran 's son in a voting fraud discussion ; see # Voter fraud allegations below .

He also supported gun control , voting for the Brady Bill and supporting a reinstatement of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban . At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions , though he reversed his positions on both issues . On education , he expressed support for the public education system , universal pre-kindergarten , and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program . Moran was given a 100 % rating by the NARAL and 0 % by the National Right to Life Committee , indicating a pro-choice voting record . He also voted to expand research of embryonic stem cells and to allow minors to go across state lines to receive abortions . On immigration , Moran supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and did not support decreasing the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country or the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local police . He was a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform ASAP Act of 2009 ( H.R.4321 ) , which the House did not pass . He was given an overall immigration reduction grade of D by NumbersUSA . The American Immigration Lawyers Association scored him as having voted 31 times for the organization 's position and 7 times against the organization 's position . In September 2009 , Moran was one of 75 members of the House of Representatives to vote no on a bill to eliminate any federal funds going to community organizer ACORN . = = = Federal employees = = = Moran introduced and supported legislation to increase benefits and pay for federal workers , in part due to the Federal Government \u2019 s large presence within the 8th District \u2013 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds . He introduced a bill signed into law that allows FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments , with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service . Moran also authored a law that allows a federal worker \u2019 s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity . In the 112th Congress , he also spoke against attempts by Republicans to cut back the size of the federal workforce . = = = Environment = = = Moran listed the environment as one of his top issues , citing his high marks from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club . He used his positions as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to allocate federal funding for hiking trails and wildlife reserves in his district . He also voted to ban logging on federal lands . He criticized the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) for inaction on climate change , saying that \" EPA had a historic opportunity to tackle head-on one of the greatest threats to our existence \u2014 global warming . Instead they balked under pressure from the administration , concluding the problem is so complex and controversial that it cannot be resolved . \" He also endorsed and voted for the Clean Air Act and said that global warming is an important issue to him . In 2010 , Moran also expressed discontent with President Barack Obama 's decision to allow oil drilling off the coast of the United States . = = = Economy , budget , and taxes = = = Moran often broke with his party on economic issues . For example , he supported Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) and other free trade agreements , harsher bankruptcy laws , and increased restrictions on the right to bring class action suits . He voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) Reform and Accountability Act . He supported pay-as-you-go budgeting and believed \" that the American government needs to strive to build up a surplus when possible , so that there are funds to support and sustain our country during tough financial times . \" Moran called former President George W. Bush \" Fiscally irresponsible . \" Moran said he supported the redistribution of wealth , saying in November 2008 that \" We have been guided by a Republican administration who believes in this simplistic notion that people who have wealth are entitled to keep it and they have an antipathy towards the means of redistributing wealth . \" He also said on his website that the recession was largely \" a result of the imbalance in the distribution of wealth over the last eight years and an absence of oversight and accountability . \" = = = Social programs = = = Moran called Social Security \" a safe , stable , and dependable source of financial assistance for retirees and their families , \" and strongly opposes privatizing Social Security , saying that it would \" cripple the system \" . It was his position that any changes to the current system must \" promote its long-term solvency without disrupting the core principles on which the program was founded . \" Moran expressed support for Universal Healthcare and more specifically the public health insurance option , saying at a town hall meeting in Reston , Virginia , in August 2009 that \" It could do the most to bring down long-term medical costs and to adequately insure every American . \" Moran ultimately voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , which passed and was signed into law in March 2010 . = = = Defense = = = Moran voted against authorizing the Iraq War in 2002 and did not support the troop increase for the Afghanistan War proposed by President Barack Obama in 2009 , saying first that he appreciated Obama 's \" careful consideration regarding the U.S. ' s engagement in Afghanistan \" , but later defining the issues on which he and the President disagreed : \" Our security concern is Al-Qaeda , not the Taliban . Eight years ago we went into Afghanistan to eliminate al-Qaeda and the \u201c safe haven \u201d that Afghanistan \u2019 s Taliban were providing the terrorist group responsible for the 9 / 11 attacks . Al-Qaeda has no significant presence today in all of Afghanistan .... Instead of increasing our troop presence , the U.S. should limit its mission in Afghanistan to securing strategic Afghan population centers with the troops currently on the ground . \" = = = = Comments prior to the invasion of Iraq = = = = Prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , Moran told an anti-war audience in Reston , Virginia , that if \" it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq , we would not be doing this . The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going , and I think they should \" . This brought criticism from many of his own party , including , among others , Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman . Nancy Pelosi , who was House Minority Leader at the time , remarked that \" Moran 's comments have no place in the Democratic Party . \" Moran apologized for the remarks , saying that \" I should not have singled out the Jewish community and regret giving any impression that its members are somehow responsible for the course of action being pursued by the administration , or are somehow behind an impending war ... What I was trying to say is that if more organizations in this country , including religious groups , were more outspoken against war , then I do not think we would be pursuing war as an option . \" = = = BRAC = = = Moran voted against BRAC 2005 which would move over 20,000 workers to Ft . Belvoir . The Army later decided to relocate approximately 6,400 Department of Defense workers to the Mark Center building in Alexandria . Moran opposed the selection of the Mark Center saying \u201c I 'm very disappointed ... It belonged at the Springfield site . \" Moran blocked federal funding for an HOV ramp directly to the Mark Center citing the impact upon Winkler Preserve . At Moran \u2019 s request , DoD ultimately delayed moving all workers to the Mark Center by one year . To help prevent gridlock , Moran got $ 20 million in short- and mid-term road improvements and a parking limit at the Mark Center of approximately 2,000 cars Moran also got $ 180 million to widen route 1 for the new Ft . Belvoir Hospital , an effort Sen. Webb called \u201c a tribute to Congressman Moran 's persistence . \u201d = = = Animal rights = = = Moran was in favor of stronger prohibitions against animal fighting . He sponsored legislation to penalize those who \" knowingly attend animal fights and allow minors to attend . \" He sponsored legislation limiting federal funding for horse slaughter inspection plants , effectively preventing the practice . In the past he promoted reinstating a five-year ban on slaughtering horses for food , noting that \" horses hold an important place in our nation 's history and culture ... they deserve to be cared for , not killed for foreign consumption . \" Moran in the past promoted safer keeping and treatment of exotic animals used in circus performances .

In January 1998 , one month before he introduced the legislation , credit card bank MBNA advocated that it would restrict the ability of consumer debtors to declare bankruptcy . Moran received a $ 447,000 debt consolidation loan at over 10 % interest rate . The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia at the time , Tim Kaine , joined Republican lawmakers in calling for a House Ethics Committee investigation into the loan , saying that Moran had made \" an error in judgment \" by accepting it . In his own defense , Moran said that the timing of the legislation 's introduction was coincidental and had nothing to do with the loan . MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said that the bank had offered the mortgage package not knowing that Moran was a member of Congress , and that the loan \" made good business sense \" because with the mortgage loan , \" we improved our position by getting security for an unsecured loan .... He had credit cards with us , he was having financial difficulties ; this put him in a better position to be able to pay us back from a cash-flow standpoint . \" = = = PMA group = = = The House Ethics Committee investigated several members of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , including Moran , Peter J.

Moran said that he was unaware of \" who made donations \" , and \" how much they gave \" , and therefore was not affected by the donations when allocating the funding . In February 2010 , the panel cleared Moran and the others , saying that they violated no laws . The panel concluded , as part of its 305-page report , that \" simply because a member sponsors an earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign contributor ... does not support a claim that a member 's actions are being influenced by campaign contributions \" . After PMA 's founder , Paul Magliocchetti , plead guilty in September 2010 to six years of campaign finance fraud , Moran said that he would not return the $ 177,700 in PMA Group-related donations that he received from 1990 to 2010 . = = = Insider trading = = = In November 2011 , author Peter Schweizer published a book , Throw Them All Out , which included an allegation that Moran used information he got from a September 16 , 2008 briefing , in which Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned of an impending financial crisis , for his stock market activity : \" September 17 , 2008 , was by far Moran \u2019 s most active trading day of the year . He dumped shares in Goldman Sachs , General Dynamics , Franklin Resources , Flowserve Corporation , Ecolabs , Edison International , Electronic Arts , DirecTV , Conoco , Procter & Gamble , AT & T , Apple , CVS , Cisco , Chubb , and a dozen more companies . \" Schweizer alleged that Moran made more than 90 trades that day . Moran defended himself by citing that the trades were made in the midst of the Great Recession and that all one had to do was turn on the television to see that stock prices were dropping fast . = = = Voter fraud allegations = = = On October 24 , 2012 a video was released showing Patrick B. Moran , the Congressman 's son and a field director with his father 's campaign , discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign . In response to the person 's suggestion about trying to cast votes in the names of 100 inactive voters , Patrick Moran attempted to discourage the scheme , but also discussed the practical difficulties of forging documentation such as utility bills . The person he was speaking with was actually a conservative activist with James O 'Keefe 's Project Veritas , and was secretly recording the conversation . Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign , saying he didn 't want to be a distraction during the election , and stating , \" at no point have I , or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior . At no point did I take this person seriously . He struck me as being unstable and joking , and for only that reason did I humor him . In hindsight , I should have immediately walked away , making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior , joking or not . \" The following day , the Arlington County Police Department opened a criminal probe into the matter . Two days after the video was released , the Virginia State Board of Elections asked Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli to investigate Moran 's campaign for voter fraud . On January 31 , 2013 , Arlington County announced that the investigation , by its police department in collaboration with the Offices of the Virginia Attorney General and the Arlington County Commonwealth \u2019 s Attorney , had concluded and that no charges would be brought . The County stated : \" Patrick Moran and the Jim Moran for Congress campaign provided full cooperation throughout the investigation . Despite repeated attempts to involve the party responsible for producing the video , they failed to provide any assistance . \" = = Later career = = In February 2015 , Moran joined McDermmott , Will , and Emery law firm in Washington , DC as a Senior Legislative Advisor . Virginia Tech announced in April 2016 that Moran had joined the School of Public and International Affairs as professor of practice . = = Electoral history = = = = Personal life = = Moran has been married at least twice . His second wife , Mary Howard Moran , filed for divorce in 1999 , one day after an argument at the couple 's Alexandria home which resulted in a visit by the police . The Congressman provided his own divorce papers a few months later , and in 2003 the couple officially separated . He remarried in 2004 to real estate developer LuAnn Bennett . In December 2010 , Moran and Bennett announced they were separating . Moran is the father of four children . One of his children is Patrick B. Moran , who once worked as a field director for his campaign , who resigned when allegations of voter fraud surfaced . Moran 's son , Patrick , later in 2012 , pleaded guilty to simple assault after being arrested after an incident with his girlfriend in front of a Columbia Heights bar on December 1 . He was sentenced to probation . Another one of his children is Dorothy , who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor during her father 's campaign for reelection against Kyle McSlarrow in 1994 . It was said at the time that she had only a twenty percent chance of living to age five , but after almost two years of chemotherapy and herbal therapies she was designated cancer free . His brother , Brian Moran , is a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates , and the head of the Virginia Democratic Party between early 2011 and December 2012 . He was an unsuccessful primary candidate for Governor of Virginia in the 2009 election .",

The keel for U-43 was laid down in August 1938 at Bremen ; she was launched in May 1939 and commissioned in August . Between November 1939 and July 1943 , the U-boat conducted 14 combat patrols , sinking 21 merchant ships for a total of 117,036 gross register tons ( GRT ) , damaging one ship of 10,350 GRT and another of 9,131 GRT - enough for it to be declared a total loss . U-43 was sunk on 30 July 1943 southwest of the Azores by a torpedo dropped by a United States Navy aircraft ; all 55 hands were lost . = = Construction = = U-43 was ordered for the Kriegsmarine on 21 November 1936 ( as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles ) . Her keel was laid down on 15 August 1938 by AG Weser , Bremen as yard number 946 .

The U-boat had a total length of 76.50 m ( 251 ft ) , a pressure hull length of 58.75 m ( 192 ft 9 in ) , a beam of 6.51 m ( 21 ft 4 in ) , a height of 9.40 m ( 30 ft 10 in ) , and a draught of 4.70 m ( 15 ft 5 in ) . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40 / 46 supercharged four-stroke , nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of 4,400 metric horsepower ( 3,240 kW ; 4,340 shp ) for use while surfaced , two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345 / 34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 1,000 metric horsepower ( 740 kW ; 990 shp ) for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two 1.92 m ( 6 ft ) propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres ( 750 ft ) . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 18.2 knots ( 33.7 km / h ; 20.9 mph ) and a maximum submerged speed of 7.7 knots ( 14.3 km / h ; 8.9 mph ) .

There , on 16 November , she attacked the 4,915 ton British merchant ship Arlington Court , a straggler from Convoy SL-7A , en route from Rosario , Argentina to Hull with a cargo of 7,340 tons of maize . The ship was hit by a single torpedo 320 nautical miles ( 590 km ; 370 mi ) west-south-west of Start Point in Devon . The crew abandoned ship , the U-boat fired another torpedo , which sank the ship within 30 minutes . Seven of the crew were lost , the survivors were picked up by Dutch and Norwegian freighters . After the attack , U-43 was hunted by convoy escorts for 20 hours , sustaining some damage from depth charges . Continuing with her patrol , U-43 attacked Convoy 14-BS in the Bay of Biscay , and sank the 4,374 ton French merchant ship Arijon on 22 November . Convoy escorts counter-attacked with 23 depth charges , but U-43 escaped without damage . Late on 25 November 1939 , about 120 nautical miles ( 220 km ; 140 mi ) west-north-west of Cape Finisterre ( northwest Spain ) , U-43 attacked the unescorted 2,483 ton British collier Uskmouth . Both G7a torpedoes malfunctioned ( a common problem in the early years of the war ) , so the U-boat opened fire with her deck gun . After a while she fired another torpedo , but missed , so recommenced shelling . After firing 149 rounds , U-43 left the ship on fire and slowly sinking . Two crewmen were killed , while 23 survivors were picked up by an Italian merchant ship . On the morning of 8 December U-43 was attacked by an unidentified aircraft and severely damaged . She returned to Wilhelmshaven six days later , on the 14th . = = = 2nd patrol = = = After the 6th U-boat Flotilla was disbanded in December 1939 , U-43 was assigned to the 2nd U-boat Flotilla based in Wilhelmshaven . U-43 departed from there on 13 March 1940 and sailed along the coast of Norway , north of Scotland , and into the waters west of Ireland , but had no success . The First Watch Officer ( second-in-command of the U-boat ) Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Wilhelm Behrens fell overboard and was lost on 31 March . U-43 returned to Wilhelmshaven , after 25 days at sea , on 6 April . = = = 3rd patrol = = = U-43 's third voyage began on 12 April 1940 .

She returned to Wilhelmshaven the next day . = = = 4th patrol = = = U-43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 13 May 1940 and out into the Atlantic . Her first attack took place on 28 May , south-west of Land 's End , when she fired a torpedo at the British merchant ship Alca . She missed , and then opened fire with her deck gun . The armed ship returned fire , but neither vessel made any hits ; the U-boat broke off the attack . U-43 finally found success on 21 June when she attacked Convoy 65-X south-west of Figueira da Foz , Portugal , hitting the 8,627 ton British tanker Yarraville with a single torpedo . The ship caught fire and sank . Five crew members were killed , the 45 survivors were picked up by a French trawler . Late on 30 June U-43 hit the 13,376 ton British merchant ship SS Avelona Star with a single torpedo 220 nautical miles ( 410 km ; 250 mi ) northwest of Cape Finisterre . The ship , part of Convoy SL-36 , was en route from Buenos Aires to London with a cargo of 5,630 tons of frozen meat and 1,000 tons of oranges . The crew abandoned the ship , which foundered the next day . One crewman was killed in the attack , the 84 survivors were picked up by the British merchant ship Beignon , which was subsequently torpedoed and sunk by U-30 on 1 July . Three survivors from Avelona Star were killed . On the evening of 9 July U-43 sank the unescorted 3,944 ton British merchant ship Aylesbury about 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) southeast of Ireland . Hit by two torpedoes , the ship sank in 15 minutes . All 35 crew survived . U-43 's fourth and final success on her fourth patrol took place on the morning of 17 July when she sank the 3,509-ton British merchant ship Fellside , a straggler from convoy OA-184 , about 135 nautical miles ( 250 km ; 155 mi ) north-west of Bloody Foreland ( Cnoc Fola ) , Donegal . The U-boat 's first torpedo passed under the vessel , but the second struck the ship and caused her to sink within five minutes . Twelve of the crew were killed , 21 survivors were rescued . U-43 arrived back at Wilhelmshaven on 22 July after 71 days at sea . = = = 5th patrol = = = U-43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 9 September 1940 , stopping at Bergen , Norway for three days before sailing on the 15th for another Atlantic patrol . She sank only one ship , the 5,802 ton British merchantman Sulairia , separated from Convoy OB-217 , on 25 September . The U-boat hit the ship with a single torpedo causing her to sink 356 nautical miles ( 659 km ; 410 mi ) west of Achill Head , County Mayo . One man was lost , the remaining 56 crewmen were picked up by HMCS Ottawa . U-43 then made for her new home port at Lorient in France , where the 2nd U-boat Flotilla had relocated in June after the fall of that country , arriving there on 18 October . Her commander , Wilhelm Ambrosius , was promoted to Korvettenkapit\u00e4n on 1 November , and left U-43 , going on to take command of the 22nd U-boat Flotilla in January 1941 . Command of the U-boat passed to Oberleutnant zur See Wolfgang L\u00fcth , who would go on to become the second most successful German submarine commander of the war . = = = 6th patrol = = = Under her new captain , U-43 left Lorient on 10 November 1940 and returned to the waters west of Ireland , where she sank three more merchant ships and damaged a fourth . On the morning of 2 December she attacked Convoy OB-251 west-south-west of Rockall and sank two ships . Her first victim was the 7,113 ton British merchant ship Pacific President , which was hit by two torpedoes and quickly sank with the loss of her crew of 50 men . Forty-five minutes later U-43 hit the 12,247 ton British oil tanker Victor Ross with two torpedoes . A third torpedo was fired five minutes later , but missed , the U-boat evaded a ramming attempt by crash-diving shortly afterwards . However , she persisted and hit the ship with a fourth torpedo 20 minutes later , sinking her . There were no survivors from her 44 crew . In the evening of 6 December , U-43 spotted a ship and pursued her for three and a half hours before firing a single torpedo , which missed . The U-boat fired another torpedo 20 minutes later , hitting the unknown ship and sinking her in 63 seconds . The vessel is believed to be the 1,902 ton Norwegian merchant ship Skrim , which had lost contact with Convoy OB-252 two days before in heavy weather and was never seen again . Finally , on 13 December , U-43 fired two torpedoes at the unescorted 10,350 ton British merchant ship Orari about 450 nautical miles ( 830 km ; 520 mi ) southwest of Ireland . One torpedo hit the ship in the stern . However , U-43 had no torpedoes left , and the sea was too rough for her to use her deck gun . The crew of the ship managed to plug the hole with tarpaulins , and the ship made it under her own power to the Clyde . U-43 returned to Lorient on 17 December 1940 after a patrol of 38 days . On 4 February 1941 , while at Lorient docks , U-43 was sunk after a valve was accidentally left open , putting the U-boat out of action for the next three months . = = = 7th patrol = = = After this enforced absence U-43 began her next patrol on 11 May 1941 , still under the command of Wolfgang L\u00fcth , who had been promoted to Kapit\u00e4nleutnant on 1 January . Once again she sailed out into the mid-Atlantic , where she sank three ships . Early on the morning of 15 May U-43 opened fire with her deck gun and anti-aircraft guns on the 488 ton French three-masted sailing ship Notre Dame du Ch\u00e2telet , en route from St. Malo to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to fish . After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank . L\u00fcth suspected that the vessel was reporting the positions of U-boats to Allied forces , while the 10 survivors thought they had been attacked by a British submarine . They , from her crew of 38 , abandoned ship in two lifeboats . Two were picked up by the Italian submarine Otaria on 23 May . On the evening of 6 June U-43 put two torpedoes into the 4,802 ton Dutch merchant ship Yselhaven about 600 nautical miles ( 1,100 km ; 690 mi ) east of Newfoundland . The ship , separated from Convoy OB-328 , sank within two minutes . Only 10 of her crew of 34 survived to be rescued by the Finnish merchantman Hammarland on 15 June . In the early hours of 17 June , U-43 torpedoed and sank the 2,727 ton British merchant ship Cathrine , part of Convoy SL-76 , which was loaded with 3,700 tons of manganese ore , about 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ; 290 mi ) south-west of Cape Clear ( southern Ireland ) . Only three men survived from her crew of 27 ; they spent 33 days in a lifeboat before being found by a British trawler . U-43 returned to Lorient on 1 July after a patrol lasting 52 days . = = = 8th and 9th patrols = = = U-43 's next patrol , beginning on 2 August 1941 , took her back out into the mid-Atlantic for 53 days , but she had no success before returning to Lorient on 23 September . U-43 went to sea again on 10 November 1941 , this time she was more successful , sinking three ships near the Azores . Early on the morning of 29 November , U-43 fired two torpedoes at the 5,569 ton British merchant ship Thornliebank , part of Convoy OS-12 , and loaded with general cargo and munitions , about 240 nautical miles ( 440 km ; 280 mi ) north-north-west of the Azores . Both torpedoes struck the ship , which exploded violently . There were no survivors from the crew of 75 men . Despite being about 1,200 metres ( 0.75 mi ) distant , debris from the explosion struck the surfaced U-boat , slightly injuring a crewman ; the next day an unfuzed 10 cm ( 3.9 in ) shell was found lodged in the conning tower . On the evening of 30 November , the 4,868-ton British merchant ship Ashby , a straggler from Convoy OS-12 , was hit by one of two torpedoes fired by U-43 , 170 nautical miles ( 310 km ; 200 mi ) south-south-east of Flores in the Azores . The ship sank within four minutes with the loss of 17 of her crew of 50 . The survivors were picked up by the Portuguese destroyer Lima . After the attack the U-boat was depth charged for several hours by convoy escorts , but managed to escape unharmed . At about 17 : 00 on 1 December 1941 , U-43 and U-575 spotted the 7,542 ton unescorted and unarmed tanker Astral . Both U-boats gave chase , but after four hours U-575 , commanded by Kapit\u00e4nleutnant G\u00fcnther Heydemann , observed the large American flag painted on her side and abandoned the pursuit . U-43 continued to follow the neutral ship , firing a torpedo at her around midnight , which missed . The ship immediately began to sail a zigzag evasive course at full speed , but the U-boat had no problem following her in the light of the full moon . The next morning U-43 hit the Astral with two torpedoes . The ship , loaded with 78,200 barrels ( 12,430 m3 ) of gasoline and kerosene , exploded and sank within minutes . There were no survivors from her crew of 37 . The Astral was the third of four American merchant ships sunk by U-boats prior to America 's entry into the war . U-43 returned to Lorient on 16 December . = = = 10th patrol = = = L\u00fcth 's last patrol with the boat began on 30 December 1941 , when U-43 sailed from Lorient into the mid-Atlantic , where she sank three more ships . The first was the 5,246 ton Swedish cargo ship Yngaren , straggling from convoy HX-168 due to bad weather , about 600 nautical miles ( 1,100 km ; 690 mi ) west of Ireland . On the morning of 12 January 1942 the ship was hit by two torpedoes and sank within a minute . Six British passengers and 32 crewmen were lost , the only two survivors were spotted on a raft on 10 February by a British patrol aircraft , which directed a fishing trawler to their position the next day . Early in the morning of 14 January , U-43 attacked Convoy ON-55 south of Iceland and sank the 6,641 ton British merchant ship Empire Surf . Only six of the crew of 53 survived to be picked up by HMS Alisma . About two hours later U-43 attacked the convoy again and sank the 5,707 ton Panama-registered American merchant ship Chepo . There were 21 survivors from her 38 crew . The U-boat then sailed to Kiel , arriving on 22 January . Command of the U-boat passed to her 1.WO , Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Joachim Schwantke , as L\u00fcth left to commission U-181 . = = = 11th patrol = = = U-43 's first patrol under her new commander began on 4 July 1942 , as she sailed from Kiel via the ' gap ' between Iceland and the Faroe Islands into the mid-Atlantic .

On the morning of 18 November , U-43 fired four torpedoes at Convoy SC-109 and hit the 9,131 ton American tanker Brilliant , loaded with 90,704 barrels ( 14,420.8 m3 ) of fuel oil . A 40-foot ( 12 m ) diameter hole was made in her side , and the cargo caught fire . While some of the crew abandoned ship , those remaining aboard managed to put the fires out ; making only three knots , the ship limped the 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ; 350 mi ) to Bonavista Bay , Newfoundland , arriving on 24 November . Brilliant eventually left Newfoundland on 18 January 1943 under tow , but after two days the ship broke in half . The fore section sank immediately , while the aft section drifted for some days before it was found and the 44 crew rescued . The aft section was taken in tow , but sank the next day . U-43 arrived back at Lorient on 9 December after a patrol of 78 days . = = = 13th patrol = = = U-43 's first patrol of 1943 began on 9 January , patrolling the waters between the Azores and the West African coast .

Only later did U-43 learn that it was the 5,154 ton German blockade runner Doggerbank , formerly the British Speybank that had been captured by the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis in January 1941 . The ship was carrying 7,000 tons of rubber , fats , fish oil , and other raw materials from Yokohama to France ; she was several days ahead of her scheduled arrival date . U-43 returned to Lorient on 31 March after 82 days at sea . = = = 14th patrol = = = U-43 's final patrol began when she sailed from Lorient on 13 July 1943 and headed southwest into the Atlantic . On the evening of 19 July , in company with U-403 in the Bay of Biscay , the two U-boats were attacked by a British Liberator Mk.V bomber of No. 86 Squadron RAF . U-403 crash-dived immediately , covered by the AA fire of U-43 , which then dived . The Liberator was slightly damaged and a crewman wounded , but dropped two homing torpedoes .

Formed in June 1940 , the battalion was assigned to the 22nd Brigade , which formed part of the Australian 8th Division . After completing basic training , the 2 / 18th was sent to Singapore and Malaya to strengthen the defences of the British colonies in February 1941 against a possible Japanese attack . The 2 / 18th Battalion subsequently undertook garrison duties throughout the year at various locations in Malaya , where it conducted jungle training and constructed defences along the eastern coast . Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific in December 1941 , the 2 / 18th saw action against Japanese forces in the Malayan campaign , during which they took part in a large-scale ambush of a Japanese force on the Malay Peninsula before joining the withdrawal to Singapore in early 1942 . Assigned to defend part of the north-west coast of the island , the battalion participated in the unsuccessful defence of Singapore in early February 1942 . Following the fall of Singapore the majority of the battalion 's personnel were taken as prisoners of war . Many of these men died in captivity ; the survivors were liberated in 1945 and returned to Australia where the battalion was disbanded . = = History = = = = = Formation = = = The 2 / 18th Battalion was raised around Sydney , New South Wales , in June 1940 , with its first subunits being formed on 13 July at Wallgrove Camp . Formed as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) from volunteers for overseas service , the battalion 's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Varley , a grazier from Inverell , New South Wales , and a World War I veteran who had previously commanded the 35th Battalion while serving in the Militia during the interwar years . The battalion concentrated at Wallgrove on 15 July , and a cadre of commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers ( NCOs ) who were selected from the Militia \u2014 in many cases personally by Varley \u2014 was established , while the remainder of the battalion 's NCOs were appointed from recruits following their arrival . The majority of the battalion 's personnel arrived on 27 and 28 July . Coming from across the state of New South Wales , the men were drawn from places such as Tamworth , Newcastle , Wagga , Goulburn , and Liverpool , with roughly 60 percent coming from rural backgrounds . With an authorised strength of around 900 men , the battalion was organised around a battalion headquarters , with a regimental aid post , four rifle companies and a headquarters company consisting of various support platoons and sections including signals , mortars , transport ( later carriers ) , pioneers , anti-aircraft and administration . Along with the 2 / 19th and 2 / 20th Battalions , it was assigned to the 22nd Brigade , which formed part of the 8th Division . The colours chosen for the battalion 's Unit Colour Patch ( UCP ) were the same as those of the 18th Battalion , a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921 . These colours were purple over green , in a diamond shape , although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart ; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division . Basic training began at Wallgrove on 1 August , and was provided by experienced regular soldiers and personnel who had previously served in the Militia . In mid-August the battalion moved to Ingleburn , and by the end of the month individual training had been completed . Collective training followed , and on 5 October the battalion took part in a divisional march through Sydney . A further move came in November when the 2 / 18th was transported to Bathurst , where more complex exercises were undertaken , including at brigade and divisional levels . Although the fighting had not yet spread to the Pacific , by late 1940 there were growing concerns amongst the Allies about the possibility of a war with Japan . After a review of the defences around Singapore and Malaya , the British government requested Australian troops be sent to garrison the region . In October , the Australian government committed the 22nd Brigade and supporting elements . As a result , the 2 / 18th \u2014 with a strength of 793 men \u2014 subsequently embarked upon the RMS Queen Mary and left Sydney on 4 February 1941 , bound for Singapore . The Australian government wished to send the brigade to the Middle East to join the 6th , 7th and 9th Divisions , so the deployment was only intended to be short , as the British government pledged to release an Indian division to replace the Australians in May . Consequently , the Australian forces were deployed having only been partially trained and equipped and while they were still in the process of being brought up to full strength . = = = Malayan campaign = = = The men arrived in Singapore on 18 February 1941 and moved into barracks at Port Dickson , in the north of Malaya . While there , the battalion undertook further training to prepare it for jungle warfare , before moving to Seremban in March . Further drafts of reinforcements arrived during this time as the battalion was brought up to its wartime establishment . The rigours of jungle training and the tropical heat had an impact on the men , and a number of personnel were hospitalised during this time with illnesses such as malaria , measles , mumps and serious tropical skin diseases . Some of these were repatriated back to Australia , and by the end of March , the 2 / 18th was still below its authorised establishment , with an actual strength of 898 . Amidst growing concerns amongst Australian military commanders about Japanese intentions , the scheduled replacement of the 22nd Brigade was cancelled , and the 2 / 18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August . The following month they were sent north to Mersing , which , situated on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula , was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a short route of advance towards Singapore . At Mersing , the battalion was set to work digging defensive positions and constructing wire obstacles , punctuated by familiarisation patrols and anti-aircraft , anti-gas and mortar training . The battalion was placed on a war footing on 6 December as tensions in the region escalated . Two days later , the Japanese invasion of Malaya commenced ; while the fighting raged elsewhere , the 2 / 18th remained unengaged around Mersing . On 26 December , a small group of 2 / 18th men were detached to an ad hoc British raiding force known as \" Roseforce \" to take part in a raid behind Japanese lines , ambushing a Japanese convoy . It was not until 3 January however that the battalion came into contact with the Japanese for the first time , with a patrol from the 2 / 18th capturing two Japanese airmen who had been shot down near the mouth of the Sekakap River . A fortnight later , Japanese advances along the peninsula to the west led to concerns about the coastal defences being outflanked and cut off . As result , on 17 January , the 2 / 18th was ordered to withdraw south 10 miles ( 16 km ) to Jemaluang without having met the Japanese in battle . Following a landing around Mersing , the Japanese began to advance south towards Jemaluang in large numbers . In response , on 26 January the 2 / 18th Battalion , supported by two batteries of artillery from the 2 / 10th Field Regiment , was tasked with establishing an ambush near the Nithsdale Estate and the rubber plantation at Joo Lye . Establishing themselves along the Mersing \u2013 Jemaluang road , ' D ' Company was deployed to the north on the western side of the road as the lookout force , while ' B ' Company was positioned further to the south on the opposite side of the road . South of them , ' A ' Company formed the blocking force , with their position stretched across the road oriented to the north . Behind them , ' C ' Company was positioned in reserve , further south . The plan had been for the ambush to be sprung during the day , but the Japanese advance had proceeded more slowly than thought , and it was not until after dark that they entered the ambush site . In order to inflict as many casualties as possible , the Japanese force , which was estimated to be battalion-sized , was allowed to pass through ' D ' and ' B ' Companies . By 3 : 00 am they came up against ' A ' Company 's blocking position and the ambush was finally initiated . Devastating indirect fire from artillery and mortars inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese ; however , as the northernmost company \u2014 ' D ' \u2014 turned south to attack the Japanese from the rear , they came up against determined resistance from a force of Japanese that had managed to infiltrate the ambush site and dig in on a small feature to the east of the estate 's pig farm , north of ' B ' Company . This effectively cut them off from the rest of the battalion . Fighting raged throughout the early morning as ' B ' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut-off ' D ' Company . Varley decided to launch a counterattack with ' A ' Company , but at 8 : 00 am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters , cancelling the attack . Covered by the reserve company , ' A ' and some of ' B ' Company were able to break contact and fall back . ' D ' Company , along with those of ' B ' Company that were still isolated and in contact , had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion 's lines . By the time they arrived , there were only enough men left to form one platoon . The 2 / 18th 's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed , wounded or missing . Japanese losses are unknown , but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days . = = = Fighting in Singapore = = = After the withdrawal from Nithsdale , the battalion fell back along the Jemaluang \u2013 Kota Tinggi Road , before helping to cover the Allied withdrawal over the Johor \u2013 Singapore Causeway to Singapore Island . No engagements were fought during this phase , but the 2 / 18th patrolled constantly and provided rearguard detachments . During this time , the battalion was briefly commanded by Major William Fraser , when Varley temporarily took over Eastforce , which consisted of the 22nd Brigade and a number of Indian and Malay formations , filling in for Brigadier Harold Burfield Taylor , who was temporarily detached to organise a force to cover the withdrawal . Following its arrival on the island , Varley returned to the battalion , which received a small number of reinforcements \u2014 about 90 men \u2014 and was allocated to the defence of the Western Area along with the rest of the 8th Division . Forming part of the 22nd Brigade 's defensive line in the north-west sector , stretching from the Causeway to the Sungei Berih , the battalion was responsible for defending a frontage of 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) . With a strength of 37 officers and 826 other ranks , the battalion occupied a position in the centre of the brigade that stretched from the 2 / 20th 's position around Kranji to the 2 / 19th 's around Sungei Sarimbun , north-east of the village of Ama Keng and Tengah Airfield . Consisting of \" tidal mud flats and mangrove swamps intersected with streams and inlets \" , there had been no work done to prepare the area that the battalion was allocated to defend prior to its arrival due to political concerns about alarming the local population . The wide frontage stretched the 2 / 18th thin on the ground , with no depth and large gaps between positions that were separated in places by tidal waterways . Due to the thick vegetation along the shoreline , the battalion 's positions had the added handicap of poor visibility of the water and limited fields of fire that , combined with their isolation , meant that they were unable to support each other . After occupying their positions on 1 February , the battalion worked to improve them as best they could , working under the cover of darkness so as to avoid Japanese artillery and air attacks . The Japanese attack on the north-west coast came on the night of 8 / 9 February , beginning with a heavy artillery and aerial bombardment of the 22nd Brigade 's positions throughout the day , followed by a waterborne assault across the Johore Strait , which began around 10 : 30 pm . Confronted by 16 battalions from the Japanese 5th and 18th Divisions , which concentrated upon the 2 / 18th 's and 2 / 20th 's positions , the 2 / 18th 's two forward companies \u2014 ' A ' and ' C ' \u2014 strongly resisted two frontal assaults during the day . Heavy casualties were inflicted on the Japanese over the course of several hours , but the defenders were eventually forced back by heavy indirect fire and overwhelming numbers . Exploiting the holes in the battalion 's perimeter to avoid resistance , by 1 : 30 am on 9 February the Japanese had penetrated towards battalion headquarters near the Lim Chau Kang road , threatening to roll up the battalion 's rear . Varley then ordered the forward companies to make a fighting withdrawal and fall back on battalion headquarters . Heavy fighting followed , during which the Australians suffered grave losses as groups became lost in the darkness in the thick country , before the battalion was able to re-establish itself around Ama Keng . The 2 / 18th attempted to defend the Tengah Airfield , but by 1 : 00 pm in the afternoon of 9 February they had been reduced to only 330 men and were withdrawn back to the south-east of the airfield , occupying a position around Bulim along the Chu Kang Road , with the 2 / 29th Battalion on their left . Throughout the night of 9 / 10 February , minor clashes occurred as patrols were sent out to fend off Japanese probes . The battalion continued to hold the line until 6 : 00 am when , following receipt of orders to withdraw , it moved back to Keat Hong village to take up the role of brigade reserve . The carrier platoon covered the battalion 's withdrawal , and amidst heavy artillery shelling , they ambushed two Japanese columns , each roughly company-sized , inflicting heavy casualties upon them with their Vickers machine-guns before breaking contact . As a result of a misinterpretation of orders , the 22nd Brigade fell back towards Reformatory Road where the 2 / 18th took up positions to the west between the junctions of the Ulu Pandan and Bukit Timah Roads . When the brigade launched a counterattack later that day , the majority of the battalion was held back in reserve , after suffering many casualties . A single company , though , was detached at this time to an ad hoc formation dubbed \" X Battalion \" , tasked with launching a counterattack . Meanwhile , the rest of the battalion moved back into the reserve position along the Bukit Panjang Road . That evening the 2 / 18th occupied a position north of a feature dubbed \" 127 \" , but early on the morning of 11 February they were moved back south of there to gain better fields of fire . Shortly after this , the 2 / 18th came under attack from front and rear after the Japanese managed to infiltrate behind their position , forcing the 2 / 18th to fall back further under the cover of the fire from the carriers once again . Later during 11 February , the 22nd Brigade headquarters , situated around Wai Soon Gardens , came under attack from a Japanese force moving south from Bukit Timah . In response , the 2 / 18th launched a counterattack across Reformatory Road with bayonets . At the same time , a section from the battalion 's carrier platoon , under the command of Lieutenant Iven John Mackay , son of Lieutenant General Iven Giffard Mackay , conducted a daring attack that stopped the Japanese advance . Rolling up the axis of the road , firing machine-guns and hurling grenades , they advanced to the Bukit Timah Road before heading south to Holland Road and then returning to battalion headquarters . After this , the 22nd Brigade moved back towards the junction of Holland and Ulu Padan Roads . Moving while under heavy fire , the battalion established itself in its new position before 9 : 00 am , but in the confusion of the move , some men found themselves separated from the main body and cut off . In the afternoon , after the brigade position was reoriented to the west , the battalion was placed in reserve . The battalion 's positions in the north , situated on the high ground , experienced heavy attack from Japanese aircraft and artillery , as the brigade \u2014 supported by Australian and British artillery \u2014 fought off two regiments from the Japanese 18th Division during the course of the night of 11 / 12 February . Early the following morning , Varley was promoted to brigadier and took over as commander of the 22nd Brigade from Taylor , who was taken ill . In Varley 's place , Major Charles O 'Brien , who had previously been the battalion second-in-command , took over command of the battalion . After a brief lull in the fighting in the 22nd Brigade 's sector , the Japanese 18th Division attacked again , attempting to take the brigade on its left flank . In response , the 2 / 18th was sent to retake some of the high ground south-east of the Ulu Pandan and Reformatory Roads late in the afternoon . Attacking with about 60 men , supported by three British armoured cars and artillery fire , they were unable to retake the position after the light failed . The Japanese then pressed heavily against the 22nd Brigade 's position , and they were forced to give ground , falling back to the junction of Buona Vista and Holland Roads , by which time the 2 / 18th was down to only 250 men . On 13 February , in an attempt to gain room for a possible counterattack , the Allied commander , Lieutenant General Arthur Percival , ordered a shortening of the Allied lines towards the south-east and the formation of a 25-mile ( 40 km ) perimeter around Singapore city . As a part of this , the Australian forces were concentrated into a 7-mile ( 11 km ) perimeter centred around Farrer and Holland Roads , about 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) west of the city , tasked with defending the north-east sector of the defensive line . The 2 / 18th was positioned among the gravestones of Cemetery Hill , and apart from a few minor skirmishes and overflights by Japanese aircraft spotting for artillery , a period of respite followed in the Australian sector . The Japanese skirted the position , moving in an easterly direction towards the city , by way of gaps in the line which opened to the north and south of the Australians through positions held by British , Indian and Malay units . The Japanese continued to advance into the outskirts of Singapore throughout 14 February . Threatened with being isolated , the Australians made plans to make a last stand . With the Japanese closing in , the island 's civilian population began to suffer heavily as they were subjected to heavy artillery bombardment and aerial attacks from Japanese aircraft that were increasingly unopposed as anti-aircraft guns ran out of ammunition . Supplies of water and food also dwindled , and the water shortage was made worse by the loss of the island 's reservoirs . Finally , in the morning of 15 February , after the Japanese had succeeded in infiltrating towards Mount Pleasant Ridge , Percival determined that a counterattack was not viable and instead decided to surrender the garrison . The battalion 's final involvement in the fighting came that afternoon when ' A ' and ' D ' Companies were heavily shelled . A short time later , at 8 : 30 pm , the surrender came into effect and the men of the 2 / 18th received orders not to escape . = = = Prisoners of War = = = While the majority of the 2 / 18th obeyed the order not to escape following the surrender , a small number of men attempted to evade capture . Along with other members of the battalion who had found themselves cut off from the rest of the battalion earlier in the fighting , they attempted to make their way back to Allied lines via Sumatra . There , some were eventually captured , while others managed to get away to Ceylon . Of these , 24 eventually managed to return to Australia , some of whom were transferred to other units and later took part in further fighting in New Guinea . When the Japanese arrived to effect the capture of the 2 / 18th , six men from the carrier platoon , which had earlier inflicted heavy casualties upon the Japanese during the fighting , were ordered to move the battalion 's carriers , before being tied up and executed . Four other 2 / 18th soldiers were killed in the massacre at the Alexandra Hospital . The surviving members of the battalion were then marched 25 miles ( 40 km ) to the prisoner of war camp at Changi . Shortly afterwards , the men were split up and sent to various locations to serve as forced labourers . The majority of the 2 / 18th 's personnel were sent to Blakang Mati , but some remained in Changi , while others were sent to Japan or were sent to work on the Thai \u2013 Burma Railway . A total of 174 men were sent to Borneo where in 1945 they were subjected to the Sandakan Death Marches , which only about ten percent of the 2 / 18th men survived . Despite being separated , though , wherever possible the 2 / 18th men sought to stay together in their groups and the battalion structure was maintained even in captivity . The battalion 's first commanding officer , Varley , was one of those sent to Burma where , as senior Allied officer , he worked to secure the welfare of over 9,000 men working on the railway , including many from the 2 / 18th . He was later sent to Thailand before being brought back to Singapore once work was completed . In late 1944 he was transferred to Formosa . On 12 September , while en route , the transport ship \u2014 Rakuyo Maru \u2014 that he and around 1,250 other prisoners were on , was torpedoed by a US submarine , USS Sealion . Varley took charge of several lifeboats of prisoners during the evacuation , attempting to lead them to safety . They were never seen again and are believed to have been machine-gunned several days later by Japanese frigates that were in the area . During their time in captivity , men from the 2 / 18th undertook a number of subversive activities including building a radio transmitter , which they used to contact local resistance groups who provided them with assistance in the form of medicine and intelligence . They were also involved in numerous escape attempts , some of which were successful , alongside Australians from other units . One of these successful escapes involved a group of eight men who escaped from the camp on Berhala Island in two groups . One group escaped while out of camp on a work detail , while the other simply walked out the front gate to use the ablutions and never came back . After meeting up outside the camp , the men split up again . One group included Lieutenant Charles Wagner , who had previously been decorated with the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions around the Nithsdale Estate and who had been commissioned in the field . Having bribed one of the camp guards , Wagner 's group had contacted the local guerillas and arranged to rendezvous with a fishing vessel . After hiding out for three weeks , the vessel eventually arrived offshore and took them on board . The group then met up with the other escapees on Tawi-Tawi where in mid-1943 they began working with the Filipino guerilla forces , fighting alongside them until the end of the war . Other escapes occurred later in the war , including one in which five men escaped from Ranau over the course of two days in early July 1945 during one of the death marches . After effecting their escape , these men were helped by locals who provided food and information , before the men were able to meet up with some Australians from Z Special Unit . Following the end of the war in August 1945 , the men that survived as prisoners of war were repatriated to Australia . Returning by aircraft and ship , this was largely completed by October , and later that year the battalion was officially disbanded . A total of 1,323 men served in the battalion throughout its existence , including reinforcements and personnel that were transferred . The battalion 's battle casualties amounted to 80 killed and 10 wounded in Malaya , as well as 175 killed and 238 wounded in Singapore . On top of this 225 men from the 2 / 18th died in captivity as prisoners of war . For their involvement in the war , members of the battalion received the following decorations : one Military Cross , two Distinguished Conduct Medals , one Military Medal , two Members of the Order of the British Empire , and 11 Mentions in Despatches . = = Battle honours = = The 2 / 18th Battalion received the following battle honours : Malaya 1941 \u2013 1942 , Johore , Jemaluang , and Singapore Island . = = Commanding officers = = The following officers served as commanding officer of the 2 / 18th : Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Varley ; Major William Fraser ; and Major Charles O 'Brien .",

                    "text": "Spencer ( surname ) = Spencer ( also Spence , Spender , Spens , and Spenser ) is a surname . The origin can be traced directly to Robert d 'Abbetot , who is listed as Robert le Dispenser , a tenant-in-chief of several counties , in the Domesday Book of 1086 . Robert was possibly one of the Norman knights who fought alongside ( or accompanied ) William the Conqueror in the defeat of Harold II , King of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . There is little doubt that both Robert and his brother Urse came to England at about the time of the Battle of Hastings . They were both beneficiaries of William over the years , and were given titles and substantial land and property \u2014 suggesting repayment for some earlier deeds . It is likely that Robert 's first acknowledgment was his official appointment as Royal \" Dispencier \" sometimes expressed more grandly as \" Royal Steward \" , \" King 's Steward \" or \" Lord Steward \" . As dispenser of provisions to the King and his household Robert was known and recorded as Robert le Despencer or , in its Latinised form , Robertus Dispensator . There is also the possibility that Robert held this official position before arriving in England . Robert 's adopted surname was usually written as Despenser or Dispenser \u2014 notably in works such as the Domesday Book of 1086 and the Scottish Ragman Rolls of 1291 and 1296 . From 1066 until the 13th century the occupational name attributed to Robert d 'Abbetot existed with numerous spelling and other variations . Eventually both the \" le \" and \" de \" that frequently preceded the name were omitted . In 1392 the popular \" s \" in the centre of the name was discarded and replaced with the \" c \" seen in the present-day form \u2014 Spencer . The surname Spencer has gained in popularity over time . In the 19th century it also become popular as a given name \u2014 especially in the more anglicised areas of the United States . = = Variations = = = = = English = = = In its transition from the French dispencier to its current form , the name Spencer has been presented and spelled in many ways \u2014 especially through the period of its early evolution in the medieval period from c.1100 to 1350 AD . The following ( in alphabetical order ) is a selection of the many orthographic variants : Despencer , de Expansa ( derived from expence ) , De Spencer , de Spendure , de Spens , de la Despense , De la Spence , de la Spense , del Spens , Despenser , DeSpenser , Dispencer , Dispenser , Despensator , Dispensator , la Spens , le Despencer , le Despendur , le Despencer , le Despenser , le dispencer , le Espencer , le Espenser , le Spencer , le Spendur , Spendure , le Spenser , le Spensier , Spence , Spences , Spen , Spender , Spens , Spensar , Spense , Spenser , Spensers , Spensor , Spincer , also the rare patronymic Spencers , and the aphetic ( derived ) Spender . Within a few generations the le ( \" the \" ) usually placed before Despenser was omitted . The name variant Spens first appears as Simon del Spens , dated 1300 , in the \" Charters of Gisburn Priory \" , Yorkshire , England , during the reign of Edward I. Spence , another form of Spens , means both \" the place where provisions are kept \" and the \" clerk of the kitchen \" . This form of the name was popular in both the north of England and in Scotland . In Fife the word referred to \" a spare room beside the kitchen \" , and in England to a \" yard , enclosure or buttery \" \u2014 simply an abbreviation of despencer referring to the household store . The principal Scottish family of Clan Spens descend from one of the ancient Earls of Fife . John \" Dispensator or Le Dispenser \" appeared in a list of the tenants and vassals of Walter fitz Alan High Steward of Scotland in the period 1161 \u2013 1171 . Roger ' Dispensator ' witnessed a charter by Bricius de Douglas , the bishop of Moray granting the church of Deveth to Spynie between 1202 and 1222 . The family de Spens in Fife trace their ancestry back to 1170 and the \" Baron de Spens d 'Estignols \" , who settled in France in 1450 , and \" the Count de Spens , who ranked among the first of the Swedish nobility and was generalissimo of the Swedish forces \" . As a north country word for ' pantry ' , spence was used by Poet Laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson in the sense of a refectory : \" Bluff Harry broke into the spence and turn 'd the cowls adrift \" ( The Talking Oak , l.47. ) . The surnames Stewart and Stuart denote essentially the same occupation but have a completely different word derivation . They originate from the pre-7th-century English words stigweard \u2014 a compound of stig meaning household \u2014 and weard , a guardian . = = = Other countries and cultures = = = Foreign Equivalents : German : Speiser \u2013 a steward . This is a derivative of the Middle High German spise , meaning food or supplies via the Old High German \u2014 in turn derived from Late Latin expe ( n ) sa ( pecunia ) , or \" ( money ) expended \" . Jewish ( Ashkenazic ) : Speiser \u2013 occupational name for a grocer , from a later semantic development of \" Speiser \" . Greek : Economos \u2013 the anglicised surname derived from the Greek oikonomou ( \" oi \" in Greek pronounced as a long E. ) Oikon ( English = \u0113con ) means house in classical Greek . This surname has the same occupational derivation as Spencer but , like the surnames Stewart and Stuart , has a different etymology . The original meaning of oikonomou was a home owner but it evolved to mean estate manager , somebody who was responsible for all resources on the estate , a steward . Oikonomou was a medieval Eastern Roman title for somebody who was in charge of a project or institution ; it is still used by the Greek Orthodox church . Over time the meaning of Oikonomou has evolved from \" manager of resources \" to \" manager of money , a treasurer \" . = = Etymology = = Philologists have been able to track changes in the name Spencer over time \u2014 in different dialects and languages \u2014 as well as trace its derivation from a common ancestry . The name Spencer can be traced through its Latin and French roots to its Middle English and modern form . Medieval Latin \u2013 dispensa , dispensator and dispensarius \u2013 steward . Old French \u2013 a. despense \u2013 larder b. espenser , -ier \u2013 dispenser of money , provisions etc . ; someone working at , or in charge of , the buttery ; a household steward c. despendour \u2013 steward . Anglo-French \u2013 despenser , -ier . Middle English \u2013 spens ( e ) and spence \u2013 larder ; dispensour \u2013 steward . With the agent suffix \u2013 er this becomes spenser \u2013 butler or steward . = = = Derivation = = = In England , up to about the time of the Norman Conquest when communities were small , each person was identifiable by a single name , usually a personal name or nickname . Picts , Gaels , Britons , Anglo-Saxons , Scandinavians and Normans all originally used single names , but as the population increased , it became necessary to identify people further \u2014 giving rise to names like John the butcher , Henry of Sutton , Roger son of Richard and William the short , which naturally evolved into John Butcher , Henry Sutton , Roger Richardson and William Short . Although a few hereditary patrilineal surnames ( those passed from father to son and daughter ) appear to have existed in before the Norman Conquest , the now traditional use of binomials ( two names , a given name and a surname ) appears to have gathered momentum at this time \u2014 particularly after the introduction of records for personal taxation , known in England as the poll tax , first levied in 1275 . The poll tax was the historical means by which local communities recorded the registering , categorizing , and polling of citizens , free-subjects and other voters . The meaning of a surname generally derives from one of the following four sources : location ( toponym ) such as a specific place ( e.g. London , York ) or feature of the place or landscape ( e.g. Hill , Townsend ) ; a relationship ( e.g. Richardson ) ; a nickname ( e.g. Grey , Wellbeloved ) ; or an occupation or office ( e.g. Sawyer , Skinner ) . The surname Spencer relates to occupation and office . = = Robert Despenser , Urse d 'Abbetot , and the Despenser family = = = = = Robert Despenser = = = Robert d 'Abbetot was the son of Almericus d 'Abbetot whose Viking ancestry has been traced back to Tancred of Hauteville ( 980 \u2013 1041 ) . Almericus is known to have held the position of mayor in the town of Saint-Jean-d 'Abbetot in Normandy . Robert , like William 's other close knights , was granted titles , lands and a high position in William 's court . In addition to his position as steward he also was given land grants in county Bedford . He held his office for the period c.1088 \u2013 1098 . Robert 's last name of d 'Abbetot had no meaning in England so it was likely changed to Robert le Despenser ( many spelling variants of this name exist including Robert the Dispensor , Robert Despensator , Robert Dispenser , and Robert fitzThurstin . ) which reflected his new official position and occupation . He seems to have maintained his popularity with William because in the Domesday Book of 1086 , Robert Despenser was listed as a land tenant-in-chief in Gloucestershire , Leicestershire , Lincolnshire , Oxfordshire , and Warwickshire , as well as holding lands in Worcestershire obtained from the Bishop of Worcester . Robert is assumed to have died shortly after restoring some estates to Westminster Abbey but he appears to have had no legitimate male children , as his heir was his brother Urse . He may have had a daughter , as some of his lands were inherited by the Marmion family , but it is also possible that a daughter of Urse married into the Marmion family . Robert 's office as the king 's steward may also have gone to Urse , as it was later held by Urse 's heirs . A later steward , Thurstin , might have been an illegitimate son of Robert . = = = Robert 's brother Urse d 'Abbetot = = = Robert Despenser 's brother , Urse d 'Abbetot ( c . 1040 \u2013 1108 ) , became a medieval Sheriff of Worcester and royal official . He did not take up the name Despenser . In Normandy the brothers lived in the town of Saint Jean d 'Abbetot as tenants on lands of feudal lords in the Tancarville family in the Pays de Caux region on the lower Seine . Ralph Fitz Gerald ( Chamberlain of Tankerville ) was the elder brother of Aumary d 'Abetot . Their father was Gerold ( husband of Helisendis ) Sire de Tankerville with the hereditary office of chamberlain to the Dukes of Normandy . His younger son , Aumary , inherited the fiefs of Abetot and had two sons , Urso and Robert \" Despencer \" who gave the name to the noble families of Le Despencer and Spenser that trace their descent from his niece . In 1073 Urse was one of the king 's council . He rendered great service in the suppression of the rebellion of the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk and had a reputation as a spoiler and devastator of the Church . Urse 's son Roger d 'Abetot , having killed a servant of Henry I , was banished and his confiscated estates given by the king \u2014 together with the hand of his sister Emmeline d 'Abetot \u2014 to Walter de Beauchamp of Bedford . However , within 2 \u2013 3 years of 1066 both brothers were established in England \u2014 Urse as Sheriff of Worcestershire , supervising the construction of Worcester Castle . The Domesday survey showed Urse 's lands mostly in the West Midlands while Robert 's extended to the North Sea . Robert remained a benefactor to the Priory of St. Barbe-en-Auge in Normandy , which had been founded by the Tancarville lords . Lands held by the d 'Abbetots in Worcester are recorded in Hemming 's Cartulary . The d 'Abbetot family settled mostly in Worcester where they were lords of Hindlip ( Hind Leap ) , 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Worcester , for 200 years holding the manor for a knight 's fee , that is , the service of an armed knight in the event of war . A church has stood on the site since the 11th century . Two villages have taken the D 'Abbetot family name . Redmarley D 'Abitot lies on the extreme south-west border of Worcestershire in Gloucestershire . Here the D 'Abitots owned property in the parish in the 16th century , and lived at Down House although the last member of the family is believed to have died in the 18th century . The other village is Croome D 'Abitot , which lies 7 \u2013 8 miles south-east of Worcester . Many of the descendants of Robert Despenser and Urse achieved notoriety of various kinds and the Dispenser line has been traced for at least 10 generations . = = = Associated families = = = The Norman family of de Ferrers , through Henry de Ferrers , had received the largest grants of land and manors in Derbyshire and were closely related to the d 'Abbetots by marriage . Similarly , Urse 's son Roger had a sister , Emmeline , who married Walter de Beauchamp from another influential family of the time . Walter succeeded to Urse 's lands after the exiling of Roger around 1110 . Tradition has it that the Derbyshire D 'Abitots sprang either from Robert d 'Abitot or a junior branch of the Worcester d 'Abitots , although it is more likely to trace directly from Urse . = = Heraldry = = Heraldry , the practice of designing , displaying , describing , and recording coats of arms and badges , arose from the need to distinguish participants in combat when their faces were hidden by iron and steel helmets . The process of creating coats of arms ( these are often called \" family crests \" but in the heraldic traditions of England and Scotland an individual , rather than a family , had a coat of arms ) began in the eight and 9th centuries . Eventually a formal system of rules developed into increasingly complex forms of heraldry that allowed the use of coats of arms by countries , states , provinces , towns and villages in a form of civic heraldry . In more recent times coats of arms have evolved from their military origins to denote educational institutes , and other establishments , apparently leading to the modern logo and corporate livery . The secretum or private seal of Henry le Despenser , Bishop of Norwich ( A.D. 1370 \u2013 1406 ) is shown here . Arms of Hugh le Despencer . = = Hereditary names and genetic lineages = = The possession of the surname Spencer does not necessarily indicate a hereditary relationship to Robert Despenser . Irregularities can occur with non-paternity and it is possible that consecutive but unrelated people in the same occupation may well have adopted the same name resulting in the foundation of many different Spencer genetic lineages . It is known , for example , that in London in the 13th and 14th centuries trade apprentices would take on the names of their masters . Nevertheless , also in London , surnames of all kinds had become hereditary in the patrician class by the 12th century . Nevertheless , the genetic similarity of people with identical surnames has been shown to be quite high , especially those with rarer surnames . It might seem an almost insurmountable task to determine the true lineage of contemporary Spencers when such an \" occupational \" name probably has many founders . Nevertheless , modern genetics now has the capacity to discriminate relationships at an increasingly detailed resolution both in terms of close recent ancestry and distant ancestry . Many people are now using gene testing laboratories as part of a surname DNA project to resolve not only who their close relations are around the world , but also the migration patterns of their ancestors over the 50,000 years since modern man left Africa . In America many Spencers have been traced back genetically to four Spencer brothers : William Spencer 1601 \u2013 1640 , Thomas Spencer 1607 \u2013 1687 , Michael Spencer 1611 \u2013 1653 , and Gerard Spencer 1614 \u2013 1685 . = = The Spencer aristocracy = = The English aristocratic Spencer family has resided at their ancestral home at Althorp , Northamptonshire , since the early 16th century . The Estate now covers 14,000 acres ( 57 km2 ) in Northamptonshire , Warwickshire and Norfolk . From pre-Tudor times the Spencers had been farmers , coming to prominence in Warwickshire in the 15th century when John Spencer became feoffee of Wormleighton in 1469 , and a tenant at Althorp in 1486 . His nephew , another John , used the gains from trade in livestock and commodities to buy both properties . He was knighted in 1504 and died in 1522 . John 's descendants expanded the family holdings through business dealings and marriage into the peerage . The family is related through marriage to the Churchills of Blenheim Palace , a line that included the Dukes of Marlborough and Winston Churchill . From the Althorp line came the Earls of Sunderland , the later Dukes of Marlborough , and the Earls Spencer . The family captured international attention when Lady Diana Frances Spencer married Prince Charles on 29 July 1981 , and her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 . = = Notable Spencers = = The following is a small selection of notable Spencers . = = = 13th Century = = = Hugh le Despenser I ( died 1238 ) was a wealthy land owner in the East Midlands of England , as well as High Sheriff of Berkshire .

                "Court of Common Pleas ( England ) = The Court of Common Pleas , or Common Bench , was a common law court in the English legal system that covered \" common pleas \" ; actions between subject and subject , which did not concern the king . Created in the late 12th to early 13th century after splitting from the Exchequer of Pleas , the Common Pleas served as one of the central English courts for around 600 years . Authorised by Magna Carta to sit in a fixed location , the Common Pleas sat in Westminster Hall for its entire existence , joined by the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of King 's Bench . The court 's jurisdiction was gradually undercut by the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas with legal fictions , the Bill of Middlesex and Writ of Quominus respectively . The Common Pleas maintained its exclusive jurisdiction over matters of real property until its dissolution , and due to its wide remit was considered by Sir Edward Coke to be the \" lock and key of the common law \" . It was staffed by one Chief Justice and a varying number of puisne justices , who were required to be Serjeants-at-Law , and until the mid 19th century only Serjeants were allowed to plead there . As one of the two principal common law courts with the King 's Bench , the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload , in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary . Reaching an acceptable medium with the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts ; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction , there was little need for separate bodies , and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice . With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880 , the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist , marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas . = = History = = = = = Origin = = = Originally , the sole fixed \" court \" was the curia regis , one of the three central administrative bodies along with the Exchequer and Chancery , from which the Court of Chancery formed . This curia was the king 's court , composed of those advisers and courtiers who followed the king as he travelled around the country . This was not a dedicated court of law , instead a descendant of the witenagemot . In concert with the curia regis , eyre circuits staffed by itinerant judges dispensed justice throughout the country , operating on fixed paths at certain times . These judges were also members of the curia , and would hear cases on the king 's behalf in the \" lesser curia regis \" . Gradually , the curia split into two distinct branches , the coram rege ( King 's Bench ) and de banco ( Common Bench , or Common Pleas ) . Much academic discussion occurs over the circumstances and times of their founding . In 1178 , a chronicler recorded that when Henry II : learned that the land and the men of the land were burdened by so great a number of justices , for there were , eighteen , chose with the counsel of the wise men of his kingdom five only , two clerks three and laymen , all of his private family , and decreed that these five should hear all complaints of the kingdom and should do right and should not depart from the king 's court but should remain there to hear the complaints of men , with this understanding that , if there should come up among them any question which could not be brought to a conclusion by them , it should be presented to a royal hearing and be determined by the king and the wiser men of the kingdom \" . This was originally interpreted as the foundation of the King 's Bench , with the Court of Common Pleas not coming into existence until the signing of Magna Carta , which mandated in Section 17 that common pleas ( cases between subject and subject , as opposed to cases involving the king ) be heard in \" some fixed place \" . This ensured that rather than the source of justice moving from place to place as the king did , there would be a fixed location that claimants and defendants could travel to that would address their problems . The later theory was that Henry II 's decree created the Court of Common Pleas , not the King 's Bench , and that the King 's Bench instead split from the Common Pleas at some later time . In the 20th century , with better access to historical documents , legal historians have come to a different conclusion . Rather than the Common Pleas being created out of the curia regis directly , it instead arose out of the Exchequer of Pleas , another body split from the curia regis . By the beginning of the 13th century , a split began ; chronicles from 1201 identify the \" bench \" and \" exchequer \" as distinct bodies , and records of Barons of the Exchequer and Justices of the Common Pleas show a distinct lack of overlap . The Court of Common Pleas , along with the other superior courts , sat in Westminster Hall from its creation . Due to the provisions in Magna Carta , it was bound to sit there ; an apocryphal story says that Orlando Bridgeman refused to move the court a few feet to avoid the draught from the north entrance , fearing that to do so would be to infringe on Magna Carta . The court sat in a space marked off by a wooden bar ( which counsel stood behind ) with the court officials sitting at a large oak table covered in green cloth and the justices on a raised platform ( or \" bench \" ) at the rear of the court . = = = Struggle with the King 's Bench = = = During the 15th century , the common law courts were challenged by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts . These courts and legal methods were much faster than the common law courts , so lawyers and claimants flocked to them . This was perceived as a threat to the common law courts , for good reason ; between 1460 and 1540 , the business of the common law courts significantly dropped , while the Chancery 's cases rose massively in number . In reaction to this , the Court of King 's Bench developed its own , faster system , intent on winning cases back , and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction . While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old common law courts and the new courts , it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas , who became highly reactionary to the changes the King 's Bench attempted to introduce . When the King 's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction , the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases . This was limited by the fact that the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs , leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King 's Bench became faster , cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction . The troubles during this period are best illustrated by Slade 's Case . Under the medieval common law , claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Common Pleas , a problematic and archaic process . By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method , enforced by the Court of King 's Bench , through the action of assumpsit , which was technically for deceit . The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so , a defendant had committed deceit , and was liable to the plaintiff . The conservative Common Pleas , through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber , began to overrule decisions made by the King 's Bench on assumpsit , causing friction between the courts . In Slade 's Case , the Chief Justice of the King 's Bench , John Popham , deliberately provoked the Common Pleas into bringing an assumpsit action to a higher court where the Justices of the King 's Bench could vote , allowing them to overrule the Common Pleas and establish assumpsit as the main contractual action . After the death of Edmund Anderson , the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas , which briefly led to a less reactionary and more revolutionary court . The Interregnum granted some respite to the Common Pleas , which abolished fines on original writs , hurting the King 's Bench , but in 1660 the fines were reinstated and \" then the very attorneys of the Common Pleas boggled at them and carried all their finable business to the King 's Bench \" . In 1661 the Common Pleas attempted to reverse this by pushing for an Act of Parliament to abolish latitats based on legal fictions , forbidding \" special bail \" in any case where \" the true cause of action \" was not expressed in the process . The King 's Bench got around this in the 1670s ; the Act did not say that the process had to be true , so the court continued to use legal fictions , simply ensuring that the true cause of action was expressed in the process , regardless of whether or not it was correct . The Bill of Middlessex disclosed the true cause of action , satisfying the 1661 statute , but did not require a valid complaint . This caused severe friction within the court system , and Francis North , Chief Justice of the Common Pleas , eventually reached a compromise by allowing such legal fictions in the Common Pleas as well as the King 's Bench . = = = Unity and dissolution = = = The unintended outcome of these compromises was that by the end of Charles II 's reign , all three common law courts had a similar jurisdiction over most common pleas , with similar processes . By the 18th century , it was customary to speak of the \" twelve justices \" of the three courts , not distinguishing them , and assize cases were shared equally between them . In 1828 , Henry Brougham complained that The jurisdiction of the Court of King 's Bench , for example , was originally confined to pleas of the Crown , and then extended to actions where violence was used - actions of trespass , by force ; but now , all actions are admissible within its walls , through the medium of a legal fiction , which was adopted for the purpose of enlarging its authority , that every person sued is in the custody of the marshal of the court and may , therefore , be proceeded against for any personal cause of actions . Thus , by degrees , this court has drawn over to itself actions which really belong to ... the Court of Common Pleas . The Court of Common Pleas , however ... never was able to obtain cognizance of - the peculiar subject of King 's Bench jurisdiction - Crown Pleas ... the Exchequer has adopted a similar course for , though it was originally confined to the trial of revenue cases , it has , by means of another fiction - the supposition that everybody sued is a debtor to the Crown , and further , that he cannot pay his debt , because the other party will not pay him , - opened its doors to every suitor , and so drawn to itself the right of trying cases , that were never intended to be placed within its jurisdiction . The purpose of Brougham 's speech was to illustrate that three courts of identical jurisdiction were unnecessary , and further that it would create a situation where the best judges , lawyers and cases would eventually go to one court , overburdening that body and leaving the others near-useless . In 1823 , 43,465 actions were brought in the King 's Bench , 13,009 in the Common Pleas and 6,778 in the Exchequer of Pleas . Not surprisingly , the King 's Bench judges were \" immoderately over burdened \" , the Common Pleas judges were \" fully occupied in term , and much engaged in vacation also \" and the Barons of the Exchequer were \" comparatively little occupied either in term or vacation \" . In response to this and the report of a committee investigating the slow pace of the Court of Chancery , the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867 , and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts , the law , and the legal profession . Five reports were issued , from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874 , with the first ( dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature ) considered the most influential . The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity , and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of utilising both . In 1870 the Lord Chancellor , Lord Hatherly , attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament , but did not go to the trouble of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives , who controlled the House of Lords . The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges , particularly Alexander Cockburn . After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selbourne in September 1872 , a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary ; although along the same lines , it was far more detailed . The Act , finally passed as the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 , merged the Common Pleas , Exchequer , King 's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body , the High Court of Justice , with the divisions between the courts to remain . The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist , except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court . The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law , which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices . By sheer chance , both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880 , allowing for the abolition of the Common Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880 , with their functions merged into the King 's Bench Division , with the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales . = = Jurisdiction = = The Common Pleas ' jurisdiction was over \" common pleas , \" cases where the king had no interest . This in practice meant cases between subject and subject , including all actions taken under praecipe to recover debts or property , which made up the vast majority of civil cases . As such , the Common Pleas \" was the court which more than any other shaped the medieval common law \" . It was the court where most students went to learn , and the majority of the early case reports come from the Common Pleas . The court was called \" the lock and key of the common law \" by Sir Edward Coke , since throughout its history it was the only court where claims involving real property could be brought , giving it a wider remit to set precedent than the other courts . For almost all of its history , Serjeants at Law and King 's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of audience in the Court of Common Pleas . As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties , such as levying fines . In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister , Serjeant or not , and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid . The Serjeants only enjoyed their returned status for another six years , however , before Parliament intervened . The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846 , from 18 August 1846 , allowed all barristers to practice in the Court of Common Pleas . From the 13th century onwards , the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs , and was not dependent on the Court of Chancery , where such documents usually originated . These were sealed with the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338 , along with the seal of the justices ; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal . Documents were , from 1350 , considered acceptable if only marked with the seal of the justices . In 1344 , the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas , allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king . The court stood on an equal footing with the Exchequer of Pleas , Court of Chancery and King 's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them . Any errors on the part of the Common Pleas would be corrected by the King 's Bench through a separate action brought there . Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions , the King 's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas 's jurisdiction , although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought . = = Structure = = = = = Justices = = = The Common Pleas was staffed by a number of Justices , under one Chief Justice . The number of Justices at any one time varied ; between 1377 and 1420 there were generally four , switching to five from 1420 to 1471 . From 1471 onwards , the number was fixed at 3 . This changed in the 19th century ; provisions were made for the appointment of a Fourth Justice and Fifth Justice in 1830 and 1868 respectively . From the start of the 14th century , Justices were appointed via letters patent made under the Great Seal , and held their appointments \" under the pleasure of the King \" . Justices received the same remuneration as judges of the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of King 's Bench ; \u00a3 1,000 in 1660 , increased to \u00a3 2,000 in 1759 and \u00a3 4,000 in 1809 . From 1799 , pensions were also awarded to retiring Justices . The Chief Justice was one of the highest judicial officials in England , behind only the Lord High Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice of the King 's ( or Queen 's ) Bench . Initially the position of Chief Justice was not an appointment ; of the justices serving in the court , one would become more respected than his peers , and was therefore considered the \" chief \" justice . The position was formalised in 1272 with the raising of Sir Gilbert of Preston to Chief Justice , and from then on it was considered a formally appointed role similar to the positions of Chief Justice of the King 's Bench and Chief Baron of the Exchequer . Both the puisne and Chief justices were required to be Serjeants-at-Law , and were appointed by letters patent . The Serjeant would then be greeted by the Lord Chancellor , who would inform him of his new position ; the letters patent would then be read out in court , and the new justice would swear an oath to do \" justice without favour , to all men pleading before him , friends and foes alike \" , not to \" delay to do so even though the king should command him by his letters or by word of mouth to the contrary \" or \" receive from anyone except the king any fee or other pension or livery nor take any gift from the pleaders before him , except food and drink of no great price \" . The innovation of appointment by letters patent was a scheme of Edward III 's to avoid the potential for bribery , by providing a method through which judges could be paid . This income was supplemented through work on commissions of assize , goal deliveries , and oyer and terminer . The justice would also receive fees from the parties in court , through the costs of judicial writs . = = = Other offices = = = The justices were assisted by a staff of over 50 officials , most of whom sat in Westminster Hall but also kept offices at the various Inns of Court . The Chief Clerk was the Custos Brevium , appointed by the crown , but in practice clerking matters were handled by his deputy , as the office was a royal favour rather than a serious judicial appointment . The crown also appointed the court chirographer , responsible for noting final concords and filing records of fines . Another high-ranking clerk was the Clerk of the Outlawries , an under-clerk of the Attorney General for England and Wales , who was tasked with recording recognizances to protect the interests of the King in common law matters . In 1541 his position was replaced with the office of Clerk of the King 's Process . Other offices created during the reign of Henry VIII include the Clerk of the Recognizances in 1432 , who recorded debts secured by recognizances and the office of Receiver of Debts , who was tasked with receiving and recording money coming into the court via debts and fines , and was first appointed in 1536 . Due to their technical knowledge , the most important officers were the three Prothonotaries , the first and third of whom were appointed by the Chief Justice and the second by the Chief Justice on the advice of the Custos Brevium . They were responsible for enrolling records of litigation , including anything that raised a point of law , and were often consulted by the court due to their detailed technical knowledge . The Chief Justice also appointed the Clerk of the Warrants , Clerk of the Treasury ( also known as the Clerk of Hell ) , the Keeper of the Seal , the Clerk of Essoins and the Clerk of Acknowledgments of Fines and Recoveries ( who was officially the Chief Justice 's own clerk , rather than that of the court ) , as well as other officials . The Custos Brevium appointed the Clerk of the Juries , responsible for issuing writs of Habeas Corpus . There were four Exigenters tasked with issuing and controlling the process of declaring someone an Outlaw , with each Exigenter assigned a set of counties . The most valuable of the Exigenterships was that for London , Middlesex , Sussex , Kent , Dorset , Somerset , Devon , Cambridgeshire , Huntingdonshire , Bristol and Exeter due to the number of processes each year , with London alone handling over 100 documents a year by the mid-1550s . By tradition the Exigenter for Yorkshire and the other northern counties was also Filazer for Northumberland , Westmorland , Cumberland and Newcastle , and Clerk of the King 's Silver for the entire country . There were also thirteen Filazers , who shared counties between them according to historical divisions , and were tasked with filing judicial writs for their counties and transferring them to the Custos Brevium for filing . A fourteenth Filazer was appointed for Monmouthshire in 1542 , but other than this there were no changes to the position until the abolition of the court . The Warden of the Fleet Prison , who was also keeper of Westminster Hall , was tasked with keeping it clean and letting the shops and booths along the sides . Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas , Court of Chancery and Star Chamber as part of his duties the Warden was considered an officer of the Court of Common Pleas . All court officers were appointed for life , and could only be removed for misbehaviour . Despite this , the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice 's tenure , and selling them could be very profitable .",
                "United States v. Alvarez = United States v. Alvarez , 567 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2012 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act , a federal law that criminalized false statements about having a military medal . The law had been passed as an effort to stem instances where people falsely claimed to have won the medal in an attempt to protect the \" valor \" of those who really had . While a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court agreed that the law was unconstitutional under the First Amendment 's free speech protections , it could not agree on a single rationale . Four justices concluded that a statement 's falsity is not enough , by itself , to exclude speech from First Amendment protection . Another two justices concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection , the Stolen Valor Act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways . Veteran organizations and politicians reacted negatively . Several months after the decision , both chambers of Congress passed new versions of the Stolen Valor Act based on the suggestions in the Court 's opinion . Despite the Supreme Court having struck down the conviction under the Act , Alvarez remained in prison for fraud on other matters . = = Background = = = = = Stolen Valor Act = = = President George W. Bush signed the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 , ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 ) , into law on December 20 , 2006 . The Act broadens previous provisions addressing the unauthorized wear , manufacture , or sale of any military decorations and medals by making it a misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as having received any U.S. military decoration or medal . If convicted , defendants may be imprisoned for up to six months , unless the decoration lied about is the Medal of Honor , in which case imprisonment could be up to one year . Proponents in Congress argued that the law was passed to prevent impostors from \" stealing the valor \" of soldiers returning from engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan . = = = Alvarez 's statements = = = In 2007 at a Three Valley Water District Board meeting in Claremont , California , new member Xavier Alvarez introduced himself by saying \" I 'm a retired Marine of 25 years . I retired in the year 2001 . Back in 1987 , I was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor . I got wounded many times by the same guy . \" As this statement was not true , Alvarez was indicted for violating the Stolen Valor Act . The United States District Court for the Central District of California , the place where the trial was to occur , rejected Alvarez 's claim that the Act was unconstitutional . This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid . Rehearing by the entire panel of the Ninth Circuit ( instead of just the three judges ) was denied over the dissent of seven judges . Judge Smith , one of the dissenters , argued that the panel \" incorrectly rested its laurels on Supreme Court rulings in defamation cases that false facts did not receive First Amendment protections . \" Smith argued that this was not a defamation case , because even if the act was intended to prevent injury to military personnel , \" [ t ] he right against defamation belongs to natural persons , not to governmental institutions or symbols . \" The government appealed the Ninth Circuit 's decision , which was subsequently granted by the Supreme Court in 2011 . = = Supreme Court oral arguments = = The Supreme Court heard oral argument on February 22 , 2012 . Donald Verrilli , Jr . , Solicitor General of the United States , appeared on behalf of the United States . Jonathan D. Libby , Deputy Federal Public Defender , appeared on behalf of Alvarez . Verrilli spoke first ; he began by explaining that military honors touch on the core values of the armed forces , and the Stolen Valor Act simply aims to protect those core values . Almost immediately Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Verrilli a hypothetical : During the Vietnam War , a protester holds up a sign that says , \" I won a Purple Heart \u2013 for killing babies . \" Knowing statement . He didn 't win the Purple Heart . As a reader , I can 't be sure whether he did and is a combat veteran who opposes the war , or whether he 's a citizen protesting the war . Is that person , if he 's not a veteran , having received the medal , is he liable under this act ? Verrilli responded by suggesting that such an act would be covered by the Act only if it were \" reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of fact or as an exercise in political theater . \" The questions during Verrilli 's argument focused on the lack of injury caused by false claims of military honors . In nearly all the cases that the United States cited to support the proposition that there is no First Amendment value in falsity , the Court had addressed a false statement that harmed another , such as a defamatory statement . Relying on these cases , Verrilli stated , \" [ T ] his Court has said in numerous contexts , numerous contexts , that the calculated factual falsehood has no First Amendment value for its own sake . \" Justice Anthony Kennedy immediately retorted : Well , I 'm \u2013 I 'm not sure that that 's quite correct . It has said it often , but always in context where it is well understood that speech can injure .... You think there 's no value to falsity . But I \u2013 I simply can 't find that in our cases , and I \u2013 I think it 's a sweeping proposition to say that there 's no value to falsity . Falsity is a way in which we contrast what is false and what is true . Libby opened the defense argument by emphasizing that the First Amendment is intended to protect personal autonomy . In response to several questions , Libby played on the Court 's discontent with the apparent lack of harm by stating that there is value in falsity \" so long as it doesn 't cause imminent harm to another person or imminent harm to a government function . \" Libby stumbled in the Court 's estimation , however , when he conceded that the Act did not chill any truthful speech . In response , Justice Kagan stated , \" So , boy , I mean , that 's a big concession , Mr. Libby . Then you 're saying , you can only win this case if this Court decides that the Gertz statement was a kind of overstatement , an exaggeration , puffery . \" = = Supreme Court 's decision = = On June 28 , 2012 , a divided Supreme Court held that the Stolen Valor Act 's prohibition against making false statements of having been awarded a military medal violated the First Amendment . However , the six justices in the majority could not agree on a single rationale for the decision . = = = Kennedy 's plurality opinion = = = Justice Anthony Kennedy , writing for a plurality consisting of himself , Chief Justice John Roberts , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , and Justice Sonia Sotomayor , wrote that false statements are not , by the sole reason of their falsity , excluded from First Amendment protection . \" The Court has never endorsed the categorical rule the Government advances , \" Kennedy wrote . \" Our prior decisions have not confronted a measure , like the Stolen Valor Act , that targets falsity and nothing more . \" Even though there are several examples of the use of penalizing false speech ( like perjury ) , Kennedy argued that \" [ t ] he Government has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new category of unprotected speech ... \" The plurality opinion also expressed the wide applicability of the Stolen Valor Act . \" The Act by its plain terms , \" Kennedy wrote , \" applies to a false statement made at any time , in any place , to any person \" . Such breadth means that the law is \" sweeping ... [ the ] reach of the statute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment ... the statute would apply with equal force to personal , whispered conversations within a home . \" When balanced against the Government 's need to protect the value of the Medal , the plurality said that \" the link between the Government 's interest in protecting the integrity of the military honors system and the Act 's restriction on the false claims of liars like respondent has not been shown . \" Additionally , Kennedy wrote that ' counter-speech ' was a sufficient solution to the problem : \" It is a fair assumption that any true holders of the Medal who had heard of Alvarez 's false claims would have been fully vindicated by the community 's expression of outrage ... Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its vindication . \" Wrote Kennedy : \" Permitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense , whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a barely audible whisper , would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable . That governmental power has no clear limiting principal . Our constitutional tradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania \u2019 s Ministry of Truth , \" invoking George Orwell 's novel 1984 . = = = Breyer 's concurrence = = = Justice Stephen Breyer , joined by Justice Elena Kagan , agreed that the Stolen Valor Act was unconstitutional , but on entirely different grounds . Breyer based his finding not on a strict scrutiny test that the plurality had used , but on a \" proportionality \" or \" intermediate scrutiny test \" . This test examines \" whether the statute works speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its justifications . \" After holding that Congress could create a database of those who had won the Medal , among other alternatives to the existing law , Breyer said that there were lesser restrictive means to achieve the government 's interest . = = = Alito 's dissent = = = Justice Samuel Alito , joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , dissented from the Court 's decision striking down the Act . For Alito , the ruling had \" [ broken ] sharply from a long line of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does not protect false factual statements that inflict real harm and serve no legitimate interest . \" \" The Stolen Valor Act , \" Alito wrote , \" represents the judgment of the people 's elected representatives that false statements about military awards are very different from false statements about civilian awards ... [ the Act ] is a narrow law enacted to address an important problem , and it presents no threat to freedom of expression . \" = = Subsequent developments = = = = = Reaction = = = The decision received praise on constitutional grounds from across the political spectrum . The First Amendment Center called the decision \" a victory for free speech and common sense . \" The conservative Daily Caller described it as a \" clear cut case \" and found it disturbing that three justice who have traditionally represented themselves as constitutional originalists \" had in fact dissented from protecting free speech . Several veterans organizations leaders were dismayed by the decision . A spokesperson for the Veterans of Foreign Wars said \" Despite the ruling , the VFW will continue to challenge far-fetched stories , and to publicize these false heroes to the broadest extent possible as a deterrent to others . \u201d Harold A. Fritz , a recipient of the medal from the Vietnam War agreed with the VFW that \" It \u2019 s more than just a piece of metal suspended on a piece of cloth on a pin . . . . And people who abuse that . . . need to be penalized . \" Proponents of the Stolen Valor Act promised to bring forward more limited legislation in the future . The American Legion expressed hope that a narrower law would survive constitutional scrutiny . \" We felt good about portions of the decision which suggest that a more narrowly tailored bill which incorporates traditional fraud elements would be upheld , \" says Fang Wong , national commander of the American Legion .

                "Representative democracy in Singapore = Singapore has a multi-party parliamentary system of representative democracy in which the President of Singapore is the head of state and the Prime Minister of Singapore is the head of government . Executive power is vested in the President and the Cabinet . Cabinet has the general direction and control of the government and is collectively responsible to the Parliament . There are three separate branches of government : the legislature , executive and judiciary . Representative democracy began in the 1940s when the number of elected seats in the legislature gradually increased , until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958 . At present , Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of representative democracy . Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage . Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution , the Government has affirmed that the right may be implied into the constitutional text . The Constitution vests the three branches of the state with different aspects of governmental power . The executive is made up of the President and the Cabinet , which is headed by the Prime Minister . The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy . The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service . To qualify as a presidential candidate , stringent criteria must be satisfied . The Constitution further provides for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament ( MPs ) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies , Non-constituency Members of Parliament ( NCMPs ) and Nominated Members of Parliament ( NMPs ) . MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have . The Government 's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system . While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation of the concept of representative democracy , it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution , such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV . The right to freedom of speech and expression , which is guaranteed to Singapore citizens by Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore , is essential to the concept of representative democracy . Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament , Speakers ' Corner , and the new media . However , Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds . One of these is the protection of reputation . Critics have charged that Cabinet ministers and members of the ruling People 's Action Party have used civil defamation suits against opposition politicians to inhibit their activities and exclude them from Parliament . The Government has said that there is no evidence substantiating such claims . In addition , both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government . Article 14 protects the right to freedom of assembly which is relevant to free speech as the latter is often exercised at assemblies and gatherings . Free assembly is restricted in Singapore through laws that require permits to be obtained before events are held , though an exception is made for indoor events involving organizers and speakers who are citizens . The Government has been accused of slowing down the progress of democracy by using the Internal Security Act ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) to detain political opponents and suppress political criticism . In response , the Government has asserted that no person has been detained purely for their political beliefs . = = Government 's understanding of representative democracy = = Representative democracy has been described as \" a system of government where the people in free elections elect [ ] their representatives to the legislative chamber which occupies the most powerful position in the political system \" . The meaning of the term was discussed in the Parliament of Singapore on 27 August 2008 upon a motion moved by Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann , a professor of constitutional law at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law , for the House to affirm the importance of representative democracy and to call on the Government to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act to make the calling of by-elections mandatory in Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) in certain situations . According to Thio , under the view of representative democracy taken by the 18th-century British Member of Parliament ( MP ) and philosopher Edmund Burke , \" an MP is no mere delegate who simply mouths his constituents ' views . An MP is chosen for his ' mature judgment ' and ' enlightened conscience . ' \" Thus , an MP \" has to represent his constituents in tending to municipal affairs \" , but also \" be concerned with national affairs \" , and , \" as a party member , he must toe the party line \" . In addition , an MP of a minority ethnic group in a GRC \" has to carry the concerns of his particular minority community as well \" . For this reason , she felt that if the seat of a minority MP in a GRC became vacant , it should be incumbent on the Government to call a by-election to fill it . Opposing the motion , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that the Burkean model of representative democracy \" puts the emphasis on choosing candidates to become MPs as the fundamental element of the whole scheme \" , with the result that \" if an MP dies or resigns , ... he has to be replaced , so a by-election has to be held promptly without delay \" . However , in the Government 's view , representative democracy is better understood as having an \" emphasis on choosing political parties to form the government and to have political parties as the fundamental element in the system \" : Parties will field candidates to contest in general elections . They have to be high quality people \u2013 with integrity , ability , commitment , drive \u2013 all the attributes which we look for in an ideal candidate . But the candidate is not on his own . He carries the banner of the party . ... [ H ] e identifies himself for the party 's manifesto , the programmes and the promises that the party makes . ... In this scheme , if voters in the general election support the party and vote its candidates in , and they form a majority in Parliament , then that party with a majority in Parliament forms the government . And that party has a mandate , not only because it so happens that this specific group of MPs , at this moment , supports it , but because it stood in a general election and the voters gave it the mandate , and indirectly , through the MP , voted for this party to form the government of the country , and to govern the country until the next general elections are called . Therefore , the emphasis in this system is on the ruling Party delivering on its programmes and promises . Consequently , if a parliamentary seat falls vacant mid-term , it does not have to be filled immediately as \" [ t ] he vacancy does not affect the mandate of the Government , nor its ability to deliver on its programmes or promises . And this mandate continues until the next general election is called , when the incumbent team will render account to the electorate . \" The Prime Minister said that the Singapore system of government was based on this model for two reasons : first , to \" encourage voters to think very carefully when they are voting during general elections , because you are not only voting for your representative in the constituency , you are voting for the government in the country \" ; and , secondly , \" to maximise the chances of a stable , effective government in between general elections \" . = = History = = Singapore was colonized by the British in the 19th century , during which society was ruled according to English law . The result was the transplantation of the Western idea of representative democracy into Singapore 's legal system . This idea has taken root and developed tremendously since the end of World War II into what it is today . = = = Before World War II = = = After Singapore was founded in 1819 , she was under the jurisdiction of British rule . For a long time , representative democracy was non-existent . In 1920 , a select committee which was established to reform the Legislative Council argued that Singapore was not ready for democratic ideas \u2013 to allow people to elect members into the Legislative Council might result in giving the \" professional politician the opportunity of obtaining power by playing on religious and social prejudices \" . Even though the Council lacked popular representation of the locals , the population was generally satisfied with the system and the policies of the Governor of the Straits Settlements were influenced by opinions expressed by the public and in the press . = = = After World War II = = = It was only in 1946 , after the Japanese Occupation and the disbanding of the Straits Settlements , that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council . The Council then consisted of at least 22 but not more than 24 members . Only nine members were elected , out of which the Singapore Chamber of Commerce , the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce were each allotted one seat . The other six seats were to be filled by democratic elections based on universal suffrage . Elections were held for the first time on 20 March 1948 . Even so , the general public was apathetic towards the new political situation and the British regarded this as the major impediment to the development of democratic government in Singapore . Thus , a constitutional commission headed by Sir George Rendel was set up in 1953 to recommend changes in the constitutional system , with the aim of increasing widespread participation in the central and local government of Singapore . The Government accepted most of the Rendel Commission 's recommendations in its report of February 1954 . One suggested reform was to transform the Legislative Council into an Assembly of 32 members , of whom 25 would be elected . The \" Leader of the House \" or \" Chief Minister \" would be the leader of the largest political party in the Assembly or of a coalition of parties assured of majority support . Representation by the Chambers of Commerce was also removed . The amended Constitution of Singapore also provided for a Council of Ministers appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the Chief Minister , consisting of three unelected Official Members and six Elected Members . As the Constitution was unclear on the powers of the ministers , the discretion to make crucial decisions and formulate policies was understood to reside in the Governor and the Official Members . = = = Self-governance , merger with Malaysia , and independence = = = A fully elected Legislative Assembly was finally established in 1958 , when Singapore relinquished its colonial status to become a self-governing state . Its powers extended to areas not previously under its purview , such as defence and foreign policy . This situation remained throughout merger with Malaysia in 1963 , and after separation from Malaysia and full independence in 1965 . In the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965 entered into between Malaysia and Singapore , Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed on behalf of the people and Government of Singapore that as from 9 August 1965 Singapore \" shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation , founded upon the principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society \" . After independence , the Parliament of Singapore remained fully elected until 1984 , when amendments to the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ( \" NCMPs \" ) . NCMPs , who are declared elected by the returning officer , consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast . The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament . In 1990 , yet another type of unelected Member was introduced \u2013 the Nominated Member of Parliament ( \" NMP \" ) . These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament . = = Voting = = = = = Role in a representative democracy = = = Voting is regarded as key to representative democracy , which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people . The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights . Every person , therefore , has a right to one vote , and no more , in the choice of representatives . The right to vote is a primary right , a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected . It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard , the ballot box is the people 's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies . However , it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy ; rather , it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance . = = = Right to vote = = = The right to vote in Singapore is an implied constitutional right arising from various provisions in the Constitution . These include Articles 65 and 66 , which provide for a maximum term of five years for each Parliament and for a general election to be held within three months after Parliament is dissolved . In a parliamentary debate in 2009 , NMP Thio Li-ann suggested that the Government should amend the Constitution to expressly include a right to vote . She said : A right of fundamental importance should be recognised as a fundamental right and constitutionally entrenched . Only the most important rights and interests are constitutionalised ... The right to vote is not an ancillary or new-fangled right ; it is fundamental and long-established . Thio noted that in 1966 the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission had considered it \" necessary and wise \" to constitutionally entrench the right to vote by making it removable only by a majority of two-thirds of the electorate voting at a national referendum . In addition , she cited the case of Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor ( 1988 ) , where the High Court had made a statement which seemed to indicate that the right to vote is a privilege rather than a right . In reply , Minister for Law K. Shanmugam affirmed that the right to vote is indeed a constitutional right . He noted that it cannot be a privilege in a representative democracy since that would imply that there exists an institution superior to the body of citizens which can grant such a privilege . He also asserted that , ultimately , \" it is the mettle of the people and its leadership \" that determine whether the Constitution is abided by as the supreme law of the land . In response to Thio 's point on the views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission , Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting , a result of the country 's history of colonial rule . In contrast , the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point . With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case , Shanmugam stated that since the Court 's observations were obiter , they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent . = = = First-past-the-post system = = = The \" first-past-the-post \" voting system , also known as the simple plurality voting system , is used in Singapore for electing the President as well as Members of the Parliament . This system has been criticized as undemocratic because the eventual winner may have won only a minority of the total votes cast , despite having secured the most number of votes in absolute terms among all the candidates . Thus , there might be cases where an elected politician can be said to have won the mandate of only a minority of voters , and that his or her election is therefore not an accurate reflection of the voters ' will . As constitutional lawyer Sir William Wade has said : \" If it is accepted that a democratic Parliament ought to represent so far as possible the preferences of the voters , this system is probably the worst that could be devised . \" In the 2006 general election , despite only achieving 66.6 % of the total votes cast , the ruling People 's Action Party ( \" PAP \" ) was returned to power with 82 out of the 84 seats . While there were more opposition members elected to the Parliament in the 2011 general election , PAP held on to 81 of 87 seats in the Parliament despite securing only 60.1 % of the votes . Also , during the 2011 presidential election , President Tony Tan Keng Yam won with only 35.2 % of the total votes . = = = Eligibility to vote = = = Voting in Singapore is compulsory . Any citizen above 21 years of age who is not disqualified by the factors in section 6 of the Parliamentary Elections Act is required to vote in person . There is no constitutional provision stipulating any qualifications for voters , and as the Act is an ordinary piece of legislation the disqualifying factors may be changed by a simple majority ( more than 50 % ) of votes in Parliament . To be eligible to vote at a contested election in any constituency , a voter 's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency . The name of the voter will be included in the register of electors for a constituency if on the cut-off date for the production of the register of electors the voter is a citizen of Singapore , at least 21 years old , and ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency . For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors , information stated on a voter 's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine that he or she complies with the above requirements , unless the facts are shown to be otherwise . = = Democratic institutions = = = = = Legislature = = = The Legislature of Singapore consists of the President and the Parliament . The concept of representative democracy is embodied in the Legislature and is given effect in part through various parliamentary innovations that have been introduced over the years , such as Group Representation Constituencies , Non-constituency Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament . = = = = Constituencies = = = = There are two types of constituencies ( electoral divisions ) in Singapore : Single Member Constituencies ( SMCs ) and Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) . In SMCs candidates vie individually for parliamentary seats , whereas in GRCs the contest is between teams of candidates . Under the GRC scheme , which came into effect on 1 June 1988 , the Government may , having regard to the number of voters in a particular constituency , advise the President to declare it to be a GRC and designate it as a constituency in which at least one of the candidates is from the Malay community , or from the Indian or some other minority community in Singapore . Each team in a GRC may have between three and six candidates . The GRC scheme seeks to ensure a multiracial Parliament and seeks to secure \" the long-term political stability of Singapore ... by ensuring that Parliament will always be multi-racial and representative of our society , and ... by encouraging the practice of multi-racial politics by all political parties \" . It also encourages political parties to appeal to all races with moderate policies , and not to one race or another with chauvinist or extremist policies . Further , it has been suggested that the scheme puts a \" premium on parties which can field credible teams \" , thereby demonstrating that they are \" fit not just to become MPs but to form the government \" . The GRC scheme has been criticized as weakening the candidate \u2013 voter relationship , because it may be more difficult for voters to feel that candidates actually represent them when there are a number of candidates in a team to vote for . Most voters elect MPs whom they can identify with and are better able to represent their interests . It would be much easier for voters to identify with a single candidate than with a team of , say , four individuals . Also , since there will be key vote pullers in every GRC , the unknown or unpopular candidate is \" dragged into Parliament on the coat-tails of the major vote-puller \" . This alienates the electorate from its representatives , thereby undermining the idea of representation . Since the people \" cannot clearly identify themselves with the candidates ... responsibility for choices cannot be ascribed to the people \" . In addition , it has been suggested that the GRC scheme merely provides an appearance of a united , multiracial Parliament . In fact , minority representatives are required to vote according to their party line ; they are not allowed to vote specifically in the interests of their racial groups . The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented . = = = = Non-constituency Members of Parliament = = = = The NCMP Scheme was introduced in 1984 to ensure the presence of Opposition Members in Parliament . The NCMP Scheme serves to ensure that the voices of the minority are still heard . Thus , to qualify as an NCMP , the candidate must have won at least 15 % of the total number of votes . The powers of an NCMP are restricted in Art 39 ( 2 ) of the Constitution : an NCMP cannot vote on a bill to amend the Constitution ; a supply , supplementary supply or final supply bill ; a money bill ; a vote of no confidence in the Government ; or a motion for removing the President from office . Despite the aim of the NCMP scheme to ameliorate the impacts of the first-past-the-post system , its legitimacy is highly doubted . It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs , nor on expertise or specialization ( as in the case of NMPs ) . As a result , the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament . Further , critics question the exact purpose of the scheme . It is unclear as to whether NCMPs serve to represent the minority in the first-past-the post system , or is an apparent representation that would not affect PAP 's decision-making . Nevertheless , it still seems to be a mechanism for representation of the minority opposition . = = = = Nominated Members of Parliament = = = = The NMP scheme was introduced in 1990 and serves to introduce into Parliament alternative , independent and non-partisan views from minorities and experts . This is said to effectively raises the level of political discourse . Women , for example , who are usually under-represented in parliament , may be appointed as an NMP to provide alternate views . A special select committee of Parliament nominates candidates to be appointed as NMPs by the President on the advice of the Cabinet . In 2010 , the number of NMPs was increased from six to nine . NMPs share the same powers and privileges as NCMPs . The NMP scheme was not introduced without controversy , which may lead one to question the effectiveness of the scheme in strengthening representative democracy . Despite the protests of many PAP MPs , the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme . Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits . Further , there may be doubts as to the NMP 's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP , since the NMP bypasses the electoral process . The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP to undercut support for the opposition . On the other hand , NMP Paulin Tay Straughan has argued that NMPs , being non-partisan , do not replace either PAP or opposition MPs . During general elections , Singaporeans still continue to elect MPs who best represent their interests , and NMPs do not feature in the equation . In other words , the NMP scheme has never compromised the democratic process of free elections . = = = = By-elections = = = = A by-election is an election held in between general elections to fill a vacant parliamentary seat . Article 49 of the Constitution states that a vacancy not due to a dissolution of Parliament \" shall be filled by election in the manner provided by or under any law relating to the Parliamentary elections \" . However , when a vacancy arises in a GRC , no election needs to be held unless all the MPs have vacated their seats . The Prime Minister has full discretion with regards to the timing of the by-election and he is not obliged to call a by-election within any fixed timeline . Whether a timeframe should be imposed for the calling of by-elections has been subject to much debate . Several arguments have been advanced by the Government . First , when a voter casts a vote for a candidate , he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of . Thus , once the party has received the voter 's mandate , a vacant seat will not affect this mandate . Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election can be called would be unfair to them . Secondly , the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member , as MPs from other constituencies can help to address the needs of residents in that GRC . However , Thio Li-ann believes that it is undesirable that the law does not impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections . If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant , the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent . This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate . Should the latter situation arise , the rationale behind the GRC scheme \u2013 to guarantee minority representation in Parliament \u2013 would be defeated . In an SMC , only one candidate is elected to represent the constituency in question . Thus , if an SMC parliamentary seat is vacated and the Prime Minister exercises discretion not to call a by-election in the SMC , the constituency 's residents will not only lack a representative in Parliament but will also be without a Town Council chairman . Finally , where an MP of the ruling party vacates his or her seat , a counterpart in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions , thus eliminating the need for a by-election . However , this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called , because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament . Therefore , the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election . = = = Elected President = = = Singapore 's Elected Presidency scheme was created as a constitutional safeguard for the nation 's future to prevent irresponsible governance . Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and moral authority to serve as a check on the executive 's powers . The President 's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore 's past reserves and the preservation of the integrity of the public service . However , the President 's role is custodial and ceremonial \u2013 he does not exercise executive powers . In fact , the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet , or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet , in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law , unless the contrary is expressly provided for . = = = = Stringent eligibility requirements and the Presidential Elections Committee 's role = = = = Thio Li-ann has said that the democratic character of the process for electing the President may be hampered by the application of stringent , elitist criteria , such that it becomes a \" clear obstacle to the unmediated expression of the citizens ' preferences \" . Imposing more stringent criteria for the President than for the Prime Minister appears unreasonable , considering how the Prime Minister 's governing powers are far more substantial than that of the President . Among other things , candidates have to be above 45 years of age and must either presently hold or in the past have held high public office or directorships in private sector companies with paid-up capitals of at least S $ 100 million . It has been estimated that \" only just over 400 people have the necessary financial or administrative experience to qualify as spelt out in the constitution \" . These onerous qualifying criteria have greatly reduced the pool of candidates , and have been criticized as \" technocratic rather than democratic \" . In response to the criticisms , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong argued that the qualification process is necessary and was \" carefully designed to ensure that the electorate is presented with qualified candidates \" . The Prime Minister asserted it would be \" reckless \" to adopt less stringent criteria , though such criteria can be \" refined further over time \" . Potential presidential candidates are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ( \" PEC \" ) . The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny a certificate of eligibility . Its decision is not subject to legal or political scrutiny , and its verdict is final . There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan , who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election , was denied a certificate of eligibility . Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter , he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character . Subsequently , Kuan was denied a certificate , the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation 's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $ 100 million , as required by the Constitution . There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates , and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story . As a result , the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term . Possible reforms might be for prospective candidates to have the right to publicly respond to negative accusations before the PEC , and for the PEC to be more transparent with regard to the reasons for their decisions concerning the eligibility of candidates . A more democratized process open to public scrutiny would give citizens a role to play , thus enhancing the notion of representative democracy . = = = = Uncontested elections = = = = After Ong Teng Cheong , the first Elected President , had stepped down , the subsequent presidential elections in 1999 and 2005 were uncontested , and S.R. Nathan was deemed to have been elected unopposed for two consecutive terms . Thio has commented : The right to vote in competitive elections is integral to a functioning democracy and its underlying principles of representation , participation , and legitimacy . Unfortunately , the phenomenon of election by default , a regular feature of Singapore 's parliamentary and presidential elections , only harms the practice of democracy . She has suggested that to ensure that the institution of the Elected President continues to be legitimate , even if there is only one candidate in an election a vote should be held , and the candidate only declared elected if he or she receives at least a specified percentage of votes . = = = Prime Minister and the Cabinet = = = Singapore 's Prime Minister is the Head of the Government of Singapore . The President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who , in his judgment , is likely to command the confidence of a majority of the MPs . This is a power that the President exercises in his personal discretion . The President then acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister to appoint other Ministers from among the Members of Parliament . These Ministers , together with the Prime Minister , form the Cabinet . The Cabinet has the general direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament . This scheme can be seen as a mechanism for representation . First , MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament . Secondly , the Prime Minister , who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs , and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs , effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government . The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation . = = Role of the judiciary = = = = = Appointment and independence of judges = = = Article 93 of the Constitution vests judicial power in the judiciary . Rather than being elected , the Chief Justice , Judges of Appeal , and the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President if he , acting in his discretion , concurs with the advice of the Prime Minister . In the Subordinate Courts , district judges and magistrates are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Chief Justice . The idea of the rule of the majority means that people should only be governed by laws passed by their elected representatives . Thus , unelected judges influencing the laws that govern people through the making of decisions seems incompatible with the idea of representative democracy . It has also been said that a judicial \" last word \" would put the judiciary at odds with Parliament , as the judiciary is not directly accountable to the people . However , even though the appointment of judges is counter-majoritarian in nature , this does not mean that the concept of representative democracy is undermined , as it appears that a counter-majoritarian judiciary more effectively upholds the Constitution and the concept of representative democracy . Because of this vital responsibility that the judiciary has , it is important that the judiciary is independent of the political branches of government . As Alexander Hamilton put it : \" The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution \" . Singapore 's judiciary , however , has been criticized as lacking independence and impartiality . According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers , the criticisms involving judicial bias \" could have stemmed from the very high number of cases won by the government or members of the ruling party in either contempt or defamation suits brought against government critics , whether media or individual \" . The Government is alleged to have used the judiciary as a tool to deluge their political opponents like J.B. Jeyaretnam , Tang Liang Hong and Dr. Chee Soon Juan with litigation , in some cases causing bankruptcy and , eventually , removal from the political scene . In a 2008 report , the International Bar Association Human Rights Institute ( \" IBAHRI \" ) claimed that the \" slim likelihood \" of a successful defence to defamation , combined with high damages awarded in cases involving PAP officials , \" sheds doubt on the independence of the judiciary in these cases \" . Allegations of this nature have previously been denied in parliamentary debates , and the Ministry of Law has said the IBAHRI 's allegation that there are reasons to worry about the executive 's influence over judicial decision-making is not supported by evidence . In 2000 , Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew noted that \" [ o ] ur judiciary and the rule of law are rated by WEF [ World Economic Forum ] , IMD [ International Institute for Management Development ] and PERC [ Political and Economic Risk Consultancy ] as the best in Asia \" . = = = Upholding the Constitution = = = The Constitution embodies the idea of representative democracy , as it provides for alternative voices and minority representation in Parliament through the GRC , NCMP and NMP schemes . The Chief Justice of Canada , Beverley McLachlin , has commented that democracy itself is a lot more complicated than elected persons making law . Democracy not only requires majority rule , but rule that protects individuals and groups of individuals whilst promoting fairness . As Martin Taylor puts it : As our understanding of the nature of modern democratic government improves , it becomes increasingly apparent that majority rule , while an essential ingredient of the system , can operate in ways which are as undemocratic as the rule of the minority \u2013 that democracy has to do not only with who exercises the power of the state , by and for the people , but also with the manner in which the state treats those who seek its assistance , or are obliged to submit to its authority , and with what the state allows people to decide and do of , by and for themselves . \" Majority rule \" must be subject to limits , as an elected government may still pass or be tempted to pass unconstitutional and undemocratic laws , such as laws affecting fundamental liberties guaranteed by constitutions . The Singapore Constitution provides safeguards against such behaviour by the majority , and prescribes limits to their powers in the form of , among other things , the fundamental liberties in Part IV of the document . The courts have asserted that the judiciary thus has the power and duty to ensure the observance of constitutional provisions , and is also responsible for declaring invalid any exercise of legislative power exceeding the limits conferred by the Constitution , or contravening any prohibition that the Constitution provides . Supreme Court judges take an oath to defend and protect the Constitution before assuming office . This is done through judicial review , where the judiciary prevents the Parliament from enforcing unconstitutional laws by striking down such laws . Thus , the judiciary essentially upholds the idea of representative democracy that the Constitution embodies when playing its counter-majoritarian role of serving as a check on Parliament and a \" Protector of the Individual \" . = = = Purposive interpretation of statutes = = = A key idea of democracy is that \" people may consent to be governed by laws made by ... democratically elected representatives \" . Judges are required to interpret statutes in a manner that gives \" effect to the intent and will of Parliament \" . By interpreting statutes according to Parliament 's intention , the judiciary upholds the notion of representative democracy as it makes sure that the people are ruled accurately by the laws made by their elected leaders . Thus , the role of judges in interpretation is essential to democracy . Judges are required to interpret laws in the light of section 9A ( 1 ) of the Interpretation Act , which requires an interpretation that would \" promote the purpose or object \" underlying written law is to be \" preferred \" over an interpretation that would not , thus mandating a purposive interpretation . The Interpretation Act provides for the types of extrinsic materials and the circumstances under which such extrinsic materials can be referred to , to aid judges in determining the purpose of the statute . Thus , when determining the purpose of a statutory provision , a judge can refer to relevant extrinsic materials such as the explanatory statement relating to the bill in which the provision appears and the speech made in Parliament by a minister moving a motion for the second reading of the bill , when circumstances call for it . The view has been taken that judges may assign meaning to vague constitutional provisions or statutes on the basis of their own ideological preferences , hence disregarding Parliament 's intention . This criticism arguably does not suggest the need to abandon interpretation by reference to the legislature 's intention , but serves to highlight the importance of the need to use the power of interpretation in an appropriate manner . = = Freedom of speech and expression = = Democracy essentially means rule of the people . To build a democratic society and rule , there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate . The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial for the formation of public opinion on political questions , and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth . In Singapore , the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution , though it is subject to many qualifications . Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore , friendly relations with other countries , public order or morality , and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence . = = = Role in a representative democracy = = = Upholding the concept of representative democracy requires the protection of freedom of expression . This paves the way for discussion of the state of affairs in the country , as expressed by representatives of the people , which include members of the ruling party elected into government as well as opposition politicians . Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the acknowledgement of current weaknesses or limitations . This is justified in the name of public interest as the legislature , administration and governmental institutions will then strive to make improvements . Restricting speech inevitably prevents ascertainment and publication of true facts and accurate judgments \u2013 it entails an unwarranted \" assumption of infallibility \" on the part of the government . As argued by John Stuart Mill and analysed by Eric Barendt , allowing freedom of speech ensures that the government 's policies are right and appropriate to legislate ; even the possibility of false speech should not prevent genuine expression of true beliefs . Nevertheless , since inflammatory speech that may provoke disorder must be prevented , a government should be entitled to prioritize public order considerations over permitting individuals to express their personal opinions . Balancing the risk of damage and disorder against long-term benefits of uninhibited debate is imperative . = = = Government 's position = = = As society matures , the Singapore Government has taken greater cognizance of educated and informed Singaporeans who place greater value on their rights of expression and call for a less restrictive culture . In 2004 , Lee Hsien Loong , then Deputy Prime Minister , expressed how the Government would be \" increasingly guided by the consensus of views in the community with regards to morality and decency issues \" in a bid to \" pull back from being all things to all citizens \" . However , he emphasized the caveat of \" opening up more choices for citizens , without imposing on the whole of society \" . Civic participation may be engaged through debates on policies and national issues , but criticism which \" scores political points and undermines the government 's standing , whether or not this is intended \" will not be treated lightly . When the opposition criticizes an action or policy , the Government \" necessarily has to rebut or even demolish them , so not to lose its moral authority \" . In a parliamentary speech on 28 February 2008 , Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said that the Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression . For instance , in 2000 it had created Speakers ' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches . Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions . All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act . However , freedom of speech and expression , though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed democracy , is not unfettered . The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race or religion , and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held . = = = Mechanisms for the exercise of free speech = = = = = = = Freedom of speech and debate in Parliament = = = = The most direct way of upholding representative democracy is for elected MPs to highlight and address the concerns of the electorate during Parliament sessions . Opposition MPs , NCMPs and NMPs fulfil the important role of representing diverse views and enunciating various needs to the Parliament . At the general election in May 2011 , six opposition MPs from the Workers ' Party of Singapore were elected to Parliament . In section 5 of the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act , enacted pursuant to Article 63 of the Constitution , the freedom of MPs to speak and express themselves in Parliament is provided for in the following terms : There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament , and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court , commission of inquiry , committee of inquiry , tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament . Parliamentary privilege protects contentious views expressed by MPs in the course of parliamentary proceedings in the interest of their constituents or the general public , and thus effectively buoys the right of free speech and expression . Members can speak freely and express themselves frankly in Parliament without fearing legal consequences because they are immune from any civil or criminal proceedings , arrest , imprisonment or damages for what they have said . = = = = Speakers ' Corner = = = = Speakers ' Corner at Hong Lim Park , which was introduced on 1 September 2000 , is a platform for the expression of views in an open-air venue , and was intended to \" liberalise our society , to widen the space for expression and participation \" , as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stated in his National Day Rally speech in 2008 . Most assemblies , demonstrations , exhibitions and speeches organized by Singapore citizens and participated in by only citizens and permanent residents may be held at Speakers ' Corner without the need for any permit under either the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act or the Public Order Act . All that is required is prior registration with the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation before engaging in an event at the venue . However , permits are required if the event concerns matters directly or indirectly relating to any religious belief or religion generally , or which may \" cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore \" ; or involves the display of any banner , film , photograph , placard or poster containing violent , lewd or obscene material . The creation of Speakers ' Corner has been criticized as a governmental concession to free speech which remains fairly restrictive . The number of events staged at the venue has gone down over the years ; this has been attributed to the prevalence of more widespread , effective and convenient communication channels such as television programmes , and the Internet and its online fora . In the words of Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong , Speakers ' Corner has been \" playing the same role as envisaged \u2013 mostly dormant but good to have \" . = = = = New media = = = = According to Tan Tarn How , a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies and former journalist , Singapore newspapers \" have a long record of publicly endorsing the PAP-led government 's position \" . Thus , passing through the mainstream media 's filters , news about opposition political parties can end up marginalized or unreported , as compared to updates from the ruling party . Should the media avoid reporting opposition-related events , voters are effectively deprived of making an informed choice . In Castells v. Spain ( 1992 ) , the European Court of Human Rights said : Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders . In particular , it gives politicians the opportunity to reflect and comment on the preoccupations of public opinion ; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society . With the advent of new media , pro-PAP views in mainstream media are countered by websites expressing the views of Internet users which have been omitted from newspapers and television , thus providing additional platforms for expression which are vital in inculcating a more open and democratic society . Moves by politicians to embrace public opinion on unofficial and informal new media platforms also illustrate how freedom of speech and expression is upheld , and , in fact , increasingly encouraged and taken into account in Singapore 's system of representative democracy . More politicians have been engaging citizens through the Internet through social networking websites and online fora . Former Foreign Minister George Yeo has been actively communicating with netizens on the ubiquitous social networking website Facebook , and has amassed many \" friends \" who are interested in local political affairs . His willing and frank engagement was evident in the run-up to Singapore 's 2011 presidential election , as he had initially contemplated contesting for the Elected Presidency after losing his parliamentary seat in the 2011 general elections , though he subsequently decided not to . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong engaged in a web chat with netizens on the People 's Action Party 's Facebook page in May 2011 to answer questions and assuage their concerns . = = = Restrictions on free speech = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution recognizes that certain restrictions on speech and expression are necessary in the public interest . It states that Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression \" as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof , friendly relations with other countries , public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence \" . However , potentially severe restrictions on free speech , some of which are elaborated upon below , may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views . These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld , and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits . = = = = Defamation law = = = = The frequency of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics , in particular political opponents , has been a cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State . Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians . This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially , causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections . The resulting perception is that Singapore 's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views . The Government has denied these claims , citing the lack of substantiating evidence . Noting that many opposition politicians routinely criticize government leaders but are not sued because they have not uttered slanderous falsehoods , it insists that free speech and the right to disagree are upheld , the effects of which are characteristic of a representative democracy . The Government has also pointed out that Singapore 's legal system has won excellent ratings in international surveys . Lee Kuan Yew has also defended the system , asserting that doing things the Government 's way has allowed Singapore to be prosperous , orderly and corruption-free whilst gaining international respect ; and that the \" threat of defamation proceedings may make opposition politicians weigh their words more carefully than they do elsewhere \" . = = = = Public Entertainments and Meetings Act and Public Order Act = = = = Since free speech may be exercised during assemblies and gatherings , Article 14 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Constitution , which guarantees freedom of assembly , is relevant . Prior to October 2009 , the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ( \" PEMA \" ) required a licence to be obtained from the Public Entertainments Licensing Unit ( PELU ) of the Singapore Police Force before talks , discussions or similar events open to the public were held . Holding an event without a licence would result in a fine or imprisonment . Members of opposition parties claimed that PELU acted inconsistently in issuing licences , and that they had been denied licences without reason . The Workers ' Party was fined $ 800 after a dinner event in 1986 , at which the Party 's Secretary-General J.B. Jeyaretnam had given a speech . PELU decreed that since the publicly delivered speech had been unrelated to the festivities , a separate licence from the dinner itself was needed . In addition , the Act exempted public entertainments provided by or under the auspices of the Government , thus allowing MPs from the ruling PAP to speak without a licence in their capacity as grassroots advisors . With effect from 9 October 2009 , PEMA was amended to exclude \" any lecture , talk , address , debate or discussion in any place to which the public or any class of the public has access whether gratuitously or otherwise \" from the definition of public entertainment , with the consequence that a licence is no longer required under this Act for such events . Under the Public Order Act , which introduced this change , a permit must generally be obtained from the Commissioner of Police before any public assembly is held . However , no permit is required for public assemblies held inside buildings or other enclosed premises where the organizers and speakers are all Singapore citizens ; the event does not deal with any matter \" which relates ( directly or indirectly ) to any religious belief or religion , or any matter which may cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore \" ; and the organizer or an authorized agent of the organizer is present at all times . = = = = Media regulation = = = = Both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government . Given how government-linked companies appear to exercise a near monopoly over the mainstream media in Singapore , the view has been taken that the mainstream media take a predominantly pro-PAP stance in their reporting and suppress or disregard the viewpoints of opposition parties . The Government has justified this approach by stressing that the media should play a constructive role in nation-building by adopting and presenting a national perspective on issues . In other words , the media should support the goals of the elected leadership and extol consensus instead of contention to enhance national strength and competitiveness , and thus \" assiduously eschew advancing its own political agenda \" at the expense of straightforward truth . = = = = = Broadcasting and films = = = = = Under the Broadcasting ( Class Licence ) Notification , issued under section 9 of the Broadcasting Act , all Internet content providers such as bloggers are automatically considered to be licensed and must comply with the conditions of the class licence and the Internet Code of Practice issued by the Media Development Authority ( MDA ) . In particular , it is mandatory for an Internet content provider to register with the MDA if it is , or if the Authority thinks that it is , an individual providing any programme about or a body of persons engaged in the \" propagation , promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore , on the World Wide Web through the Internet \" . The MDA can fine a licensee , or suspend or cancel its licence , if it has breached the terms of its licence , any relevant code of practice issued by the Authority , any provisions of the Broadcasting Act , or any direction issued by the Authority or the Minister for Communications and Information . In addition , it is an offence to provide a broadcasting service without a licence , and a convicted person is liable to a fine of up to $ 200,000 , jail of up to three years , or both . If the offence continues after conviction , a further fine of up to $ 10,000 per day may be imposed . The Minister may declare that any foreign broadcasting service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been \" engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore \" . Rebroadcasting such a \" declared foreign broadcasting service \" is prohibited without the Minister 's approval , which can be refused , revoked without reasons , or granted on conditions , which may include restrictions on the number of people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods . Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $ 100,000 . It is an offence under section 33 of the Films Act to distribute , import , make , reproduce , or exhibit or possess for exhibition any \" party political film \" . A party political film is one that is \" an advertisement made by or on behalf of any political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore , or any branch of such party or body \" , or a film that is \" directed towards any political end in Singapore \" . The latter phrase is defined in the Act as follows : ... [ A ] film is directed towards a political end in Singapore if the film \u2013 ( a ) contains wholly or partly any matter which , in the opinion of the Board [ of Film Censors ] , is intended or likely to affect voting in any election or national referendum in Singapore ; or ( b ) contains wholly or partly references to or comments on any political matter which , in the opinion of the Board , are either partisan or biased ; and \u201c political matter \u201d includes but is not limited to any of the following : ( i ) an election or a national referendum in Singapore ; ( ii ) a candidate or group of candidates in an election ; ( iii ) an issue submitted or otherwise before electors in an election or a national referendum in Singapore ; ( iv ) the Government or a previous Government or the opposition to the Government or previous Government ; ( v ) a Member of Parliament ; ( vi ) a current policy of the Government or an issue of public controversy in Singapore ; or ( vii ) a political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore , or any branch of such party or body . However , the following types of films are not considered to be party political films : ( a ) a film which is made solely for the purpose of reporting of news by a broadcasting service licensed under any written law ; ( b ) a film which is made solely for the purpose of informing or educating persons on the procedures and polling times for any election or national referendum in Singapore ; ( c ) a film which records live the whole or a material proportion of any performance , assembly of persons or procession that is held in accordance with the law and that does not depict any event , person or situation in a dramatic way ; ( d ) a film designed to provide a record of an event or occasion that is held in accordance with the law for those who took part in the event or occasion or are connected with those who did so ; ( e ) a documentary film without any animation and composed wholly of an accurate account depicting actual events , persons ( deceased or otherwise ) or situations , but not a film \u2013 ( i ) wholly or substantially based on unscripted or \u201c reality \u201d type programmes ; or ( ii ) that depicts those events , persons or situations in a dramatic way ; ( f ) a film without animation and dramatic elements \u2013 ( i ) composed wholly of a political party \u2019 s manifesto or declaration of policies or ideology on the basis of which candidates authorised by the political party to stand will seek to be elected at a parliamentary election ; and ( ii ) made by or on behalf of that political party ; and ( g ) a film without animation and dramatic elements \u2013 ( i ) composed wholly of a candidate \u2019 s declaration of policies or ideology on the basis of which the candidate will seek to be elected at a parliamentary or presidential election ; and ( ii ) made by or on behalf of that candidate . = = = = = Newspapers = = = = = The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act ( \" NPPA \" ) generally imposes curbs on the foreign ownership of newspaper companies , and requires a permit to be obtained for the publication , sale and distribution of newspapers . It also enables the Minister for Communications and Information to restrict the circulation of any foreign newspaper that has been declared to be \" engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore \" . In February 1987 , such a declaration was made against The Asian Wall Street Journal and its circulation was limited to 400 copies . The newspaper 's publisher , Dow Jones Publishing Co . ( Asia ) Inc . , unsuccessfully challenged the decision before the High Court and the Court of Appeal . The Court of Appeal interpreted the term domestic politics broadly , holding that in Singapore 's context it included : ... the political system of Singapore and the political ideology underpinning it , the public institutions that are a manifestation of the system and the policies of the government of the day that give life to the political system . In other words , the domestic politics of Singapore relate to the multitude of issues concerning how Singapore should be governed in the interest and for the welfare of its people . In a September 2011 statement , the Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts justified the NPPA 's existence , stating : \" The various safeguards provided for in the NPPA help to ensure that the media operating in Singapore play a responsible role and that publishers are accountable for the content they publish . The safeguards also prevent local newspapers from being manipulated by foreign interests which can have a divisive effect on social cohesion . These considerations are still valid today . Journalistic freedom to report responsibly has not been compromised . \" = = = = = Publications = = = = = Under the Internal Security Act , the Minister for Communications and Information is empowered to prohibit the printing , publication , sale , issue , circulation or possession of any document or publication on the ground , among others , that it is prejudicial to the national interest , public order or security of Singapore . Doing any of the above acts in relation to a banned publication is a criminal offence . Among the publications that have been interdicted under this Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong , and the Russian political newspaper Pravda . A similar power to prohibit the importation , sale or circulation of publications that are considered to be contrary to the public interest exists under the Undesirable Publications Act . = = = = = Election advertising = = = = = Advertising on the Internet was liberalized by the Government in time for the 2011 general elections .

First , during the election period \u2013 that is , the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day \u2013 political parties , candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates ' campaigns , including using websites , chat rooms or discussion forums , video and photograph sharing or hosting websites , e-mail , micro-blog posts ( such as Twitter ) , SMS and MMS messages , digital audio and video files , electronic media applications , and blogs and social networking services ( such as Facebook ) . Election advertising sent by e-mail , micro-blog post , SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender . However , the Internet may not be used to publish the following : Election surveys , defined as opinion surveys of how electors will vote at an election , or of the preferences of electors concerning any candidate or group of candidates or any political party or issue with which an identifiable candidate or group of candidates is associated at an election . Appeals for money or other property in association with a representation that it will be applied for the objects or activities of any political party or for the promotion of any candidate or group of candidates . Any facility enabling members of the public to search for unlawful election advertising . Party political films not permitted by the Films Act . Secondly , when candidates wish to publish election advertising on the Internet during the campaign period \u2013 that is , the period from the closure of the place of nomination on nomination day after the election is adjourned to enable a poll to be taken , to the start of the eve of polling day \u2013 they must provide to the returning officer , within 12 hours after the start of the period , declarations containing information on all the online platforms the advertising has appeared on in that time . Subsequently , a similar declaration must be provided before election advertising is published on such platforms . Individuals who are Singapore citizens may publish on the Internet material that amounts to election advertising without having to comply with the above regulations so long as they do so personally and not at the direction of another person or on that person 's behalf , and do not receive any benefit for doing so . During presidential elections , candidates may advertise on the Internet except on the eve of polling day and polling day itself . However , on those days , it remains legal for people to convey their own political views on a non-commercial basis to others by telephonic or electronic transmission , and election advertising may remain unaltered on the Internet if it was lawfully published before the eve of polling day . = = Other controversies relating to representative democracy = = Over the years , the Government has been accused of slowing down the progress of democracy by using the Internal Security Act to detain political opponents and suppress political criticism and dissent by organizations such as the Asian Legal Resource Centre and Human Rights Watch . A similar allegation was made by presidential election candidate Tan Jee Say in 2011 . Conversely , the Government has repeatedly asserted that \" [ n ] o person has ever been detained only for their political beliefs \" . = = = Legislation = = = Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( 1985 Rev.

                "Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore = Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore , specifically Article 14 ( 1 ) , guarantees to Singapore citizens the rights to freedom of speech and expression , peaceful assembly without arms , and association . However , the enjoyment of these rights may be restricted by laws imposed by the Parliament of Singapore on the grounds stated in Article 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution . There are two types of grounds . For the first type , it must be shown that restricting the rights is \" necessary or expedient in the interest \" of the grounds . The grounds are the security of Singapore and public order ( applicable to all three rights protected by Article 14 ( 1 ) ) , morality ( freedom of speech and freedom of association ) , and friendly relations with other countries ( freedom of speech only ) . In a 2005 judgment , the High Court expressed the view that the phrase necessary or expedient confers upon Parliament \" an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving any of the purposes specified in Art 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution \" . It is unnecessary for the courts to determine whether a legislative restriction of a right is reasonable . All that is required is a nexus between the objective underlying the restrictive law and one of the grounds specified in Article 14 ( 2 ) that Parliament is entitled to restrict the right on . The right to free speech is limited on the ground of the security of Singapore by the Official Secrets Act ( Cap . 213 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , and on the ground of public order by the Broadcasting Act ( Cap . 28 , 2003 Rev. Ed . ) and Newspaper and Printing Presses Act ( Cap . 206 , 2002 Rev. Ed . ) . Public order also justifies restrictions on both free speech and assembly imposed by the Sedition Act ( Cap . 290 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ( Cap . 257 , 2001 Rev. Ed . ) and Public Order Act ( Cap . 257A , 2012 Rev. Ed . ) ; and restrictions on the right to freedom of association imposed by the Societies Act ( Cap . 311 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) . Freedom of speech has also been limited on the basis of morality by the Films Act ( Cap . 107 , 1998 Rev. Ed . ) , which establishes film censorship and classification regimes ; and the Undesirable Publications Act ( Cap . 338 , 1998 Rev. Ed . ) , under which obscene or otherwise objectionable publications may be banned . No necessity or expedience requirement applies to the second type of grounds , which appear in Articles 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) ( restrictions \" designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence \" ) and 14 ( 3 ) ( laws relating to labour or education ) . At present , it appears that Parliament may restrict Article 14 ( 1 ) rights on these grounds simply by enacting legislation , and that the courts are not entitled to assess if the restrictions are appropriate . The privileges of Parliament are set out in the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act ( Cap . 217 , 2000 Rev. Ed . ) , and the Singapore courts have held that the common law offence of scandalizing the court ( a form of contempt of court ) does not violate Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) . The courts have also determined that the traditional common law rules of the tort of defamation strike a proper balance between free speech and the protection of reputation , and have declined to apply a public figure doctrine or responsible journalism as additional defences to the tort . = = Text of Article 14 = = Article 14 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore was designed to protect the rights to freedom of speech and expression , peaceful assembly without arms , and association . It is subject to Article 14 ( 2 ) which qualifies these rights . Judicial and statutory limits have been read into the Article , a process which is deemed necessary because the rights to free speech , assembly and association do not exist in a vacuum but jostle with competing interests and counter-values . As was said in Chee Siok Chin v. Ministry of Home Affairs ( 2005 ) , \" [ f ] reedom of action invariably ends where conflicting rights and / or interests collide \" . The text of Article 14 , which is entitled \" Freedom of speech , assembly and association \" , is as follows : 14 . \u2014 ( 1 ) Subject to clauses ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) \u2014 ( a ) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression ; ( b ) all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms ; and ( c ) all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations . ( 2 ) Parliament may by law impose \u2014 ( a ) on the rights conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( a ) , such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof , friendly relations with other countries , public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence ; ( b ) on the right conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( b ) , such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof or public order ; and ( c ) on the right conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( c ) , such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof , public order or morality . ( 3 ) Restrictions on the right to form associations conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( c ) may also be imposed by any law relating to labour or education . Articles 14 ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) are in pari materia with Articles 10 ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) of the Constitution of Malaysia , from which they were adopted following Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 . Articles 14 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are also somewhat similar to Articles 19 ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of the Constitution of India . There is no constitutional right to bear arms in Singapore , as Article 14 ( 1 ) ( b ) provides Singapore citizens with \" the right to assemble peaceably and without arms \" . Under the Arms and Explosives Act , no person may possess , import , export , manufacture or deal in any arms or explosives without a licence . It may be that the words and without arms were included in Article 14 ( 1 ) ( b ) to ensure that arguments based on the clause in the English Bill of Rights 1689 stating that \" the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law \" , which inspired the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ( \" A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . \" ) , cannot be raised in Singapore . The freedoms of speech , assembly and association guaranteed by the Constitution are enjoyed only by Singapore citizens . In Review Publishing Co . Ltd. v. Lee Hsien Loong ( 2009 ) , it was held that the appellant newspaper company did not have the requisite locus standi to rely on the constitutional right of free speech and expression as it was not a Singapore citizen , and Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution expressly provides that only Singapore citizens are entitled to the right . = = Restrictions on the rights = = The rights guaranteed to the citizens of Singapore by Article 14 ( 1 ) are subject to restrictions set out in subsection ( 2 ) of the same Article . In Chee Siok Chin , Justice V.K. Rajah elucidated the justification for these qualifications : The right of freedom of expression should never be exercised on the basis that opinions are expressed in hermetically sealed vacuums where only the rights of those who ardently advocate their views matter . That is entirely inappropriate . Freedom of expression when left unchecked may reach a point where protest , criticism and expression culminate in nuisance or something even more serious . The law inevitably has to intervene then . In 1993 in a statement delivered at the World Conference on Human Rights , the Minister for Foreign Affairs Wong Kan Seng took the position that \" order and stability are essential for development \" as economic growth requires a stable legal environment protective of contractual and property rights . Excessive focus on civil-political liberties during the early stages of national development would impair this . However , the Government appears to have loosened restrictions on political liberties like free speech over time to manage demands for a more participatory political culture . In fact , citizens were urged by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong not to be \" passive bystanders in their own fate \" but to debate issues \" with reason , passion and conviction \" . Wrestling with \" honest differences \" was to be preferred over being \" an apathetic society with no view \" . Parliament may impose restrictions on the rights guaranteed by Article 14 ( 1 ) on two types of grounds . For the first type , it must be shown that restricting the rights is \" necessary or expedient in the interest \" of the grounds . No such requirement applies to the second type of grounds , which appear in Articles 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) and 14 ( 3 ) . At present , it appears that Parliament may restrict Article 14 ( 1 ) rights on these grounds simply by enacting legislation , and that the courts are not entitled to assess if the restrictions are appropriate . = = = Meaning of Parliament may by law impose = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution states that \" Parliament may by law impose \" restrictions on the rights referred to in Article 14 ( 1 ) . This is arguably in line with Singapore 's adoption of the Westminster system of government that rests upon parliamentary supremacy , the rule of law and common law principles . The terms law and written law are defined in Article 2 ( 1 ) of the Constitution as follows : In this Constitution , unless it is otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires \u2014 \" law \" includes written law and any legislation of the United Kingdom or other enactment or instrument whatsoever which is in operation in Singapore and the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore and any custom or usage having the force of law in Singapore ; ... \" written law \" means this Constitution and all Acts and Ordinances and subsidiary legislation for the time being in force in Singapore . One reading of Article 14 ( 2 ) is that in order to restrict the rights to freedom of speech , assembly and association , Parliament must impose the restrictions by passing written laws , that is , Acts of Parliament , since it exercises the legislative power of Singapore by passing bills that are assented to by the President . However , in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew ( 1990 ) , a case involving defamation law , the Court of Appeal took a much broader approach . The Court noted that according to Article 2 ( 1 ) , law in Article 14 ( 2 ) includes the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore . In May 1963 , the Parliament of Malaysia had enacted the Malaysia Act 1963 , which extended the Defamation Act 1957 to Singapore , then a state in the Federation of Malaysia . Since the Act , now the Defamation Act ( Cap . 75 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , was premised on common law rules of the tort of defamation , the Court held that the Legislature had \" clearly intended that the common law relating to defamation , as modified by the Act , should continue to apply in Singapore \" . Thus , it is \" manifestly beyond argument that Art 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) is subject to the common law of defamation as modified by the Act \" . It has been said that this argument \" suffers from two fatal flaws \" . There is no evidence that the constitutionality of the existing rules of defamation was considered by either the Malaysian or Singapore Parliaments . More significantly , even if the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore had believed these rules to be constitutional , this should not have been treated by the Court of Appeal as decisive as it is the courts ' duty to independently determine whether the assumption is justified . Otherwise , a similar argument might be extended to all legislation passed by Parliament , and \" [ i ] t is not difficult to see that this would spell the end of constitutional law itself \" . = = = Restrictions premised on necessity or expediency = = = Parliament may restrict the rights to free speech , assembly and association on the grounds set out in the table below if it is \" necessary or expedient in the interest \" of them : In Chee Siok Chin , the High Court interpreted the phrase necessary or expedient as conferring upon Parliament \" an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving any of the purposes specified in Art 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution \" . The Court emphasized the fact that , unlike Article 19 ( 3 ) of the Constitution of India which provides that the right to fetter the freedom of speech and assembly is subject to the touchstone of reasonableness , Singapore 's Article 14 ( 2 ) does not contain the word reasonable . However , despite the broad power that Article 19 ( 3 ) accords to the Indian courts , they have been \" most reluctant \" to invalidate legislation purportedly infringing the rights to free speech or assembly . There exists a strong presumption of legislative constitutionality , as the Supreme Court of India has expressed a need for \" judicial self-restraint and extreme caution \" when determining whether legislation unreasonably restricts a constitutional right . It has been noted that the Indian courts have thus been used to exemplify how much more deference Singapore courts should give to the Government , and that the Article 14 ( 2 ) derogation clause was said to confer upon Parliament a great amount of discretionary power . The High Court also rejected the use of a proportionality analysis when determining the extent of Parliament 's powers to impose restrictions on individual rights . The analysis enables the judiciary to assess if an interference with rights is proportionate to a legitimate and important aim of the legislation in question . A court will inquire into whether relevant and sufficient reasons justify the statutory interference , and may substitute its own judgment for that of Parliament . The High Court concluded : \" Needless to say , the notion of proportionality has never been part of the common law in relation to the judicial review of the exercise of a legislative and / or an administrative power or discretion . Nor has it ever been part of Singapore law . \" Bearing in mind these restraints , the court 's only task is to ascertain whether an impugned law is within the purview of any of the permissible restrictions . Hence , all that needs to be established is a nexus between the object of the law in question and one of the permissible subjects stipulated in Article 14 ( 2 ) . In doing so , the Government must merely satisfy the court that there is a factual basis on which Parliament has considered it \" necessary or expedient \" to restrict one 's individual right to freedom of speech , assembly or association . When determining whether legislative restrictions are \" in the interest of \" the relevant purposes specified in Article 14 ( 2 ) , the courts may examine the impugned statute , relevant parliamentary material and contemporary speeches and documents , and will adopt a \" generous and not a pedantic interpretation \" . Moreover , the term in the interest of , when contrasted with the maintenance of , grants \" a much wider legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach \" and includes \" laws that are not purely designed or crafted for the immediate or direct maintenance \" of the Article 14 ( 2 ) grounds . = = = = Security of Singapore ; friendly relations with other countries = = = = Parliament may restrict the rights to freedom of speech , assembly or association if it is necessary or expedient in the interests of the security of Singapore or any part thereof . The courts have taken a broad approach to this exception , and have shown a considerable amount of deference to the Government . For instance , in Public Prosecutor v. Phua Keng Tong ( 1986 ) , a case involving the Official Secrets Act , the High Court held that security in Article 14 ( 2 ) does not merely mean protection from danger but includes the \" protection of information which the Government considers vital or essential for its administration \" . However , not everything that the Government regards as an official secret will be necessarily be deemed to be so by the court , especially if the information is \" innocuous in nature \" . The burden of proving that official information is secret lies on the Prosecution . Freedom of speech and expression may also be restricted in the interest of friendly relations with other countries . This ground of restriction has not yet been considered by local courts , but might have justified the withdrawal by the Board of Film Censors ( BFC ) of a certificate issued for the film Zoolander ( 2001 ) with effect from 8 February 2002 . The film , a comedy about a male model played by Ben Stiller who is brainwashed into attempting to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia , had earlier been condemned by the Malaysian Film Censorship Board as \" definitely unsuitable \" , though it did not impose a ban as it expected film distributors to exercise discretion . The BFC stated only that the film had been banned \" in view of controversial elements gathered from feedback \" . The ban was lifted at the beginning of 2006 , which enabled the film to be released on DVD . = = = = Public order = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) also empowers Parliament to impose restrictions on the rights guaranteed by all three limbs of Article 14 ( 1 ) on the ground of public order . The term public order has been given an expansive interpretation that highlights the importance which the Singapore Government places upon social stability . In Chee Siok Chin , which dealt with the constitutionality of sections 13A and 13B of the Miscellaneous Offences ( Public Order and Nuisance ) Act the High Court approved the following quotation from V.N. Shukla 's Constitution of India ( 9th ed . , 1994 ) : The expression ' public order ' is synonymous with public peace , safety , and tranquility . It signifies absence of disorder involving breaches of local significance in contradistinction to national upheavals such as revolution , civil strife or war , affecting the security of the State . To illustrate , the State may , in the interests of public order , prohibit and punish the causing of loud and raucous noise in streets and public places by means of sound amplifying instruments ; regulate the hours and place of public discussions and the use of public streets for the purpose of exercising freedom ; provide for expulsion of hecklers from meetings and assemblies ; punish utterances tending to incite breach of the peace or riot and use of threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour in any public place or at any public meeting with intent to cause a breach of the peace or whereby breach of the peace is likely to be caused , and all such acts as would endanger public safety . Such an interpretation is consistent with earlier cases . In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor ( 1994 ) , Chief Justice Yong Pung How considered the term in relation to the right to freedom of religion embodied in Article 15 ( 4 ) of the Constitution and stated : I am of the view that religious beliefs ought to have proper protection , but actions undertaken or flowing from such beliefs must conform with the general law relating to public order and social protection . The right of freedom of religion must be reconciled with \" the right of the State to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace , security and orderly living without which constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery \" ( Commissioner , HRE v LT Swamiar AIR 1954 SC 282 ) . The sovereignty , integrity and unity of Singapore are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the Constitution and anything , including religious beliefs and practices , which tend to run counter to these objectives must be restrained . In Chee Siok Chin it was further clarified that \" the legislative power to circumscribe the rights conferred by Art 14 of the Constitution is , inter alia , delineated by what is ' in the interest of public order ' and not confined to ' the maintenance of public order ' . This is a much wider legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach in the maintenance of public order . This necessarily will include laws that are not purely designed or crafted for the immediate or direct maintenance of public order ... \" . = = = = = Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly = = = = = The Government has power to limit the circulation of local and foreign media in Singapore under the Broadcasting Act and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act ( \" NPPA \" ) . These Acts can be considered as imposing restrictions on free speech based on public order . For instance , the Broadcasting ( Class Licence ) Notification , made under section 9 of the Broadcasting Act , makes it mandatory for an Internet content provider to register with the Media Development Authority ( MDA ) if it is , or if the Authority thinks that it is , an individual providing any programme about or a body of persons engaged in the \" propagation , promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore , on the World Wide Web through the Internet \" . The MDA can fine a licensee , or suspend or cancel its licence , if it has breached the terms of its licence , any relevant code of practice issued by the Authority , any provisions of the Broadcasting Act , or any direction issued by the Authority or the Minister for Information , Communications and the Arts . In addition , it is an offence to provide a broadcasting service without a licence , and a convicted person is liable to a fine of up to S $ 200,000 , jail of up to three years , or both . If the offence continues after conviction , a further fine of up to $ 10,000 per day may be imposed . The Minister may declare that any foreign broadcasting service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been \" engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore \" . Rebroadcasting such a \" declared foreign broadcasting service \" is prohibited without the Minister 's approval , which can be refused , revoked without reasons , or granted on conditions , which may include restrictions on the number of people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods . Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $ 100,000 . Similar provisions exist in the NPPA to enable the circulation of foreign newspapers in Singapore to be restricted . In February 1987 , the Asian Wall Street Journal was declared to have engaged in domestic politics and its circulation was limited to 400 copies . The newspaper 's publisher , Dow Jones Publishing Co . ( Asia ) Inc . , applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for certiorari to quash the Minister 's orders . On appeal to the Court of Appeal , Dow Jones argued that the Minister had acted irrationally and misinterpreted scope of his powers under the NPPA by not considering the right to free speech protected by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) . The Court dismissed the argument on the ground that Dow Jones could not rely on the Article as it only applied to Singapore citizens . Furthermore , even if Dow Jones could raise the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the NPPA on the basis that Singapore citizens were indirectly affected by it , it was not evident that the right to free speech included the right to receive information . In any case , even if the latter argument was accepted , it might be said that the right of Singapore citizens to receive information by reading the Asian Wall Street Journal had not been impaired since 400 copies of it were still in circulation . The Court interpreted the term domestic politics broadly , holding that in Singapore 's context it included : ... the political system of Singapore and the political ideology underpinning it , the public institutions that are a manifestation of the system and the policies of the government of the day that give life to the political system . In other words , the domestic politics of Singapore relate to the multitude of issues concerning how Singapore should be governed in the interest and for the welfare of its people . In addition to empowering the Minister to limit the circulation of foreign newspapers as described above , the NPPA generally imposes curbs on the foreign ownership of newspaper companies , and requires a permit to be obtained for the publication , sale and distribution of newspapers . In a September 2011 statement , the Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts justified the NPPA 's existence , stating : \" The various safeguards provided for in the NPPA help to ensure that the media operating in Singapore play a responsible role and that publishers are accountable for the content they publish . The safeguards also prevent local newspapers from being manipulated by foreign interests which can have a divisive effect on social cohesion . These considerations are still valid today . Journalistic freedom to report responsibly has not been compromised . \" The Sedition Act , Public Entertainments and Meetings Act , and Public Order Act 2009 are statutes which arguably impose restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression , as well as the freedom of assembly , in the interests of public order . The Sedition Act has been used to restrict the propagation of opinions that have a seditious tendency , which includes a tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of Singapore 's population . In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin ( 2005 ) , the accused was convicted under the Act for posting invective and pejorative anti-Muslim remarks on a blog and a forum on the Internet ; and in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong and another ( 2009 ) , a married couple were similarly convicted for distributing religious tracts that were considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims . The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act renders it an offence to provide public entertainment and hold meetings without a licence , and its constitutionality has been upheld before the courts in cases concerning political activities organized by opposition parties . = = = = = Restrictions on the freedom of association = = = = = The right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( c ) is curtailed on public order grounds by the Societies Act . The Act requires all clubs , companies , partnerships and associations of ten or more persons to be registered with the Registrar of Societies unless they are already lawfully registered under other statutes . The Registrar may refuse to register certain specified societies if satisfied that , among other things , they are likely to be used \" for purposes prejudicial to public peace , welfare or good order in Singapore \" ; it would be contrary to the national interest ; or , if the society is a political association , its rules do not require all its members to be Singapore citizens or it is affiliated with some foreign organization that the Registrar considers contrary to the national interest . The list of specified societies includes the following : A society representing , promoting any cause or interest of , or discussing an issue relating to any clan , ethnic group , nationality or religion , or a class of persons defined by reference to their gender or sexual orientation . A political association . A society representing people who advocate , promote or discuss any issue relating to any civil or political right , including animal rights , environmental rights and human rights . A society discussing any matter relating to how Singapore society is governed . Any society that is not registered is deemed to be an unlawful society , and , as regards such a society , being involved in its management , being a member of it , and attending its meetings , are all offences . The Minister for Home Affairs also has power to order that a registered society be dissolved if it appears to him or her that , among other things , it is being used for unlawful purposes or for purposes \" prejudicial to public peace , welfare or good order in Singapore \" . Once an order has been made , the society becomes an unlawful society . On 14 January 1972 , the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses was dissolved , the Minister stating that the existence of the society was prejudicial to public welfare and good order because its members refused to do National Service , which is generally compulsory for male citizens and second-generation permanent residents . An attempt in Chan Hiang Leng Colin to challenge the ban on the grounds of freedom of religion protected by Article 15 ( 1 ) of the Constitution proved unsuccessful . = = = = Morality = = = = Parliament may , under Articles 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) and 14 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Constitution , rely on the ground of morality to impose restrictions on two of the constitutional freedoms embodied in Article 14 : the right to freedom of speech and expression , and the right to freedom of association . There are currently no Singaporean cases which have specifically discussed the meaning of morality . However , legislation such as the Films Act , which establishes film censorship and classification regimes ; and the Undesirable Publications Act , under which obscene or otherwise objectionable publications may be banned , can be regarded as restrictions on free expression pursuant to this ground . In Rathinam Ramesh v. Public Prosecutor ( 2010 ) , where the issue was the sentence that should be imposed on a person convicted of distributing uncertified films contrary to the Films Act , the High Court held that \" the control of film distribution under the Films Act was for the purpose of maintaining public order and morality \" and the accused had not undermined public morality since the films he had been distributing were not obscene . With regard to the issue of censorship , in 2003 the Censorship Review Committee said that \" the responsibility to guide and control will have to be increasingly borne by the individual , the public , particularly parents , and the industry . While the regulator may define and regulate sensitive areas like race and religion , in the areas of morality , the responsibility will have to be devolved to the public and citizen advisory committees . \" In response , the Ministry of Information , Communication and the Arts ( MICA ) stated that the Government \" must continue to remain mindful of the concerns and values of the majority \" . The meaning of morality is therefore dependent on the views of the majority of Singapore citizens , as expressed through public channels and citizen advisory committees . Censorship has therefore been applied to obscene content that \" erodes moral values through pornography , deviant sexual practices , sexual violence , child pornography , bestiality , etc . \" Public morality is not a static idea , but one that evolves with societal norms and values . For example , the MICA has endorsed a \" flexible and contextual approach for homosexual content \" , and has liberalized its censorship of issues such as violence , sexual content and nudity , and coarse language in media . = = = Restrictions not premised on necessity or expediency = = = Unique to Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) is an addendum stating that the right to freedom of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament , or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence . The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds . = = = = Protection of the privileges of Parliament = = = = Article 63 of the Constitution provides for the Legislature to \" determine and regulate the privileges , immunities or powers of Parliament \" by law , and it has done so by enacting the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act . Under the Act , it is a contempt of Parliament to perform certain acts , for instance , to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament ( MP ) coming to or going from Parliament on account of his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament ; or to publish any statement , whether in writing or otherwise , which falsely or scandalously defames , or which reflects on the character of , the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament . It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression . However , there is not yet any case law addressing this provision , and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction . = = = = Contempt of court = = = = = = = = = Constitutionality of the offence of scandalizing the court = = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution provides that Parliament may restrict the right to freedom of speech and expression to provide against contempt of court . One of the more prominent uses of the court 's contempt power has been for the Attorney-General to charge persons with the common law offence of scandalizing the court . The High Court case of Attorney-General v. Wain ( 1991 ) established that by enacting section 8 ( 1 ) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act ( Cap . 322 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) ( now section 7 ( 1 ) of Cap . 322 , 2007 Rev. Ed . ) ( \" SCJA \" ) , which states that \" [ t ] he High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have power to punish for contempt of court \" , Parliament had conferred on these courts the power to act against persons that have scandalized the court . Furthermore , Article 162 could not be relied upon to require that the offence be read down to conform with the right to freedom of speech and expression . Article 162 states : Subject to this Article , all existing laws shall continue in force on and after the commencement of this Constitution and all laws which have not been brought into force by the date of the commencement of this Constitution may , subject as aforesaid , be brought into force on or after its commencement , but all such laws shall , subject to this Article , be construed as from the commencement of this Constitution with such modifications , adaptations , qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with this Constitution . The Court reasoned that Article 162 had no application to the SCJA as the latter was not an existing law at the date of commencement of the Constitution ( that is , 9 August 1965 ) , having been enacted in 1969 . However , the Court did not consider the effect of Article 4 of the Constitution on the offence . That Article states : \" This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall , to the extent of the inconsistency , be void . \" Subsequently , in Attorney-General v. Chee Soon Juan ( 2006 ) , the High Court held that the offence of scandalizing the court could not be regarded as unconstitutional since Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) clearly empowered Parliament to restrict free speech in order to punish acts amounting to contempt of court . Parliament had done so by enacting section 7 ( 1 ) of the SCJA . = = = = = Constitutionality of the elements of the offence = = = = = The classic definition of a contempt by scandalizing the court was enunciated in R. v. Gray ( 1900 ) by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales , Lord Russell of Killowen , who said : \" Any act done or writing published calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt , or to lower his authority , is a contempt of Court . \" Up until Attorney-General v. Shadrake ( 2010 ) , the High Court had adopted an \" inherent tendency \" test to determine liability for the offence . This was in contrast to the \" real risk \" test adopted by many other common law countries . The inherent tendency test was characterized by the act or words complained of possessing an inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice . Moreover , an act or statement would have such an inherent tendency if it conveyed to an average reasonable reader or viewer allegations of bias , lack of impartiality , impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge ( and a fortiori , a court ) in the exercise of his judicial function . In Shadrake , Justice Quentin Loh suggested that the distinction between the tests was in truth illusory . He expressed the view that if it was purely a question of semantics , it would be preferable for the court to adopt the real risk test as it precisely conveys to laymen and lawyers what the law is concerned with . He stated : The [ inherent tendency ] formula has shown itself to be susceptible to controversy and misunderstanding , not least because the literal meaning of inherent tendency tends to obscure the fact that a contextual analysis is actually required . Indeed , given how the word ' inherent ' is commonly understood to indicate something intrinsic , an inherent tendency test would therefore appear to preclude any consideration of extrinsic factors . Holding that \" a publication must post a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice before it is held to be contemptuous \" , Loh J. elucidated the elements of the real risk test as follows : A real risk is not to be equated with a serious or grave risk , but merely something more than a de minimis , remote or fanciful risk . Whether such a real risk is posed is an objective question of fact to be determined in light of all the circumstances of the case . The law is not concerned with the effect of the impugned publication , but the potential effect on public confidence in the administration of justice . Counsel for the respondent had argued that the right to free speech compelled the adoption of the real risk test . However , the Court declined to consider the matter as it had already decided to adopt the test , and since full arguments had not been made on the point . Nonetheless , Loh J. said that the courts had to define the offence \" consistently with the words , structure and spirit of Art 14 , which clearly demand some kind of balance to be struck between the freedom of speech , which is the rule , and the offence of contempt , an exception to the rule . At the very minimum , neither can be defined in such a way that renders the other otiose . \" He noted that the respondent 's counsel had not argued that the offence is inherently unconstitutional , and that a majority of cases had concluded that the real risk test , coupled with a right of fair criticism , is a reasonable limitation on free speech . On appeal , the Court of Appeal in Shadrake v. Attorney-General ( 2011 ) held that the apparent difference between the inherent tendency test and the real risk test was a \" legal red herring \" . However , since the inherent tendency test had caused confusion , it affirmed the High Court 's ruling that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing the court . It felt that trying to elaborate on the meaning of a \" real risk \" was not helpful , and that the court should simply ask itself whether , \" having regard to the facts as well as surrounding context , a ' real risk ' that public confidence in the administration of justice is \u2013 or would be \u2013 undermined as a result of the impugned statement ? \" Although fair criticism has been treated as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases , the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability , though it cautioned that \" the precise characterisation of the concept of fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... . Accordingly , our views on this point must necessarily be taken , to that extent , to be provisional in nature . \" The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof : \" If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability , then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it . The legal burden , on the other hand , would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism , and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice . If , however , the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence , then the legal burden would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism . \" The Court approved the factors set out by the High Court in Attorney-General v. Tan Liang Joo John ( 2009 ) that are relevant in establishing that criticism of the courts is fair : Criticism must be supported by argument and evidence . Criticism must generally be expressed in a temperate and dispassionate manner . This allows rational debate about the issues raised , and thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice . Courts can take into consideration the party 's attitude in court and the number of instances of condemning conduct . In Tan Liang Joo John , Justice Judith Prakash stated that this was not a closed list , and that the court is entitled to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith . She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism \u2013 that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity , propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts . However , she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism . As regards the relationship between the offence of scandalizing the court and the right to free speech , the Court of Appeal commented that : ... the law relating to contempt of court operates against the broader legal canvass [ sic : canvas ] of the right to freedom of speech that is embodied both within Art 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ... as well as the common law . The issue , in the final analysis , is one of balance : just as the law relating to contempt of court ought not to unduly infringe the right to freedom of speech , by the same token , that right is not an absolute one , for its untrammelled abuse would be a negation of the right itself . The Court pointed out that the last mentioned point was embodied in Article 14 ( 2 ) and noted that Parliament had provided the courts with jurisdiction to punish for contempt by enacting section 7 ( 1 ) of the SCJA . It held that the real risk test strikes an appropriate balance between free speech and its abuse , and declined to apply the \" clear and present danger \" test applicable to the First Amendment to the US Constitution as free speech had gained a paramount status in the US quite different from Commonwealth jurisdictions due to the nation 's unique cultural and constitutional heritage . = = = = Defamation = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution also provides Parliament with the power to impose restrictions designed to provide against defamation . The law of defamation thus functions as a restriction on a person 's right to freedom of speech . The law of defamation has its roots in the common law which existed before the enactment of the Constitution in 1965 . As such , the courts must take Article 162 of the Constitution into consideration when deciding whether the common law tort of defamation offends the fundamental liberty of freedom of speech and expression . The Article provides that all existing laws shall continue in force after the commencement of the Constitution subject to \" modifications , adaptations , qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity \" with the Constitution of Singapore . However , in Review Publishing , the Court of Appeal held that the common law of defamation , as modified by the Defamation Act , restricts the right to free speech . The appellants in that case pointed out that the Defamation Ordinance 1960 , which presupposed the existence of the common law of defamation , had been enacted before the 1963 Constitution of the State of Singapore . Thus , it could not have been a law enacted to derogate from the right to free speech guaranteed by Article 10 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia , which became applicable to Singapore when it became a state of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 . The Court disagreed , holding that Article 105 ( 1 ) of the 1963 State Constitution , which was the predecessor of Article 162 , had the effect of re-enacting all laws existing as at 16 September 1963 , including the Defamation Ordinance . Thus Article 105 ( 1 ) itself was an express restriction on the right to free speech . If this was not the case , then when the 1963 State Constitution came into force all laws which restricted Article 10 ( 1 ) of the Federal Constitution would have become unconstitutional , a result which the Court regarded as an \" astonishing conclusion \" . = = = = = Defence of qualified privilege and the public figure doctrine = = = = = Article 14 of the Constitution has been raised as a point of contention in relation to the defence of qualified privilege . The Court of Appeal has discussed the applicability of Article 14 in two cases concerning prominent government figures . In Jeyaratnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew ( 1992 ) , Justice L.P. Thean , when delivering the judgment of the court , held that \" [ p ] ersons holding public office or politicians ... are equally entitled to have their reputations protected as those of any other persons \" . In this case , counsel for the appellant argued that \" qualified privilege attaches to defamatory publications concerning public officials ( or candidates for a public office ) relating to their official conduct or the performance of their public duties by those who have an honest and legitimate interest in the matter to those who have a corresponding and legitimate interest ( whether as electors or as citizens potentially affected by the conduct of public officials ) \" . The fact that the statements were made in a political rally during the run-up to elections meant that the requirement of a legitimate interest was met . Lingens v. Austria ( 1986 ) was relied upon in support of the premise that \" the limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual \" . In Lingens , the European Court of Human Rights was of the opinion that a politician \" inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large , and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance \" . The reasoning of the European Court was in line with the public figure doctrine enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) , where the United States Supreme Court decided in favour of the defendant newspaper , making it one of the key decisions supporting the freedom of the press . However , the Singapore Court of Appeal dismissed the applicability of both cases on the ground that the terms of Article 14 of the Constitution differ materially from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which was relied upon by the court in Lingens ; as well as the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which were relied upon by the court in New York Times . The public figure doctrine was thus expressly rejected by the Court . Thean J. said : \" Such criticisms or attacks must , in our opinion , respect the bounds set by the law of defamation , and we do not accept that the publication of false and defamatory allegations , even in the absence of actual malice on the part of the publisher , should be allowed to pass with impunity . \" To further rebut the presumption that the circumstances of a general election are sufficient to give rise to an occasion of privilege , the Court also relied on section 14 of the Defamation Act which , at the time , provided thus : A defamatory statement published by or on behalf of a candidate in any election to Parliament or other elected or partially elected body shall not be deemed to be published on a privileged occasion on the ground that it is material to a question in issue in the election , whether or not the person by whom it is published is qualified to vote at the election . The court was unwilling to extend the traditional defence of qualified privilege as it was of the opinion that Parliament 's intention in enacting section 14 was clear : it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or on behalf of a candidate for the election is not . The Court of Appeal 's reasoning in Jeyaretnam has been the subject of academic criticism . Michael Hor has criticized the distinction drawn by the Court between Article 14 of the Constitution and its American and European counterparts as overly literal . The current interpretation of the law gives the legislature an unfettered discretion in limiting freedom of speech in Singapore through the enactment and amendment of relevant legislation . Hor opines that : What is instructive and applicable in Singapore is the realisation that it is the constitutional responsibility of the judiciary to ensure that the basic commitment to the freedom of speech is not undermined by giving the Legislature carte blanche to derogate therefrom in either some or all of the specified exceptions . Our courts must assume the task of scrutinising the prevailing rules of defamation to ensure that they strike a justifiable balance between the freedom of speech and the need to protect individual reputation . Hor has also said that the Court 's approach in Jeyaretnam fails to provide adequate safeguards to account for future politicians and holders of public office who may be less than honourable . Moreover , Singapore courts should not start with the assumption that the common law is necessarily constitutional , as this would be tantamount to \" putting the cart before the horse \" . Rather , the Constitution ought to be interpreted consistently with the common law . = = = = = Defence of responsible journalism = = = = = In Review Publishing , Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong , delivering judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal , declined to infer into the common law of Singapore the defence of responsible journalism , or \" Reynolds privilege \" , developed by the House of Lords in Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd . ( 1999 ) , at least where non-Singapore citizens who have been sued for defamation are seeking to rely on it . This was because the defence was not a natural development of common law principles but had been impelled by the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 of the European Convention . The Reynolds privilege could only be adopted in Singapore on the basis of the right to free speech guaranteed by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution . However , as the appellants were not Singapore citizens , they could not rely on this provision . The Court then discussed , on an obiter basis , the applicability of the Reynolds privilege to Singapore citizens . It held that the key question is whether or not , in the context of publication of matters of public interest , the rationale behind the Reynolds privilege ought to apply such that constitutional free speech is the rule and restrictions on this right are the exception . In considering the factors relevant to the key question , Chan C.J. stated that whilst the court has the power to dictate the direction of the common law of defamation as adopted upon the enactment of the Constitution , Parliament still has overriding powers to limit the freedom of speech and expression where defamatory publications and statements are made : First , our courts must be mindful of the extent to which they can decide whether constitutional free speech should prevail over protection of reputation . Although there is nothing in Art 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Singapore Constitution and the Defamation Act which precludes our courts from developing the common law of defamation for the common convenience and welfare of society in keeping with Singapore 's prevailing political , social and cultural values ( save for those provisions in these two statutes which impose such a restriction ) , Art 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) also expressly provides that it is Parliament which has the final say on how the balance between constitutional free speech and protection of reputation should be struck . Secondly , when striking a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of reputation , the court will need to make a value judgment that is dependent on local political and social conditions . The Court said that the following factors were relevant to the making of this value judgment : In its opinion , the balance between constitutional free speech and protection of reputation that has been struck by the current law of defamation in Singapore is appropriate in the circumstances of the present day . Singapore law does not recognize journalistic material that relates to matters of public interest as having any particular importance , and \" there is no room in our political context for the media to engage in investigative journalism which carries with it a political agenda \" . Honesty and integrity in public discourse on matters of public interest , particularly the way the country is governed , are greatly emphasized by the political culture in Singapore . Finally , the Court expressed the view that if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence , another issue that will have to be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests . In this connection , Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation , whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously , or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation . The Chief Justice also suggested that the rationale in the Reynolds case might be given effect by continuing to find the defendant liable for defamation but reducing the amount of damages payable depending on how much care he or she took to ensure the accuracy of the information published . He noted : \" There is no reason why a defendant who has published a defamatory statement should be allowed to get off scot-free for injuring the plaintiff 's reputation simply because he has satisfied the ' responsible journalism ' test . \" = = = = Incitement to any offence = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution provides that the right to freedom of speech and expression may be restricted to provide against incitement to any offence . This ground has not yet been considered in a Singapore case . A number of statutory provisions prohibit incitement . Under section 107 ( a ) of the Penal Code , a person is said to abet the doing of a thing if he or she instigates someone to do that thing . If a person abets an offence , and as a result the act abetted is committed , the person is to be punished with the punishment provided for the offence . If the offence is not committed due to the abetment , and it is punishable by imprisonment , the abettor is to be imprisoned for up to a quarter of the maximum jail term of the offence , or may receive a fine , or both . If either the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant whose duty it was to prevent the offence from happening , the abettor may be imprisoned for up to half of the maximum jail term of the offence , or may be fined , or receive both penalties . However , if the offence abetted but not committed is punishable with death or life imprisonment , the abettor is liable to a penalty of up to seven years ' imprisonment , a fine , or both . If any hurt is caused as a result of the abetment , the abettor may be jailed up to 14 years and must also be fined . Under section 505 ( c ) of the Penal Code , it is an offence to make , publish or circulate any statement , rumour or report in written , electronic or other media with an intent to incite , or which is likely to incite , any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons . The penalty is imprisonment for up to three years , a fine , or both . No offence is committed if the person who made , published or circulated the statement had reasonable grounds for believing it was true , and did not intend to incite one community against another . = = = = Laws relating to labour or education = = = = Article 14 ( 3 ) provides that the right to form associations may also be restricted by any law relating to labour or education . The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations , while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act . Under the Education Act , it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled . Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university 's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies . = = = Other restrictions = = = Under Article 149 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons inside or outside Singapore : to cause , or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear , organized violence against persons or property ; to excite disaffection against the President or the Government ; to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or other classes of the population likely to cause violence ; to procure the alteration , otherwise than by lawful means , of anything by law established ; or which is prejudicial to the security of Singapore , any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action or any amendment to that law is valid even if it is inconsistent with specified fundamental liberties , including the rights to freedom of speech , assembly and association guaranteed by Article 14 .

                "Section Thirty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms = Section 34 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the last section of Canada 's Charter of Rights , which is entrenched in the Constitution Act , 1982 . Section 34 provides guidance for the legal citation of the Charter . The section has been interpreted by Canadian writers , who have analyzed both its intention and its meaning . Because the section affirms the name of the Charter and thus entrenches it in the Constitution Act , it came into focus in 1994 when a Member of Parliament ( MP ) proposed to change the name of the Charter . = = Text = = Under the heading \" Citation , \" the section reads : = = Function = = Section 34 , as part of the Constitution Act , 1982 , came into force on April 17 , 1982 . According to the government of Canada , section 34 's function \" simply \" relates to citation . The section clarifies that the first 34 sections of the Constitution Act , 1982 may be collectively called the \" Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , \" which is an \" official name . \" This would be the name of the English version . The French version of section 34 states \" Titre de la pr\u00e9sente partie : Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . \" In 1982 , constitutional scholar Peter Hogg suggested that the section also clarifies the size and scope of the Charter . Only section 34 and the sections that come before it compose the Charter . The next sections of the Constitution Act , 1982 , including section 35 ( which affirms Aboriginal rights ) and section 36 ( which affirms equalization payments ) , are thus not Charter rights . This is significant , since section 1 of the Constitution Act , 1982 allows for limits on Charter rights , so it cannot apply to sections 35 or 36 . However , this also means that a \" judicial remedy \" under section 24 of the Act is not available for sections 35 or 36 , since section 24 refers only to the Charter . = = Discussion = = Canadian poet George Elliott Clarke once analyzed section 34 , calling it \" bland legalese . \" He wrote it was \" reassuring \" because it was dull , signalling neither fear nor excitement . Thus , it seemed to imply the Charter of Rights was not a radical constitutional change , despite the fact that it was potentially revolutionary for a constitutional monarchy . In considering the name Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , Clarke felt the first word , \" Canadian , \" hinted at Canadian nationalism . He then compared this to the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the United States Bill of Rights , saying that those documents were written by men who had just emerged from conflict and still remembered it , and thus Canada could be duller . However , he noted there was some drama in the Charter in that it was written when there was a threat of Quebec separatism , and section 27 ( multiculturalism ) , section 25 ( Aboriginal rights ) , and section 15 ( 2 ) ( affirmative action ) of the Charter could change the country . In 1994 , the Canadian House of Commons debated changing the name of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the Canadian Charter of Rights , Freedoms and Responsibilities . As Parliamentary Secretary Russell MacLellan pointed out , this would have to be done through a constitutional amendment , particularly to section 34 , since section 34 \" establishes the charter 's title . The charter 's title is thus part of the Constitution . \" MacLellan believed the amending formula needed would be the one requiring the support of seven provincial governments representing at least half of Canada 's population . Edmonton Southwest MP Ian McClelland had suggested the change , believing it to be necessary because \" I felt we were becoming a nation of entitlement . \" MacLellan replied that \" The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is and aspires to be a statement by Canadians about the rights and freedoms which we as Canadians deeply value in our democratic society . \" MacLellan added that section 1 implied a need for responsibilities , so \" It is not necessary to change the title of this charter to emphasize the integral relationship between the individual 's rights and his or her responsibility to the rest of society . \"",
                "Rule of law doctrine in Singapore = In Singapore , the rule of law doctrine has been the topic of considerable disagreement and debate , largely through differing conceptions of the doctrine . These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics , the \" thin \" , or formal , conception and the \" thick \" , or substantive , conception of the rule of law . The thin conception , often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz , advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements , such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective , clear , stable and constitutionally enacted , and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges . While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law , they take the view that this is a matter of substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of the rule of law . On the other hand , the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule , it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights . A thin conception of the rule of law has generally been adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People 's Action Party , as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law . However , a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore . On the other hand , a thick conception of the rule of law that encompasses human rights has been adopted by a number of Government critics , including opposition politicians , and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch , Lawyers ' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project . Some of the key principles associated with the thin conception of the rule of law include judicial independence , natural justice , the availability of judicial review , and the accessibility of justice . Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules , though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence . One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General 's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference . In Singapore , natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept . The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules , and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy . The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry . For those taking a thick conception of the rule of law , the existence of the Internal Security Act ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) ( \" ISA \" ) is widely regarded as a breach of the doctrine . The Act , which provides for detention without trial for people regarded by the executive as a risk to national security , is shielded from unconstitutionality by Article 149 of the Constitution . Although the Court of Appeal held in the 1988 case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs that the courts could review the legality of detentions under the Act , the effect of the case was reversed through amendments to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 . The ISA amendments were determined to be effective by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs in 1989 and 1990 respectively . While the executive 's largely unconstrained discretion to detain under the ISA has been criticized as contrary to the rule of law , the Government has justified the statute as a crucial measure of last resort for preserving security . = = Introduction = = There have been many attempts to define the rule of law . Academics over the years have come up with various formulations and ideas of what the doctrine should mean . The range of views can roughly be divided into two categories : the \" thin \" , or formal , conception and the \" thick \" , or substantive , conception of the rule of law . = = = Thin conception of the rule of law = = = The \" thin \" conception rule of law advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements . People who subscribe to the thin conception are not apathetic towards the content of the law . However , as Ronald Dworkin says , \" [ t ] hey say that this is a matter of substantive justice , and that substantive justice is an independent ideal , in no sense part of the ideal of the rule of law \" . The thin conception of the rule of law is often associated with two academics , Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz . According to Dicey , the rule of law may be regarded from three points of view : The absolute supremacy of regular law \u2013 a person is to be judged by a fixed set of rules and punished for breaching only the law , and is not to be subject to \" the exercise by persons in authority of wide , arbitrary , or discretionary powers of constraint \" . \" Legal equality \" , that is , \" the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts \" . The fact that the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land . In other words , it is not the source but the consequence of the citizens ' rights . Raz expressed a similar view . Expanding on the concept in a 1977 article , he said that , in its broadest sense , the rule of law means that people should obey the law and be ruled by it . On the other hand , a narrower construction of the rule of law means that the government shall be ruled by and subjected to the law . The doctrine of the rule of law also requires that \" the making of particular laws should be guided by open and relatively stable general rules \" . If the law is to be obeyed , it \" must be capable of guiding the behaviour of its subjects \" , in that people can find out what the law is and act accordingly . A number of important principles spring from the basic idea of the rule of law . These may be divided into two groups : principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects ' behaviour , and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law . Principles ensuring the law is capable of guiding behaviour . Laws should be \" prospective , open and clear \" . The meaning of the law should not be \" ambiguous , vague , obscure or imprecise \" , and the law must be sufficiently publicized . Furthermore , laws should generally not be retroactive ; but if a retroactive law is to be enacted , the fact that this is going to be done must be known for certain to ensure that the retroactivity does not clash with the rule of law . Laws should be relatively stable and not changed too often , as with frequently changing laws it may be hard for people to keep themselves updated . People need to know what the law is both for short- and long-term planning . The making of particular or specific laws should be \" guided by open , stable , clear and general rules \" that create a stable framework . There are two types of general rules : those which empower authorities to make orders , and those which provide guidelines for the proper exercise of such powers . Principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law . Judicial independence is essential . It would be futile for people to approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law independently . Moreover , people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly . Natural justice must be adhered to . For the law to be applied correctly , requirements such as an open and fair hearing and an absence of bias are essential . Courts must have the power to review primary and subsidiary legislation , and administrative action . The courts should be accessible , since if cases are delayed for long periods , legal costs are prohibitive , and so on , this may \" effectively turn the most enlightened law to a dead letter and frustrate one 's ability effectively to guide oneself by the law \" . Although crime-preventing agencies such as the police and prosecuting authorities must have some discretion to act , they should not be allowed to \" pervert the law \" . For example , the police should not be allowed to decide to stop investigating , nor the prosecution be allowed to choose not to prosecute , certain crimes or certain categories of offenders . In Raz 's view , one of the virtues of the rule of law is the restraint it imposes on authorities . It aims to exclude arbitrary power as it is said that most of the exercises of arbitrary power violate the rule of law . Arbitrary power is excluded when courts hold themselves accountable only to the law and observe \" fairly strict procedures \" . Another virtue is the protection it accords to individual freedom , namely , \" the sense of freedom in which it is identified with an effective ability to choose between as many options as possible \" . Most importantly , to adhere to the rule of law is to respect human dignity by \" treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future \" . Raz also identified some of the potential pitfalls of the rule of law . He opined that as the rule of law is designed \" to minimise the harm to freedom and dignity which the law may cause in its pursuit of its goals however laudable these may be \" , the strict pursuit of the rule of law may prevent one from achieving certain social goals which may be preferable to the rule of law : \" Sacrificing too many social goals on the altar of the rule of law may make the law barren and empty \" . = = = Thick conception of the rule of law = = = At the other extreme , the \" thick \" rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule , it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights . Ronald Dworkin , one of the leading scholars advocating the thick conception of the rule of law , defines what he terms the \" rights conception \" of the rule of law as follows : It assumes that citizens have moral rights and duties with respect to one another , and political rights against the state as a whole . It insists that these moral and political rights be recognized in positive law , so that they may be enforced upon the demand of individual citizens through courts or other judicial institutions of the familiar type , so far as this is practicable . The rule of law on this conception is the ideal of rule by an accurate public conception of individual rights . It does not distinguish , as the rule book conception does , between the rule of law and substantive justice ; on the contrary it requires , as part of the ideal of law , that the rules in the book capture and enforce moral rights . Paul Craig , in analysing Dworkin 's view , drew three conclusions . First , Dworkin rejects the need to distinguish between \" legal \" rules and a more complete political philosophy , since the rule of law is basically the theory of law and adjudication that he believes is correct . Secondly , the rule of law is not simply the thin or formal rule of law ; the latter forms part of Dworkin 's theory of law and adjudication . Thirdly , since taking a substantive view of the rule of law requires choosing what the best theory of justice is , it is necessary to articulate particular conceptions of what liberty , equality and other freedoms require . = = Conceptions of the rule of law taken in Singapore = = = = = Thin conception = = = On 24 November 1999 , Non-constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam moved the following motion in Parliament : \" That this House recognises the importance of the Rule of Law and urges the government to ensure the complete and full compliance of the Rule of Law by all Ministers , officials and public servants . \" During the ensuing debate , the Members of Parliament ( MPs ) from the ruling People 's Action Party tended to adhere to a thinner , or more formal , conception of the rule of law . For instance , the Minister of State for Law Ho Peng Kee said : In short , the Rule of Law refers to the supremacy of law , as opposed to the arbitrary exercise of power . The other key tenet is that everyone is equal before the law . The concept also includes the notions of the transparency , openness and prospective application of our laws , observation of the principles of natural justice , independence of the Judiciary and judicial review of administrative action . Chin Tet Yung , an MP for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency , commented that the rule of law required that : ... [ a ] ll laws are prospective , stable , properly and constitutionally enacted . The application of laws , the making of legal orders by public officers should be guided by clear and general rules , that is , avoiding any personal bias or favour , treating equal cases equally , making decisions rationally and in the public interest , and in accordance with the written laws of the land . ... In this particular principle where you have laws , obviously such laws must be applied and obviously the laws are applied by public officers who make legal orders . If these legal orders are substantiated by subsidiary legislation , if this subsidiary legislation is sanctioned by parent Acts , by the primary legislation , then any order issuing from it would be legitimate and would comply with the Rule of Law . And , if anyone is unhappy with that , there is always the next aspect or principle of the Rule of Law , and that is , that the judiciary has the power and the authority to review any administrative action . So that is the third principle . The final principle ... is that the judiciary must be independent and the courts should be generally accessible to all who seek recourse to them . Chin moved an amendment to the motion introduced by Jeyaretnam so that it read : \" That this House ( 1 ) values the importance of the Rule of Law ; and ( 2 ) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all . \" The amendment motion was eventually voted on and agreed to by a majority of MPs in Parliament . In a speech made on 27 October 2009 at a plenary session entitled Singapore and the Rule of Law at the seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore , Minister for Law K. Shanmugam said that he would not try to define the rule of law comprehensively or analyse it from an academic viewpoint , but , practically speaking , the key aspects of a society based on the rule of law are the following : Exercise of State power should be through laws that are publicly known and enacted legitimately . There should be independent , credible Courts to apply the law and decide on disputes between individuals , as well as between individuals and the State . There must be Separation of Powers . No person should be above the law . That should apply in equal measure to the Government and officials as much as it does to everyone else . There should be credible and effective means for people to challenge the arbitrary exercise of power . However , evincing a thicker conception of the rule of law , he added that most people accepted two additional elements \" as being part of how a modern civilised society should be structured \" , though he felt it was \" debatable whether they are part of a strict definition of Rule of Law \" . These elements were that \" [ t ] he people must have the sovereign right to elect their Government \" , and that \" laws must not offend that society 's norms of fairness and justice \" . = = = Thick conception = = = A number of critics of the Government of Singapore have adopted a thick , or substantive , conception of the rule of law that encompasses the protection of human rights . In a chapter entitled \" Rights and the Rule of Law \" in his 1994 book Dare to Change , Singapore Democratic Party ( SDP ) member ( and later Secretary-General ) Chee Soon Juan criticized , among other things , the Government 's use of the Internal Security Act ( \" ISA \" ) to detain persons without trial , and the lack of freedom of speech and assembly . In an open letter published on the SDP website dated 6 January 2009 which was addressed to the Chief Justice , Attorney-General and Law Minister , he said : \" [ T ] he rule of law is not just a system where the government passes legislation and everyone unquestioningly obeys . The concept of the rule of law necessitates the limitation of state power and the respect of human rights . Our Constitution spells out what these limitations are . It also defines the rights of the citizen . \" And in a speech delivered to the International Bar Association Conference in Dubai on 4 November 2011 , he cited a free media and the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly as essential elements of the rule of law . During the 24 November 1999 Parliamentary debate on the rule of law , Jeyaretnam traced the doctrine to the Magna Carta , and said that it was to be found in the Constitution of Singapore , particularly in Article 9 and Article 12 , which respectively protect the rights to life and personal liberty , and equality rights . He also noted that in the court judgment Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1980 ) , the Privy Council had held that in phrases such as \" in accordance with law \" and \" equality before the law \" in the Constitution , the term law does not only mean Acts passed by Parliament , but also includes the fundamental rules of natural justice that have been accepted and become part and parcel of the common law . He then cited eight instances of the Government 's alleged non-compliance with the rule of law , including detention without trial under , inter alia , the ISA and the Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions ) Act ( \" CLTPA \" ) ; denial of the right of arrested persons to counsel and to visits from their families for a period of time ; denial of the rights to freedom of speech and assembly ; and the tendency of the executive not to provide reasons for decisions made . Opposition MP Chiam See Tong complained that the Government had not treated opposition parties fairly as regards applications for licences for events . Criticisms about the ISA and the state of freedom of speech and assembly in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations . A 2007 report by Lawyers ' Rights Watch Canada , Rule of Law in Singapore , alleged that defamation and bankruptcy law had been used to oppress the political opposition , and expressed concern about stringent limits on the freedom of assembly and detention under the ISA . In its Rule of Law Index 2011 , the World Justice Project defined the rule of law as \" a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld \" : The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law . The laws are clear , publicized , stable , and fair , and protect fundamental rights , including the security of persons and property . The process by which the laws are enacted , administered , and enforced is accessible , fair , and efficient . Access to justice is provided by competent , independent , and ethical adjudicators , attorneys or representatives , and judicial officers who are of sufficient number , have adequate resources , and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve . [ Emphasis added . ] Singapore was ranked highly on factors such as order and security ( with a ranking of 2 out of the 66 countries assessed ) , absence of corruption ( 4 / 66 ) , and effective criminal justice ( 5 / 66 ) , but less highly on open government ( 19 / 66 ) , limited government powers ( 20 / 66 ) and fundamental rights ( 39 / 66 ) . In particular , the Index noted that \" [ n ] otwithstanding the country 's outstanding performance in most categories , there are substantial limitations on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly , with Singapore in 49th and 60th place , respectively , out of all 66 countries \" . The Human Rights Watch Singapore : Country Summary of January 2012 commented negatively on restrictions on the rights to free speech , assembly and association , such as limitations on print , broadcast and online media , and outdoor gatherings ; contempt of court proceedings against Alan Shadrake ; and the gazetting of The Online Citizen blog as a \" political association \" , thus preventing it from receiving foreign funding . It also criticized the existence of the ISA and CLTPA , the use of caning as a punishment , and the continued criminalization of sexual acts between consenting men under section 377A of the Penal Code . The Ministry of Law described the report as \" inaccurate \" and containing \" false assertions \" . = = Compliance with rule of law principles in Singapore = = = = = Principles associated with the thin conception = = = = = = = Judicial independence = = = = Raz identified judicial independence as one of the essential principles of the rule of law . In this context , judicial independence refers to the judiciary 's independence from the legislative and executive branches of the government . Singapore 's judiciary enjoys a certain measure of independence provided by various constitutional safeguards such as security of tenure and remuneration . Judges are also relatively free from executive and legislative influence . A retired Supreme Court judge , L.P. Thean , has said that it is theoretically possible for the executive to make political appointments to the Bench , to reduce a judge 's remuneration by amending the Constitution , or to take away the judiciary 's vital support staff , but \" [ t ] he fact remains , however , that nothing of that kind has ever been done \" . Various provisions of the Constitution guarantee the independence of the Supreme Court judiciary . Since Article 93 vests judicial power exclusively in the courts , judicial power is to be solely exercised by the judiciary and not by the executive or legislature , thus reflecting the former 's independence from the other branches of government . Article 94 ensures that the office of a Supreme Court Judge will \" not be abolished during his continuance in office \" , while Article 98 provides for judges ' security of tenure until the age of 65 years , barring misbehaviour , inability , infirmity of body or mind , or any other cause that prevents judges from properly discharging the functions of their office . A judge may only be removed from office on these grounds by the President on the advice of a tribunal of judges of the Supreme Court or those who hold or have held equivalent offices in the Commonwealth . Article 98 also provides that the remuneration and other terms of office of Supreme Court judges may not be altered to their disadvantage following their appointment . Article 99 restricts parliamentary debate on the conduct of a Supreme Court judge unless on a substantive motion supported by at least a quarter of all MPs . However , it has been argued by some commentators that Singapore falls short where some aspects of judicial independence are concerned . For instance , Supreme Court judges above the age of 65 may be reappointed on a term basis . It has been suggested that this may result in \" the unsavoury possibility of judges being ' beholden ' to the executive \" . This point was also raised by Jeyaretnam in Parliament in 1986 with respect to the then Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin . However , an academic has pointed out that removing entirely the system of extensions may not serve the larger interest at the end of the day if excellent judges have to retire due to the mandatory requirement . Judges of the Subordinate Courts do not enjoy the security of tenure enjoyed by the Supreme Court judges . As officers of the Singapore Legal Service , it is said that there is a risk of executive interference because judges may be removed from their judicial positions or transferred to lower-ranking positions elsewhere within the Legal Service by the Legal Service Commission ( LSC ) . In 1984 , the Senior District Judge Michael Khoo acquitted Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaratnam of all but one minor charge in a case involving cheques for the Workers ' Party of Singapore which had allegedly been fraudulently handled . The acquittal was overturned on appeal to the High Court , and a retrial ordered . However , before the retrial took place , Khoo was transferred from his position on the Bench to the Attorney-General 's Chambers to take up the post of deputy public prosecutor . This was considered to be a demotion . In 1986 , Jeyaratnam claimed in Parliament that the transfer had been made because Khoo had ruled in his favour in the 1984 case . However , a commission of inquiry formed to look into the circumstances surrounding the transfer found no evidence of this . For making the allegation , Jeyaratnam was referred to Parliament 's Committee of Privileges for abusing parliamentary privilege . While the Committee was considering the matter , Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the Committee 's proceedings and sent them to residents of his constituency . On 9 October 1986 , the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters ' contents to the Speaker of Parliament , which the Committee also considered . On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee 's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary , and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters . Fines totalling S $ 26,000 were imposed . Another concern which has been raised is that the routine shuffling of Subordinate Courts judges between the executive and judicial branches may result in them \" imbib [ ing ] the executive 's corporatist ideology , carrying that into adjudication , as a ' judiciary of amateurs ' \" . On the other hand , while a potential for executive interference exists due to the LSC 's control of Subordinate Court judicial appointments , it has been commented that in a small state like Singapore it may not be practical to have a separate judicial and legal service . Also , the appointment process may not be detrimental to the independence of the lower judiciary as the Chief Justice , who is not part of the executive or legislature , is the head of the LSC and has the final say on judicial postings . It has also been noted that , as much as institutional processes play a part in judicial independence , ultimately the willingness of judiciary to stand up to executive and legislative influence is the most important factor in ensuring an independent judiciary . Another incident said to have affected judicial independence in Singapore was the move by Parliament to amend the Constitution and the ISA to reverse the effect of the Court of Appeal 's decision Chng Suan Tze v. Minister of Home Affairs ( 1988 ) ( discussed in detail below ) . It has been asked if Parliament had \" taken away absolutely the judicial power of review for ISA preventive detention cases \" , and whether this reflected the Legislature 's \" distrust in the independence of the Judiciary and its ability to deal impartially with ISA cases that affect national security notwithstanding the limited form of judicial review laid down in Chng Suan Tze . \" Another commentator has framed it as \" an attack on the judiciary simply because it removes a vital aspect of judicial power \" and that this \" undermines judicial credibility \" . = = = = Natural justice = = = = It has been noted generally that natural justice is a fundamental element of the rule of law . In administrative law , the two principles of natural justice , which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights , are the rule against bias ( nemo iudex in causa sua , or \" no man a judge in his own cause \" ) and the right to be heard ( audi alteram partem , or \" hear the other side \" ) . In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd . & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd . ( 1978 ) , the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of \" fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties . \" Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999 , MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice , which he described thus : \" [ N ] atural justice requires essentially two basic principles . One is that you have the right to be heard and to explain your case , and , two , is the right to equal treatment . A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review . \" As was noted previously , the word law in provisions of the Constitution such as Articles 9 and 12 includes fundamental rules of natural justice . Jack Tsen-Ta Lee has suggested that these fundamental rules are both procedural and substantive in nature , and that substantive natural justice gives the courts discretion to strike down a law if its very object is unreasonable and oppressive . Under this view , to interpret Article 9 ( 1 ) as permitting Parliament to enact any provision that derogates from an individual 's personal liberty no matter how arbitrary or oppressive as long as procedural natural justice is observed , drains it of all content . Also , instead of the invalidation of legislation in this manner being seen as an encroachment by the judiciary into the legislature 's sphere , the application of substantive natural justice would simply be a full exercise of the judiciary 's proper constitutional role . Lee submits that Singapore courts should follow the Indian courts and apply a reasonableness test to determine if legislation is substantively constitutional . Ultimately , being able to review legislation by applying the substantive aspect of natural justice would \" entitle courts to examine whether it is appropriate for the legislature to deprive individual of certain aspects of their personal liberty , and the manner in which such deprivation is achieved . \" Conversely , Andrew Harding has argued that the idea of substantive natural justice is vague and subjective , and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature . In his opinion , Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation . To determine whether legislation is discriminatory , a rational nexus test is applied . It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice . Therefore , the extension of Article 12 ( 1 ) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense . Further support for this argument can be found in the Privy Council 's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor ( 1981 ) which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context , their Lordships stating that they had to consider \" whether the consequence of the alteration [ of certain statutory provisions ] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice \" . The substantive review of legislation by the court was also rejected in Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1995 ) , the Court of Appeal holding that \" any law which provides for the deprivation of a person 's life or personal liberty , is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament . The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair , just and reasonable as well . \" Subsequently , in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General ( 2011 ) , the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law \" are the same in nature and function , except that they operate at different levels of our legal order , one to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality , and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles \" . = = = = Judicial review = = = = Judicial review is the means by which legal rights are protected and good governance enforced . The ability of the courts to judicially review legislation and administrative action is considered an element of the rule of law . In R. v. Committee of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acting for the Visitor of the University of London , ex parte Vijayatunga ( 1987 ) , Judge Simon Brown said : \" Judicial review is the exercise of the court 's inherent power at common law to determine whether action is lawful or not ; in a word to uphold the rule of law \" . In Singapore , the vital role that the judiciary plays as a check on executive power was noted by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze , which held that all power given by law has legal limits and that \" the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power \" . This is further illustrated by Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis ( 2008 ) , in which it was stated that prosecutorial discretion is subject to judicial review and may be curtailed where exercised in bad faith or for extraneous purposes , or is in contravention of constitutional rights . In Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 2005 ) , the High Court held that if a litigant \" genuinely seek [ s ] the court 's assistance in vindicating or determining a legitimate grievance , the court has a duty to assess such a grievance and accord proper and serious consideration in determining whether relief should be granted \" . Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has also said it is the role of the courts in Singapore to give litigants their rights , whilst simultaneously playing a supporting role in the promotion of good governance through the articulation of clear rules and principles by which the executive can conform with the rule of law . He noted that 27.8 % of judicial review cases in Singapore since 1957 have been successful . However , certain matters are regarded as impervious to judicial review owing to limitations in the courts ' institutional capacity . Courts are generally reluctant to get involved in affairs relating to national security , leaving this role to the Government . At the same time , Singaporean courts are committed to careful scrutiny of matters to decide whether they are indeed non-justiciable , as affirmed in the Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co . Ltd . ( 2007 ) . This case held that courts would exclude matters involving \" high policy \" from their purview , but still analyse cases carefully to determine whether or not they truly fell within areas of executive immunity . Also , limitations on the role of the court have led to the rational conclusion that certain other areas are to be excluded from judicial review . These include matters in which the court lacks expertise and those which are polycentric , as was held in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General . = = = = Accessibility of justice = = = = Generally , justice is costly to provide and many legal systems , especially in Asia , are fraught with issues such as weak legal institutions , corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges , excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs and the lack of legal aid . It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law . The extent to which citizens have access to justice in any given society depends on whether a thick or thin conception of rule of law is adopted . Raz , speaking about a thin conception , proposed that the rule of the law requires courts to be accessible \u2013 that is , the legal system , at a bare minimum , should comprise formal institutions and mechanisms for administering appropriate legal processes and outcomes . A legal system complying with the thin rule of law also requires that laws are fairly , equally and effectively applied . On the other hand , when a thick conception of the rule of law is taken , a greater emphasis is placed on elements of substantive justice . It is suggested that a legal system operating as such may , in addition to the basic elements of access to justice in a thin rule of law , incorporate a moral or political philosophy , may incorporate ideas of \" democracy and legality \" , and give precedence to human rights in the administration of justice . Access to justice operating under a thick rule of law may be achieved by , among other things , increasing the efficiency of the judicial process , and having a robust legal profession , an incorruptible and independent judiciary , and a set of supporting institutions in order to increase the quality of justice administered . In Singapore , ensuring widespread and equal access to justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal . In this respect , the judiciary takes effort to ensure that both procedural and substantive elements of the rule of law are fulfilled \u2013 firstly , by continually increasing the efficiency of the courts and legal processes , and secondly , by regularly improving the skills , knowledge and values of and judges . In 1988 , the Singapore courts undertook the enormous task of clearing their extremely large backlogs in order to facilitate Singapore 's future development as an international business and finance centre . A multifaceted approach was adopted to dispose of cases expeditiously , including , among other things , the appointment of more judges and judicial commissioners , the use of information technology , electronic filing of documents and promoting the use of alternative dispute resolution . Such efforts significantly expedited the management of cases , both in the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts . In particular , specialized courts such as small claims tribunals , the Family Court and the Night Court were set up for better distribution of cases and have also helped to significantly reduce court fees . Over and above increasing the institutional capacity and efficiency of the courts , improving access to justice in Singapore has also meant a need for a corresponding increase in the quality of justice administered . Efforts to achieve this goal centre mainly on the appointment of the \" best and brightest officers \" and in particular , the constant upgrading of their skills and knowledge for judicial excellence . For this purpose , the Judicial Education Board was set up to provide guidance , training programmes and workshops for members of the judiciary , and is supported by a training unit within the Strategic Planning and Training Division of the Subordinate Courts . Such efforts aim to upgrade the competence of judges and equip them with the requisite knowledge for handling increasingly complex cases . Today , there are relatively few barriers to court access for litigants . The availability of legal aid and free mediation services aid litigants who may not be able to afford legal fees , and the use of video links and establishment of regional offices of small claims tribunals in various parts of Singapore assist parties who have difficulty coming to court . = = = Principles associated with the thick conception = = = = = = = Criticisms of the Internal Security Act = = = = As indicated above , a number of those who adopt a thick conception of the rule of law in Singapore criticize the existence of the Internal Security Act . The main point of contention is whether section 8 ( 1 ) of the Act should be interpreted in a subjective or objective way . This provision states that \" [ i ] f the President is satisfied with respect to any person that , with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any part thereof or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein , it is necessary to do so \" , the Minister for Home Affairs shall order that the person be , among other things , detained without trial for up to two years . In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1971 ) , the High Court affirmed that with respect to the President 's satisfaction that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore , mala fides or bad faith was \" not ... a justiciable issue in the context of the Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc \" . Essentially , this means that the President 's satisfaction is subjective , and not objective . The effect of this decision is that \" the Constitution left it to the executive , and not the judiciary , to decide what national security required \" . Subsequently , in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal took a different stand , holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA . ( Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended \" as the Minister sees fit \" , as well as to revoke such a direction . ) The Court said that \" the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law \" because \" all power has legal limits \" , and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court . Following this decision , the Parliament moved quickly to curb the judiciary 's change in stance . The Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 was enacted on 25 January 1989 and came into force on 30 January . In particular , section 8B ( 1 ) declared : [ T ] he law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the provisions of this Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971 ; and no part of the law before , on or after that date of any other country in the Commonwealth relating to judicial review shall apply . Section 8B ( 2 ) contained an ouster clause that restricted the scope of judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister . The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D , which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force . In addition , the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional . Article 149 ( 3 ) was inserted into the Constitution , with the effect that if the issue of whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court ( whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989 ) , the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments . Article 149 ( 1 ) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against , and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments . The validity of the 1989 ISA amendments was challenged unsuccessfully before the High Court and Court of Appeal in 1989 and 1990 respectively in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs . The High Court held that the 1989 amendments had merely reaffirmed the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng and thus could not be characterized as being contrary to the rule of law or having usurped judicial power : There is no abrogation of judicial power . It is erroneous to contend that the rule of law has been abolished by legislation and that Parliament has stated its absolute and conclusive judgment in applications for judicial review or other actions . Parliament has done no more than to enact the rule of law relating to the law applicable to judicial review . The legislation does not direct the court to enter a particular judgment or dismiss a particular case . The court is left to deal with the case on the basis of the amendments . Legislation designed against subversion must necessarily include provisions to ensure the effectiveness of preventive detention . The amendments are intended to do just that . On appeal , the Court of Appeal confirmed that it had to decide the case in accordance with the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the effect of section 8B ( 1 ) of the ISA was clear . Applying those legal principles , the Court held that the appellant had failed to prove that her detention had been made for reasons unrelated to national security . During the 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law , Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as \" there is no way of checking the Minister 's decision , who decides to make an order detaining a subject , depriving him of his liberty , completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free \" . He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed , saying : \" The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more . Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law . Let us be honest and repeal it . \" Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that \" the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception . It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister . It is in that sense a subjective discretion . \" Nonetheless , he recognized that the ISA remained relevant , for instance , as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage , and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong : \" It is a case-by-case decision , because that is how we live our lives in a real society . \" Responding to Jeyaretnam , Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions , and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act , including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public , and also the President 's personal discretion to order a detainee 's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention . Speaking at the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore , Shanmugam explained that stability was one of the essential conditions for Singapore 's governance , and that the ISA contributed to the stability of the country by enabling terrorist threats to be dealt with . In response , Michael Galligan , the Chairman of the International Section , wrote that \" whatever might be appropriate for times of extraordinary danger should not be assumed to be the measure for ordinary times . Circumscription of liberties that may have some arguable justification in a national defense crisis should not set the norm for more peaceful or more ' ordinary ' times in the life of a nation . \" In a 16 September 2011 statement , the Ministry of Home Affairs said that the Government had used the ISA \" sparingly \" , and not for detaining people solely for their political beliefs . It expressed the view that \" [ t ] he ISA continues to be relevant and crucial as a measure of last resort for the preservation of our national security \" . = = = Cases = = = Ong Ah Chuan v.

                "Taylor v. Illinois = Taylor v. Illinois , 484 U.S. 400 , is a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances , even if that hurts the defense 's case . Taylor was the first case to hold that there is no absolute bar to blocking the testimony of a surprise witness , even if that is an essential witness for the defendant , a limitation of the broad right to present a defense recognized in Washington v. Texas . Taylor was the first Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a specific limitation on the right of defendants to force their witnesses to testify . In that case , the Court construed a defendant 's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense . Here , however , the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules , especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense . This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices , all of whom felt a defendant 's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant 's attorney to list appropriate witnesses . = = Background = = = = = History of discovery rules = = = Discovery procedures for defendants began with adoption of state laws in the 1920s . In the following decades , courts began instituting new procedures . In 1962 , for example , the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules , without an initial law requiring it . However , a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system . Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony , but no ' alibi notice rule ' was fashioned , leading to an unworkable position for both sides . In 1974 , the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system , ending the state 's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making . In 1970 , the United States Supreme Court first set down principles in terms of the constitutionality of discovery rules . In Williams v. Florida , the Court held that Florida 's ' notice-of-alibi ' rule did not violate the Fifth Amendment . While the rule in Williams was reciprocal , it was not for another three years before the Court mandated that discovery rules had to be reciprocal as a general principle . The decision articulated the \" two-way street \" approach , that \" trials be run as a ' search for truth ' \" without either side maintaining \" ' poker game ' secrecy for its own witnesses \" . Along with these decisions that were specific to the discovery process , the Supreme Court broadened the general constitutional rights for defendants in the 1967 ruling of Washington v. Texas . In Washington , the Court incorporated the Compulsory Process Clause against the states , holding that \" the Constitution is violated by arbitrary rules that prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying \" . Despite this , the Court did not rule specifically on whether the preclusion sanction was appropriate , instead applying the constitutional standard for an absolutist state law . Over the next few decades , the Supreme Court rejected attempts to review the sole constitutionality of a preclusion sanction . = = = Taylor 's trial = = = On August 6 , 1981 , Ray Taylor was arrested for the murder of Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago . In advance of the trial , the prosecutor submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case . The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals , which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter . When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses on the second day of the trial , the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution . Therefore , it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify . The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness , Wormley , was known to the defense prior to trial , but was hidden away from the prosecution . A jury convicted Taylor of the murder charge and the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed . It held that when \" discovery rules are violated , the trial judge may exclude the evidence which the violating party wishes to introduce \" . The Appellate Court 's ruling further gave the trial judge discretion in the appropriate remedy in such a case \u2013 whether to exclude entirely the ' surprise ' witnesses . Taylor sought a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court to review his case , which was accepted . = = Opinion of the Court = = Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion , which affirmed the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court , and upheld Taylor 's conviction . He began by addressing the position of the state of Illinois , who argued that there is never a Compulsory Process Clause concern when preclusion of a witness is used as a discovery sanction . The Court had held the converse view , Stevens wrote that \" few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense \" . This strong footing of Sixth Amendment values forced the Court to reject the State 's absolutist argument . At the same time though , the Court rejected the defendant 's broad claim that there could never be preclusion of a defense witness . Stevens wrote that \" [ t ] he Compulsory Process Clause provides [ the defendant ] with an effective weapon , but it is a weapon that cannot be used irresponsibly \" . The whole adversarial process would be destroyed , Stevens argued , if either side could simply refuse to follow the basic rules of the Court . There are \" countervailing public interests \" which weigh against the absolute defense position . The broader idea embedded in the opinion was the idea that willful misconduct of an attorney lowers the truthfulness of proffered testimony . In the instant case , the Court held that a trial judge could hold the \" presumption \" that a new witnesses ' testimony is perjured due to \" a pattern of discovery violations \" . The pattern in Taylor 's case was a series of two amendments to the witness list done in bad faith . \" It would demean the high purpose of the [ Clause ] to construe it as encompassing an absolute right to an automatic continuance or mistrial \" , Stevens wrote . As the misconduct of the judge towards the defense counsel did not implicate the Sixth Amendment 's Compulsory Process Clause , there was no need to disrupt the lower courts ' decisions . Further , even though the defendant was harmed by the defense counsel error , Stevens wrote that such an argument could not excuse the counsel 's fault . Despite the rejection of Taylor 's constitutional position , the Court did create the framework for a balancing test for lower courts to use in handling future discovery preclusion questions . A trial court must balance the defendant 's interest in a robust defense with the ( i ) state 's interest in ' efficient ' justice , ( ii ) state 's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity , ( iii ) state 's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules , and ( iv ) the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant 's discovery violation . = = = Brennan 's dissent = = = Justice Brennan 's dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun . Brennan argued that the \" Court 's balancing test creates a conflict of interest in every case involving a discovery violation \" such that a better approach would be to hold that the \" Compulsory Process Clause per se bars discovery sanctions that exclude criminal defense evidence \" . Brennan quoted at length from Washington v.

The route runs from Vienna in Dorchester County northwest to Easton in Talbot County , intersecting U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) at both ends . MD 331 is a two-lane undivided road most of its length that passes mostly through agricultural areas . The road also passes through the communities of Hurlock and Preston along the way . It encounters several routes during its journey , including MD 14 near Rhodesdale and MD 16 in the Preston area , both of which the route forms concurrencies with . In addition , the route also intersects with MD 392 and MD 307 in Hurlock and with MD 318 near Preston . Most of present-day MD 331 was designated as part of US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established . By 1940 , US 213 was moved to a new alignment that crossed the Choptank River at Cambridge on a bridge built in 1935 and MD 331 was designated to run from Vienna to Easton . Both ends of MD 331 have been shortened since , with the southernmost portion of MD 331 curtailed following the completion of the US 50 bypass of Vienna by the 1990s and the northern terminus of the route cut back to US 50 in 2004 when the state-maintained portion of Dover Road to Dover Street in Easton was turned over to the city . = = Route description = = MD 331 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial within the town of Easton . = = = Dorchester County = = = MD 331 begins at an interchange with US 50 in Vienna , Dorchester County , a short distance west of the Nanticoke River . From this interchange , the route heads north on Rhodesdale Vienna Road , a two-lane undivided road . It passes through wooded areas , with a set of power lines and an abandoned railroad line located along the east side of the road . MD 331 continues into farmland , with some rural residences alongside the road , before it approaches Reids Grove , where MD 819 ( Reids Grove Road ) loops to the west of MD 331 . Past Reids Grove , the route continues through a mix of woodland and farmland , still paralleling the power lines and the abandoned railroad . MD 331 reaches Rhodesdale , where it intersects MD 14 ( Rhodesdale Eldorado Road ) . At this intersection , the route makes a left turn to run concurrent with MD 14 along East New Market Rhodesdale Road , heading west through Rhodesdale . The road leaves Rhodesdale and heads into farmland . MD 331 splits from MD 14 by turning north on Shiloh Church Hurlock Road at an intersection . Along Shiloh Church Hurlock Road , MD 331 passes a few residences before heading through more farm fields . MD 331 enters Hurlock and heads into residential areas , with the name changing to Main Street at the Jackson Street intersection . It passes more residences before intersecting MD 392 ( Delaware Avenue ) . Past MD 392 , the road passes more homes before it heads into the downtown area of Hurlock , where it crosses the Maryland and Delaware Railroad 's Seaford Line and MD 307 ( Broad Street ) . Past this intersection , MD 331 heads northwest on Academy Street past numerous homes before the road leaves Hurlock . Upon leaving Hurlock , the road becomes Waddells Corner Road and it heads into farmland . The road turns to the west and continues through agricultural areas with intermittent residences . It comes to an intersection with MD 16 ( East New Market Ellwood Road ) , where MD 331 makes a right turn to head north along with MD 16 . MD 16 and MD 331 head north through a mix of woods and farms with some residences . The road continues through rural areas with an increasing number of residences as it approaches the Preston area .

The route intersects MD 324 ( Maple Avenue ) before reaching the center of town , where MD 16 splits from MD 331 by heading northeast on Harmony Road . Past this intersection , the route passes more residences before leaving Preston , where it becomes Dover Bridge Road . It heads north into rural areas of woods and farms with some residences along the road . The road turns to the northwest and intersects Tanyard Road . MD 331 turns west and continues to the residential community of Bethlehem , where it intersects MD 578 ( Bethlehem Road ) . Past Bethlehem , the road continues past many rural residences . MD 331 enters wetlands as it approaches the Choptank River , which it crosses into Talbot County on the Dover Bridge , a swing bridge . Upon entering Talbot County , the route becomes Dover Road and continues to the northwest through a mix of woodland and farmland . It turns to the west with the number of residences increasing as it approaches Easton . Upon reaching Easton , MD 331 heads into commercial and industrial areas . The route ends at the intersection with US 50 ( Ocean Gateway ) , where Dover Road continues west as a local road toward downtown Easton . = = History = = MD 331 from Rhodesdale to Easton was one of the original state roads marked for improvement in 1909 . In 1910 , the only paved sections of the highway were the approaches to Dover Bridge in both Talbot County and Caroline County . The state road was paved from Hurlock to Shiloh Church in 1912 , from Easton to Waddell 's Corner in 1913 and 1914 , from Waddell 's Corner to Hurlock in 1915 , and within Hurlock in 1916 . When the U.S. Highway System was organized in 1926 , the state road became part of US 213 . The first section of the Vienna \u2013 Rhodesdale highway was 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) of pavement south from Rhodesdale that was completed by 1923 . The remainder of the highway was under construction by 1924 , with another 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) section of the road completed north from Vienna by 1927 . The gap between Vienna and Rhodesdale was filled in 1928 . When the Nanticoke River Bridge at Vienna was completed in 1931 , US 213 was rerouted between Mardela Springs and Rhodesdale to pass through Vienna . A new Dover Bridge , replacing a bridge built in the 19th century , was completed in 1932 . In 1939 , the original MD 331 and US 213 swapped routes ; US 213 also assumed MD 344 between Vienna and MD 16 at Mount Holly . MD 331 has seen little change since 1939 . MD 331 and MD 16 were realigned around Ellwood and Linchester around 1960 . MD 331 's southern terminus was truncated at its newly constructed interchange with US 50 in Vienna in 1991 shortly after US 50 bypassed Vienna . MD 331 's northern terminus has been rolled back twice in Easton . The state highway was rolled back from Washington Street to Park Street in 1983 .

The portion of DE 2 along Elkton Road between the Maryland border and Newark was widened into a divided highway in 1972 . In 2013 , DelDOT proposed the renumbering of routes in and around Newark , which involved truncating DE 2 from the Maryland border to the eastern edge of Newark and the removal of DE 2 Bus. through downtown Newark . As a result of these changes , the portion of Elkton Road between the Maryland border and the Christiana Parkway was to be designated as DE 279 .

US-59 serves several lakes and towns through Oklahoma 's Green Country , including Grand Lake , a major recreation center . The route enters the state from Arkansas near Fogel , Arkansas , and ends at the Kansas state line south of Chetopa , Kansas . US-59 was first designated in Oklahoma around 1935 . The highway 's route at that time was largely the same as it is today ; however , between the Afton area and Welch , US-59 passed through Vinita instead following the modern-day route passing east of it . US-59 was changed to follow the present-day route in 1951 .

In Jay , SH-20 joins the concurrency as US-59 and SH-10 turn east toward downtown Jay . There , the three highways form the southern terminus of SH-127 . On the east side of Jay , US-59 and SH-10 turn north , leaving SH-20 as it heads east towards its intersection with Arkansas Highway 43 . North of Jay , US-59 and SH-10 intersect with SH-127 again , this time at its northern terminus . US-59 and SH-10 cross over the Honey Creek arm of Grand Lake o ' the Cherokees before coming to Grove , where SH-10 turns east and US-59 turns west . As it leaves Grove , US-59 turns northwest , running the length of a peninsula out into the lake . At the end of the peninsula , US-59 crosses the lake yet again , landing on the north shore near Copeland . The highway then passes into Ottawa County . The next highway junction for US-59 , the first in Ottawa County , is with SH-125 . US-59 turns due west shortly after this junction , then curves to due north . Just east of Afton , US-59 joins US-60 and US-69 , and the three highways head northeast . However , only 0.8 miles ( 1.3 km ) northeast of the junction , US-60 splits off at a cloverleaf interchange which also provides access to I-44 , the Will Rogers Turnpike . US-59 and US-69 continue northward to Narcissa , where they are the site of SH-25 's eastern terminus . Further north , at Dotyville , US-59 meets SH-10 again , turning west along it , while US-69 heads east along SH-10 toward Miami . US-59 and SH-10 continue west , turning north for one mile ( 1.6 km ) before turning back to the west . Southwest of Dawes , the highways cross into Craig County . The northernmost town that US-59 serves in Oklahoma is Welch . Here , US-59 splits away from SH-10 , turning northward along unsigned SH-2 , its final stretch in Oklahoma . The highway crosses the Kansas state line 14.53 miles ( 23.38 km ) north of Welch . = = History = = Before US-59 was designated in Oklahoma , what would become its route was designated as US-270 between the Arkansas state line and Poteau , US-271 between Poteau and Sunset Corner , SH-10 along the modern-day SH-9 concurrency , SH-17 between Sallisaw and West Siloam Springs , SH-33 between West Siloam Springs and the town of Kansas , and SH-10 between Kansas and Grove . There was no road between modern-day SH-9 and Sallisaw . US-59 first appeared on the official state map in 1935 . At this time , the road south of Sallisaw was marked as \" Conditional Location \" , and between Grove and the Kansas state line , the highway followed a different route : it proceeded west out of Grove to meet US-60 / US-66 south of Afton , concurring with those two highways to Vinita , where it turned north along SH-2 , following it to Welch and the state line . The gap between SH-10 and Sallisaw was filled by the designation of a state highway there by the Oklahoma State Highway Commission on November 15 , 1935 . The commission designated this highway as US-59 , effective upon the completion of its construction . Maintenance of the portion of this road in Sequoyah County was authorized on October 22 , 1936 . On October 3 , 1951 , the highway commission approved the realignment of US-59 between the highway junction northeast of Afton and Welch . The old highway between Vinita and Welch became the northern SH-2 . The Highway Commission modified US-59 's route through Westville on February 5 , 1952 . Previously , at the site of the present-day US-59 / US-62 intersection , US-59 turned east along US-62 , splitting off at Williams Avenue , then followed Williams Avenue north to Main Street , where it turned east . At the eastern city limit of Westville , US-59 turned north , joining its modern-day alignment 3.2 miles ( 5.1 km ) north of the US-62 junction . With the 1952 realignment , US-59 continued straight through the intersection , bypassing Westville to the west . The next change to US-59 was a realignment between the SH-33 junction in the town of Kansas and downtown Jay . The new highway had several curves straightened , reducing this segment 's length from 20.6 miles ( 33.2 km ) to 18.9 miles ( 30.4 km ) . This change was approved by the Highway Commission on August 19 , 1952 . On July 6 , 1964 , the Oklahoma State Highway Commission approved a realignment to US-59 's route through Poteau . Another change , further north , was approved on March 4 , 1968 . This moved US-59 onto a new bridge over the Arkansas River upon completion of its construction , with the old highway being turned over to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . An application for this change was received by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) on March 26 , 1968 , and approved by that body on June 18 , 1968 . The highway commission approved another alteration to US-59 in the Poteau area on February 5 , 1973 . On that date , the commission approved a realignment of US-59 from a point south of the intersection with US-270 and US-271 , to that junction , and on into Poteau . The realignment was submitted to AASHO on April 10 of that year , received on April 13 , and approved on June 26 . A section of highway north of Jay was straightened on October 7 , 1974 . Another straightening was approved the following year , this time in the vicinity of Heavener ; this change was approved by the highway commission on August 19 , 1975 , and approved by AASHO , now renamed to AASHTO , on July 13 , 1976 . On March 7 , 1977 , the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission ( which had replaced the highway commission ) approved another straightening in the Howe area . The realignment was approved by AASHTO on July 7 , 1977 . The next change to US-59 came on November 2 , 1981 , when the transportation commission approved moving just over 5 1 \u2044 2 miles ( 8.9 km ) of highway between Flint and West Siloam Springs to the north of the previous alignment . AASHTO approved the realignment on June 29 , 1982 . A section of highway , south of Stilwell , in Sequoyah and Adair counties , was straightened , shortening the highway by 0.22 miles ( 350 m ) . The transportation commission approved on October 4 , 1982 . On September 7 , 1999 , the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission approved an item realigning US-59 and SH-100 in Stilwell , removing US-59 from Second Street and placing it on Front Street . On March 3 , 2003 , the commission approved elimination of two sharp curves in western Ottawa County , shortening the highway by 0.57 miles ( 0.92 km ) . The section of US-59 between I-40 and SH-9 was pressed into service as a detour for eastbound I-40 traffic after the collapse of its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26 , 2002 . = = Junction list = =",

                    "text": "Interstate 97 = Interstate 97 ( I-97 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs entirely within Maryland . The intrastate Interstate runs 17.62 miles ( 28.36 km ) from U.S. Route 50 and US 301 in Parole near Annapolis north to I-695 and I-895 in Brooklyn Park near Baltimore . The Interstate is the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis . I-97 connects Annapolis with Baltimore \u2013 Washington International Airport and links the northern Anne Arundel County communities of Crownsville , Millersville , Severna Park , Glen Burnie , and Ferndale . It is the shortest primary Interstate Highway . I-97 was constructed along the corridor of Maryland Route 3 ( MD 3 ) between Millersville and Ferndale and MD 178 between Parole and Millersville . From Millersville to south of Glen Burnie , the Interstate closely follows the former course of MD 3 , which was built in the late 1910s and early 1920s and expanded to a divided highway in the late 1950s . North of there , the highway follows the Glen Burnie Bypass , a freeway built in the mid-1950s . The segment of I-97 from Millersville to Crownsville originated as a two-lane portion of MD 32 in the early 1970s . The Interstate was introduced in 1979 after the state of Maryland successfully obtained Interstate mileage for a Baltimore \u2013 Annapolis freeway from the federal government . The state decided to build the highway along I-97 's current corridor rather than along the MD 2 corridor , which has partial freeway access via MD 10 . Construction on I-97 began in the late 1980s with new construction from US 50 and US 301 to Crownsville . The Crownsville \u2013 Millersville segment of MD 32 was expanded and incorporated into the Interstate and the MD 3 \u2013 MD 32 junction was upgraded . The portion of the MD 3 corridor from Millersville to south of Glen Burnie was upgraded on the spot to Interstate Highway standards in the early 1990s , after which MD 3 was truncated at Millersville . I-97 's interchange with I-695 was rebuilt in the late 1980s and early 1990s . The Glen Burnie Bypass was upgraded and expanded to six lanes in the mid-1990s . The complex process included reconstruction of several interchanges ; the last interchange to be reconstructed was upgraded in the mid-2000s . = = Route description = = I-97 begins at US 50 and US 301 ( John Hanson Highway ) , which run concurrently with unsigned I-595 , on the edge of the community of Parole west of Annapolis . The freeways meet at a semi-directional T interchange ; the ramp from I-97 to eastbound US 50 and US 301 merges with a collector-distributor road that extends east to that freeway 's interchange with MD 665 ( Aris T. Allen Boulevard ) . I-97 heads northwest as a four-lane freeway with a speed limit of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . The freeway crosses over MD 450 ( Defense Highway ) and passes along the south and west sides of Crownsville , where it crosses several tributaries of the Bacon Ridge Branch of the South River . North of Crownsville , I-97 has a partial interchange that comprises a pair of long ramps to MD 178 ( Generals Highway ) ; the interchange allows access from southbound I-97 to MD 178 and from the state highway to the northbound Interstate . I-97 gains an extra lane in each direction from the MD 178 ramps ; those extra lanes split off at the freeway 's partial interchange with the eastern end of MD 32 just north of Millersville . The Interstate curves northeast and has a complementary partial interchange with the northern end of MD 3 ( Robert Crain Highway ) . The two state highways meet each other at a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange immediately to the west of I-97 's sweeping curve , which facilitates all movements between the three highways . I-97 continues north as a six-lane freeway and is closely paralleled on the east by Veterans Highway on the western edge of Severna Park . The highways cross Severn Run within Severn Run Natural Environment Area before they diverge slightly at the Interstate 's partial cloverleaf interchange with Benfield Boulevard ; access from northbound I-97 to the crossroad is via Veterans Highway . I-97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each other to the latter highway 's northern end at I-97 's partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business ( Robert Crain Highway ) and New Cut Road . The interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to northbound Veterans Highway just south of its intersection with MD 3 Business . The freeway continues north along the west side of Glen Burnie and meets MD 174 ( Quarterfield Road ) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and MD 100 at a cloverstack interchange that has flyover exit ramps from both directions of I-97 . I-97 temporarily gains two extra lanes in each direction between MD 100 and its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 176 ( Dorsey Road ) . Access from the southbound Interstate to MD 176 is via MD 162 ( Aviation Boulevard ) , which forms part of the Airport Loop surrounding Baltimore \u2013 Washington International Airport . I-97 continues through Ferndale , where it crosses over the Glen Burnie branch of the Baltimore Light Rail immediately before the highway 's four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 ( Baltimore \u2013 Annapolis Boulevard ) , which provides access to the transit line 's terminal station , Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie . I-97 's final interchange is with I-695 ( Baltimore Beltway ) . The Interstate crosses the Cabin Branch of Curtis Creek within the interchange , which includes a flyover ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 ; that ramp and the one from eastbound I-695 to I-97 merge on the inside of the two carriageways of the Beltway . The Interstate drops to four lanes and reaches its northern terminus just north of the loop ramp from westbound I-695 to I-97 in Brooklyn Park . The highway continues as I-895A , a pair of ramps that merge with the spur from I-895 ( Harbor Tunnel Thruway ) to MD 2 ( Governor Ritchie Highway ) . The continuation from I-97 includes a ramp to westbound I-695 that allows access to the Beltway 's interchange with MD 648 . I-97 does not have an official name . However , the Interstate is dedicated to John A. Cade , who served the area around Severna Park in the Maryland Senate from 1974 to his 1996 death and who worked to secure funding for the highway . The Maryland General Assembly passed a dedication bill in 1998 , and the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) installed a pair of signs noting the dedication in Millersville and near Parole . Like all Interstate Highways , I-97 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length . I-97 is the shortest 2-digit mainline Interstate and only intracounty 2-digit Interstate in the contiguous United States . = = History = = = = = Predecessor highways = = = The first modern highway along the path of what is now I-97 followed the corridor from New Cut Road to south of the intersection of MD 178 and Veterans Highway at Dorrs Corner . This highway was intended as a second route from Glen Burnie to Annapolis to complement the highway along the east side of the Severn River ; this western route later became known as General 's Highway , a name still applied to its MD 178 portion . Construction of this highway was underway by 1919 . The new highway was completed as a gravel road from New Cut Road to north of Benfield and as a concrete road through Benfield and across Severn Run to near Dorrs Corner by 1921 . In 1922 , this highway was designated part of Robert Crain Highway , a new highway to connect the Baltimore area with Southern Maryland . The Glen Burnie \u2013 Dorrs Corner portion of the new highway was reconstructed and completed as a concrete road from Glen Burnie south through Millersville by 1923 . Robert Crain Highway became part of MD 3 in 1927 and then US 301 in 1939 when the U.S. Highway was extended from Virginia to Baltimore . MD 3 was reconstructed in 1933 and 1934 . The reconstruction eliminated several dangerous curves , particularly near Severn Run , and expanded the highway from a width of 15 to 20 feet ( 4.6 to 6.1 m ) . Veterans Highway follows much of that early 1930s course . The next portion of I-97 predecessor highway was built as the four-lane Glen Burnie Bypass from Robert Crain Highway and New Cut Road north to the Baltimore Beltway . Construction on the four-lane freeway began in August 1954 with construction of several bridges over or for the highway ; these bridges were completed in 1955 and 1956 . The dual roadways and interchange ramps from the southern end of the bypass to MD 648 were constructed starting in March 1955 ; the concrete-surfaced highway was completed in February 1957 . The northernmost portion of the bypass , including the adjacent portion of the Baltimore Beltway , was constructed between December 1955 and September 1957 . US 301 was moved onto the bypass and the adjacent portion of the Beltway when the projects were completed in 1957 . The small portion of I-97 north of the Beltway was added to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel project as a direct connection between the Glen Burnie Bypass and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway 's southern approach from MD 2 in 1955 . This segment was completed and opened with the tunnel and its approach highways in November 1957 . The Glen Burnie Bypass was constructed with five interchanges : a partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 3 Business and New Cut Road ; a tighter four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 174 ; a diamond interchange at MD 176 ; the current four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 648 ; and a half-cloverleaf interchange at I-695 allowing full access between the Glen Burnie Bypass and Beltway but no access between the Beltway and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway . US 301 was expanded to a divided highway from the southern end of the Glen Burnie Bypass to Benfield in 1956 and 1957 . The highway 's second set of lanes , including a new bridge across Severn Run , was constructed and the existing roadway was reconstructed from Benfield to Millersville between 1957 and 1960 . The second set of lanes was built on the west side of what became a very wide median , which allowed businesses to site themselves in the median between the northbound and southbound lanes . During construction of the Benfield \u2013 Millersville stretch , US 301 was relocated to its present course from Bowie to the Eastern Shore and replaced with MD 3 . A pair of ramps between the Glen Burnie Bypass and MD 177 's freeway southern bypass of Glen Burnie ( now MD 100 ) were constructed between 1963 and 1965 . The first section of highway south of Dorrs Corner was built between 1969 and 1972 as a two-lane segment of MD 32 from east of Odenton to MD 178 in Crownsville . The highway used what are now the ramps of I-97 's partial interchange with MD 178 and had a five-ramp interchange with MD 3 in Millersville that lacked access from northbound MD 3 to eastbound MD 32 and from westbound MD 32 to southbound MD 3 . = = = Interstate designation and construction = = = Despite the existence or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis , a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed as early as 1956 in the form of the Arundel Expressway , which would relieve congestion on MD 2 . The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978 . MD 10 was proposed to continued south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50 , but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975 . MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991 . The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore \u2013 Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 . However , the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore \u2013 Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard \u2013 Cramer amendment , which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred . Much of the mileage of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the Washington area . With Interstate funding assured , MDSHA commissioned the Baltimore \u2013 Annapolis Transportation Corridor Study in 1973 to figure out , among other things , the best route for the Baltimore \u2013 Annapolis Interstate . The study discovered a western route following the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors would be less disruptive and require fewer acquisitions of homes and businesses compared to an extension of the Arundel Expressway south along the MD 2 corridor . In June 1979 , MDSHA announced plans for I-97 . The original route numbering plan , which was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) at its November 1975 meeting , was for I-97 to include its current route plus US 50 from Parole west to I-95 ( Capital Beltway ) . That proposal included two auxiliary Interstate highways . I-197 would follow US 50 and US 301 east from I-97 to just west of the Severn River . I-297 would follow MD 3 between a pair of intersections with I-97 in Millersville and Bowie . AASHTO rescinded its approval of the 1975 plan at its June 1981 meeting , then approved what was essentially the original 1975 plan at its June 1982 meeting . The east \u2013 west segment of I-97 and I-197 was replaced by I-68 . I-297 was withdrawn by request of the state of Maryland in 1983 . The 1982 concept of I-68 became unsigned I-595 and I-68 was applied to the National Freeway in Western Maryland in 1991 after AASHTO approved the new designations at its June 1989 meeting . The first portion of I-97 proper to be constructed was the section south of Millersville , which was placed under construction in three sections in March 1985 . The first section of the highway , from US 50 and US 301 to Millersville Road west of the MD 178 interchange , opened in December 1987 . Construction of I-97 from Millersville Road to the intersection of MD 3 and MD 178 at Dorrs Corner started in July 1987 . The Interstate through Millersville opened in April 1989 . The interchange at I-97 's southern terminus was originally constructed as a partial interchange , with I-97 tying into what are now the collector-distributor lanes of US 50 and US 301 . The ramps from eastbound US 50 and US 301 to I-97 and from I-97 to the westbound U.S. Highways were added during the reconstruction of US 50 and US 301 in 1992 and 1993 . = = = Reconstruction of existing highway = = = Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex operation that involved many temporary openings , lane shifts , construction of new roadways , and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years . The first improvement was the reconstruction of the I-695 interchange between 1987 and 1991 . The modern ramps from I-97 to westbound I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built , eastbound I-695 's ramp over these two ramps was constructed , and the loop ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 was removed . I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway ramps was reconstructed to Interstate Highway standards and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995 . Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to westbound I-695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648 . Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway from Millersville to MD 3 Business began in 1987 over two sections . The first section , from north of MD 3 Business to north of Benfield Boulevard , began in 1987 . The work included the construction of the flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to Veterans Highway just south of MD 3 Business . The section from north of Benfield Boulevard to MD 178 at Dorrs Corner was reconstructed starting in 1989 . The second section included construction of the Benfield Boulevard interchange . The southbound MD 3 roadway was rebuilt in place as the southbound lanes of I-97 . New northbound lanes were built immediately to the east of the southbound lanes . In February 1991 , the new northbound lanes opened and access from I-97 to Veterans Highway was removed at Dorrs Corner . The old northbound lanes were reconstructed and re-purposed as a two-lane road , Veterans Highway , later that year . Anne Arundel County agreed to accept Veterans Highway for maintenance after the I-97 \u2013 related construction concluded in a road transfer agreement on July 21 , 1988 . MD 3 was truncated at Millersville after I-97 opened in October 1991 ; signage for MD 3 on I-695 was removed by 1993 . Before reconstruction of the Glen Burnie Bypass from MD 3 Business to MD 648 began in November 1993 , the Stewart Avenue bridge across the Interstate just south of the MD 100 interchange was replaced and ramps from northbound I-97 to eastbound MD 100 and from westbound MD 100 to southbound I-97 were added between 1990 and 1992 . The freeway was reconstructed to Interstate standards in three sections . The middle section from MD 174 to MD 176 was reconstructed concurrently with the segment of MD 100 west from I-97 to MD 295 starting in 1993 . That segment of MD 100 , including the MD 100 \u2013 I-97 interchange , opened in November 1996 , and the reconstruction of the middle section of I-96 was finished in July 1997 . The sections of I-97 from MD 3 Business to MD 174 and from MD 176 to MD 648 and were reconstructed starting in January 1994 . The MD 176 \u2013 MD 648 roadway section was completed in March 1996 . The northern half of the MD 176 interchange was reconstructed as part of the latter project . The new loop ramp from northbound I-97 to westbound MD 176 and the new ramp from MD 176 to northbound I-97 were completed in 1995 . The ramp from southbound I-97 to MD 176 was removed during the widening project . The pair of ramps between southbound I-97 and MD 162 to replace the removed ramp were constructed between 1996 and 1998 . The final piece of construction on I-97 was the reconstruction of its interchange with MD 174 , which began in 2002 and concluded in 2005 . = = Exit list = = The entire route is in Anne Arundel County .",

                    "text": "Alvin Kersh = Alvin D. Kersh is a fictional character in the Fox science fiction television series The X-Files . He serves as a figure of authority within the series , first introduced as an Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and is later promoted to the post of Deputy Director . Kersh acts as an antagonist who bureaucratically prevents Special Agents Fox Mulder , Dana Scully , John Doggett and Monica Reyes from investigating cases dealing with the paranormal , dubbed X-Files . Kersh is played by James Pickens , Jr .. Kersh first appeared as a guest role in several episodes of the series ' sixth season , returning as a recurring character in the eighth and ninth seasons . Kersh 's creation was driven by a need to place pressure on the character of Walter Skinner . The character has been met with mixed to negative critical responses , although he was initially positively received before coming to be considered a \" one-note \" role as the series progressed . Pickens , as part of the series ' ensemble cast , earned a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for his work . = = Character arc = = Kersh 's first appearance in the series was during the sixth season opening episode \" The Beginning \" . As an Assistant Director , he temporarily became supervisor to Agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) when they were assigned away from the X-Files division . During this time The Smoking Man could be seen in his office , reminiscent of his silent presence in Walter Skinner 's office in early seasons . Kersh assigned Mulder and Scully mostly to menial tasks , such as terrorist details and Federal background checks . When they did investigate an X-File behind his back , Kersh would charge them for expenses they incurred on the case , forcing them to pay out of their own pocket . He also attempted to separate Mulder and Scully , believing that Mulder threw away a promising career as a criminal profiler , but that Scully 's career could still be saved . When Mulder and Scully were reassigned to the X-Files office , Kersh continued to climb the ladder , culminating in an assignment as Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . It was not long after his promotion that Mulder was abducted by aliens . At the beginning of the eighth season , Kersh assigned John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) to run the manhunt for Mulder . When the manhunt failed , Doggett was assigned to the X-files with Scully , until Mulder was found in \" This Is Not Happening \" . When Mulder returned , Kersh refused to assign him to the X-Files , keeping Doggett in that position . When Mulder and Doggett pursued an unauthorized case , Kersh was prepared to fire them both , but Mulder accepted full responsibility and was dismissed from the FBI . Shortly thereafter , Mulder disappeared again . After Doggett saw Kersh in a late night meeting with two conspirators , Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane , Doggett brought in Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) to help him investigate Kersh 's involvement in Mulder 's disappearance . The investigation turned up nothing . Although Doggett seemed convinced that Kersh was involved in the conspiracy , Kersh insisted that he was actually protecting Mulder . During the ninth season , the Toothpick Man ( Alan Dale ) , a key conspirator , could be seen in the company of Kersh , much like The Smoking Man before . In the end , Kersh showed a heroic side during the series finale \" The Truth \" , when he helped Doggett and Skinner free Mulder from a military prison . Following this , Kersh had to permanently close the X-Files to appease his irate superiors . = = Conceptual history = = The character was named after Dr. Kersh and Anton Kersh , characters from Vampire Circus \u2014 a favourite film of series creator Chris Carter . According to writer and producer Frank Spotnitz , the creation of the Kersh character was due to the writers desiring to create another of the several characters in the series who put pressure on Walter Skinner . When reflecting on the casting of James Pickens , Jr . , Spotnitz called him \" another great find \" , adding that \" so many times over the course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful . That 's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek , and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner , and that 's what happened here with James Pickens . Just a fantastic actor , not at all like this person , really transformed himself to play this part \" . Spotnitz thought that , for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X-Files ' sixth season , there was a great sense of gratification when \u2014 in the final moments of \" One Son \" \u2014 Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right , all along , precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way . Pickens prepared for this role by observing several of Kersh 's real-life counterparts at the FBI 's Los Angeles office , where , according to the actor , the most useful thing he learned was that most of the people at Kersh 's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason . Robert Patrick , who portrayed John Doggett , recognized that his own character and Kersh were \" both military men \u2013 Air Force , Marines \" . Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War . Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that , as Kersh , Pickens would \" come in each week and just nail his stuff \" regardless of what else was going on . Similarly , Frank Spotnitz thought that \" Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry , loved playing scenes together . And I think their scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show . \" = = Reception = = Michael Avalos , writing for the Knight Ridder Tribune , felt positively about the introduction of Kersh , saying he harbored \" almost fond memories \" of the former recurring character , Section Chief Scott Blevins , played by Charles Cioffi . George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the Contra Costa Times reacted positive towards James Pickens , Jr . ' s performance in the eighth season 's \" Via Negativa \" , saying the story \" clicked \" thanks to Kersh and Walter Skinner . Salon writer Aaron Kinner when writing a review for the ninth season , noted that he was the first black character since X 's death in season four , while not positive towards the character 's development during the ninth season and the season overall . Writing for Cinefantastique about the character 's introduction , Paul Vitaris called Pickens \" a fine addition to the cast \" of the series , describing his portrayal of Kersh as \" a strong presence \" . However , during a review of the eighth season two years later , Vitaris described Kersh as \" one of the most one-note characters yet \" on the series . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X-Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , describe Kersh 's return in the eighth season as \" contrived but forgivable \" . Shearman and Pearson noted that the character is \" an effective obstruction to any number of X-Files cases , but he can hardly be considered a lead villain \" . In 1999 , Pickens was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series for his work as Kersh , alongside Gillian Anderson , William B. Davis , David Duchovny , Mitch Pileggi and Chris Owens .",

Unusually for an early cantata by Bach , the date of first performance is known : at the inauguration of a new town council on 4 February 1708 . The text is compiled mainly from biblical sources , three different sections from Psalm 74 and several other verses . In addition , one stanza from Johann Heermann 's hymn \" O Gott , du frommer Gott \" is sung simultaneously with corresponding biblical text , and free poetry by an unknown poet of Bach 's time which relates to the political occasion . The cantata in seven movements is scored festively with a Baroque instrumental ensemble including trumpets and timpani , \" four separate instrumental ' choirs ' , set against a vocal consort of four singers , an optional Capelle of ripienists and an organ \" . Stylistically it shares features with Bach 's other early cantatas . Bach , then organist in M\u00fchlhausen 's church Divi Blasii , led the performance on 4 February 1708 in the town 's main church , the Marienkirche . Although the cantata was planned to be performed only twice , it was printed the same year , the first of his works to be printed and the only cantata extant in print that was printed in Bach 's lifetime . = = History and words = = From 1707 to 1708 , Bach was the organist at one of M\u00fchlhausen 's principal churches , Divi Blasii , dedicated to St Blaise , where he composed some of his earliest surviving cantatas . One or two early cantatas , for example Nach dir , Herr , verlanget mich , BWV 150 , may have been written at Arnstadt , his previous residence , for a performance at M\u00fchlhausen . He composed Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig for a church service that was held annually to celebrate the inauguration of a new town council . The librettist is unknown ; it has been speculated that the text was written by Georg Christian Eilmar , minister of Marienkirche , who had earlier prompted the composition of Bach 's cantata Aus der Tiefen rufe ich , Herr , zu dir , BWV 131 . It has also been thought that Bach himself may have assembled the text , although the suggestion is unlikely since Bach 's musical setting of the final part of the text departs from its bi-strophic form . There is no evidence either way to indicate the authorship of the cantata 's text . Along with other early cantatas , Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig is of a pre-Neumeister character , not featuring the combination of recitative and arias found in later cantatas . The service was held on 4 February 1708 in the Marienkirche , the town 's largest church . The score indicates that Bach deployed his musicians in different locations in the building . He composed another cantata for the occasion the following year , but it is lost . = = = Theme = = = The text centres on Psalm 74 , with additional material drawn from the 2 Samuel , Genesis , and Deuteronomy . Unusual for Bach 's early cantatas , some contemporary unknown poet added free text that makes reference to the \" new regiment \" of office bearers and the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany , Joseph I , as M\u00fchlhausen was an Imperial free city , thus subject immediately to the emperor . There are three quotations from Psalm 74 ( Psalms 74 ) : Verse 12 : \" Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig von Alters her , der alle H\u00fclffe thut , so auf Erden geschicht . \" ( \" God is my Sovereign since ancient days , who all salvation brings which on earth may be found . \" \u2013 ASV version : \" Yet God is my King of old , Working salvation in the midst of the earth . \" ) Verses 16 \u2013 17 : \" Tag und Nacht ist dein . Du machest , da\u00df beyde Sonn und Gestirn ihren gewissen Lauf haben . Du setzest einem jeglichen Lande seine Gr\u00e4ntze . \" ( \" Day and night are Yours . You have seen to it that both sun and planets have their certain courses . You set borders to every land . \" \u2013 ASV : \" The day is thine , the night also is thine : Thou hast prepared the light and the sun . Thou hast set all the borders of the earth . \" ) Verse 19 : \" Du wollest dem Feinde nicht geben die Seele deiner Turteltauben . \" ( \" You would not give the soul of Your turtledove to the enemy . \" \u2013 ASV : \" Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast . \" ) It has been suggested that these themes include a number of distinct allusions of relevance to the inhabitants of M\u00fchlhausen . First , the reference to Psalm 74 in general , and the inclusion of verse 19 in the cantata may be making an oblique reference , accessible to contemporary audiences , to the fire of May 1707 which had destroyed parts of the city . The importance of \" borders \" may be an allusion to the threat to the city 's independence posed by the military campaigns of Charles XII . Movement 2 combines three texts , two biblical verses and stanza 6 from Johann Heermann 's hymn \" O Gott , du frommer Gott \" , which all make reference to old age . An older view suggested this was likely a reference to the septuagenarian Conrad Meckbach , a member of the city council who was connected to Bach . More recent research lead to thinking that it likely refers to Adolf Strecker , the former mayor who had just left office aged 83 years , since \" details of his public and private life match extremely well with the texts chosen for the cantata , and it seems likely that hearers would have recognized Strecker in them \" . = = Structure and scoring = = Bach structured the cantata in seven movements . He scored the vocal parts for four soloists : soprano , alto , tenor and bass . The choral writing is in four parts , and the work can be sung with just four singers , the so-called OVPP approach . Some performances deploy more singers in the choral sections . The use of a larger choir is partly a question of balance with the relatively large instrumental forces , but there is also supporting evidence for the use of more than four singers in the score , where a marking implies that Bach envisaged the option of a vocal ensemble that is separate from the four soloists . This was Bach 's first cantata for festive orchestra , including trumpets and timpani . The instruments are divided into four spatially separated \" choirs \" , placing the work in the polychoral tradition associated with composers such as Heinrich Sch\u00fctz . The instruments required for the Baroque instrumental ensemble are three trumpets ( Tr ) , timpani ( Ti ) , two recorders ( Fl ) , two oboes ( Ob ) , bassoon ( Fg ) , organ obbligato ( Org ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , viola da gamba ( Vg ) and basso continuo . In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D\u00fcrr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown . = = Music = = With short movements that flow into each other , the cantata shows typical characteristics of traditional 17th-century cantatas . Unlike other early cantatas , it has no instrumental introduction . John Eliot Gardiner , who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 and performed this cantata in the M\u00fchlhausen church where Bach was organist , notes : No other work of his is laid out on such a grand scale in terms of its deployment of four separate instrumental ' choirs ' , set against a vocal consort of four singers , an optional Capelle of ripienists and an organ . A model for such \" theatrical splendour \" were oratorios by Dieterich Buxtehude , performed in Bach 's presence at the L\u00fcbeck in 1705 . = = = 1 = = = The opening chorus , Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig von altersher ( God is my King from long ago ) , is based on Psalm 74 : 12 . It begins with a chord in C major from the instruments . The first line is repeated separationg sections and as a summary at the end , accompanied always by a trumpet fanfare . = = = 2 = = = An aria for tenor , Ich bin nun achtzig Jahr , warum soll dein Knecht sich mehr beschweren ? ( I am now eighty years old , why shall Your servant burden himself any more ? ) is complimented by a hymn , sung simultaneously by the soprano , Soll ich auf dieser Welt mein Leben h\u00f6her bringen ( Should I upon this earth carry my life farther ) . All texts deal with old age . The section begins with the image of a descending continuo line . The tenor melody expresses sadness about the condition of old age . The chorale tune , sung with embellishments is not the most usual one for the hymn , possibly chosen to match the theme . = = = 3 = = = Another choral movement , Dein Alter sei wie deine Jugend , und Gott ist mit dir in allem , das du tust ( May your old age be like your youth , and God is with you in everything that you do ) sets more biblical passages , assuring that God is with people both old and young . It is set as a permutation fuge . = = = 4 = = = A bass arioso sets two more verses from the psalm , Tag und Nacht ist dein ( Day and night are Yours ) . In ternary form , the outer sections are a sarabande , dealing with day and night , while the middle section describes light and sun , with joyful motif in the continuo and word-painting in the voice . = = = 5 = = = An alto aria , Durch m\u00e4chtige Kraft erh\u00e4ltst du unsre Grenzen ( Through powerful strength You maintain our borders ) is based on contemporary poetry . Set in C major with the trumpets and timpani as the only obbligato instruments , it is in two sections : the first in triple time marked Vivace corresponds to God 's power and glory , while the second in common time is a prayer for peace on Earth . = = = 6 = = = Another psalm verse is again set as a chorus , Du wollest dem Feinde nicht geben die Seele deiner Turteltauben ( You would not give the soul of Your turtledove to the enemy ) . The voices are set in homophony on a cello in ondulating motion . Gardiner notes that it is very personal setting , \" is a movement of extraordinary reticence , delicacy and the utmost tonal subtlety \" . He notes an upward semitone as a feature to express both yearningand the sound of the turtledove . The instruments are grouped to achieve in subtle colour : recorders and cello , reeds , and strings . = = = 7 = = = The last chorus Das neue Regiment ( The new regime ) expresses wishes for peace and well-being under the new council . = = Importance = = Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig is a significant early work of Bach . It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach 's time in M\u00fchlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation . It was so positively received that it was the first of Bach 's works to be printed ( paid for by the city council ) ; it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime , at least in a version which has survived to this day . The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance , and a new piece was commissioned the following year . Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year 's council inauguration ; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed , but no copies are known to survive . = = Selected recordings = = The selection is taken from the listing by Aryeh Oron on the Bach-Cantatas website . Choirs and orchestras are roughly marked as large by red background ; green background indicates vocalists with one voice per part ( OVPP ) and instrumental groups playing period instruments in historically informed performances .",

Prior to playing professionally , deGrom attended Stetson University and played college baseball for the Stetson Hatters . DeGrom began playing baseball as a shortstop and was converted into a pitcher during his junior year at Stetson . The Mets selected him in the ninth round of the 2010 MLB Draft , and he made his MLB debut with the Mets on May 15 , 2014 . That year , deGrom was named the National League 's ( NL ) Rookie of the Month twice , and the NL Rookie of the Year . In 2015 , deGrom was selected as an MLB All-Star . = = Amateur career = = DeGrom attended Calvary Christian Academy in Ormond Beach , Florida , where he played for the school 's baseball and basketball teams . As a senior , the Florida Sports Writers Association named deGrom to the All-Florida second team . He also played American Legion baseball , where he was noticed by the coaches for the Stetson Hatters , the college baseball team of Stetson University . DeGrom was not selected in the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft out of high school . He enrolled at Stetson University and joined their baseball team where he played exclusively as a shortstop during his freshman and sophomore seasons . Though he was considered a good fielder with a strong throwing arm , deGrom was a light hitter , with a career .263 batting average . He made his first appearance as a pitcher in May 2009 . In the summer of 2009 , between his sophomore and junior years , deGrom received an invitation to play collegiate summer baseball for the DeLand Suns of the Florida Collegiate Summer League , which he declined after discovering that they wanted him to play as a pitcher . When deGrom returned to Stetson that fall , the team used him as a relief pitcher , filling the role of their closer , in addition to playing shortstop . He quickly became one of Stetson 's best pitchers , so the team moved deGrom into their starting rotation midway through the season . In addition to a fastball , deGrom learned to throw a changeup and a slider . MLB scouts began to take notice of deGrom when he pitched against Chris Sale of Florida Gulf Coast University . In that game , deGrom hit his only home run of the season . He made 12 starts for the Hatters , pitching to a 4 \u2013 5 win \u2013 loss record with a 4.48 earned run average . = = Professional career = = = = = Minor League Baseball = = = The New York Mets selected deGrom in the ninth round as a pitcher , with the 272nd overall selection , of the 2010 MLB Draft .

He attempted to rehabilitate his arm for four months , but underwent Tommy John surgery to repair the UCL in October . He did not pitch in 2011 while he recovered from the surgery . While rehabilitating , deGrom worked on his changeup with Johan Santana . DeGrom pitched for the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League and the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2012 , finishing the year with a 2.43 ERA in 19 games started . In 2013 , he began the season with St. Lucie , but was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern League after two starts due to injuries to Binghamton 's Luis Mateo and Cory Mazzoni . He received a promotion to the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in June after the Mets promoted Zack Wheeler and Carlos Torres to the major leagues and traded Collin McHugh . He had a combined 4.51 ERA for the season , due to a broken finger suffered during the offseason , which altered the way he threw the ball . The Mets added deGrom to their 40-man roster on November 20 , 2013 , to protect him from being eligible in the Rule 5 draft . During the offseason , deGrom improved his mechanics , and learned to throw a curveball .

DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field . He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley , also making his MLB debut . He pitched seven innings , allowing only one run and striking out six , but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1 \u2013 0 . DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat . It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak , the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history . DeGrom compiled four quality starts in his first four MLB starts , but did not record a win in any of them . On July 8 , deGrom pitched seven scoreless innings and recorded 11 strikeouts in giving the Mets their 4,000th franchise victory .

                "Pat Collins = Tharon Leslie \" Pat \" Collins ( September 13 , 1896 \u2013 May 20 , 1960 ) was an American baseball catcher who played ten seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . He played for the St. Louis Browns , New York Yankees and Boston Braves from 1919 to 1929 . He batted and threw right-handed and also played five games at first base . Collins played minor league baseball for the Joplin Miners until 1919 , when he signed with the St. Louis Browns . After spending six seasons with the organization , Collins spent a one-year sojourn in the minor leagues before he was traded to the New York Yankees , where he spent the next three years and played in the famous 1927 Murderers ' Row lineup . At the conclusion of the 1928 season , he was traded to the Boston Braves , with whom he played his last game on May 23 , 1929 . A two-time World Series champion , he is famous for being the only major league player to pinch hit and pinch run in the same game . = = Personal life = = Collins was born on September 13 , 1896 in Sweet Springs , Missouri . His mother , Sarah , ran a boarding house , and he had three siblings : Ola , Mildred , and Rathal . He attended school in Sweet Springs before moving to Kansas City , Kansas to play sandlot ball . He was married to Daisy C. Collins . During his time with the Yankees , his teammate Babe Ruth \u2014 who usually called everyone \" Kid \" due to his inability to remember people 's names \u2014 mockingly gave Collins the nickname \" Horse Nose \" . After his major league career ended , he went on to run a restaurant in Kansas City , then operate a tavern in Lawrence , Kansas until 1952 . In April 1952 , the state of Kansas took Collins to court over alleged unpaid federal income tax from 1945 to 1950 . Although he was convicted in December of evading $ 4,037 , a federal judge ordered a new trial after evidence emerged showing his friend had deposited $ 48,300 in a safety deposit box for him . After being treated for a heart condition , Collins died in his sleep on May 20 , 1960 in Kansas City at the age of 63 and was interred at the city 's Memorial Park Cemetery . = = Professional career = = = = = Minor leagues = = = Collins began his professional baseball career in 1917 with the Joplin Miners , a minor league baseball team that were members of the Class A Western League . In 1919 , his last season with the Miners , he had a breakthrough year , posting a batting average .316 and amassing 100 hits , 19 doubles and 10 home runs in 96 games played . This caught the attention of the St. Louis Browns , who signed him near the end of the season . = = = St. Louis Browns ( 1919 \u2013 24 ) = = = Collins made his major league debut for the Browns on September 5 , 1919 , at the age of 22 , entering the game as a pinch-hitter for pitcher Bert Gallia and drawing a walk in a 12 \u2013 3 loss against the Detroit Tigers . Between 1920 and 1922 , he never played more than 31 games nor started more than 20 games a season as catcher , and his role was limited to occasional pinch-hitting appearances . During the 1923 season , Collins played 47 games ( 37 starts ) and had the fifth highest caught stealing percentage in the American League ( AL ) at 44.4 % . During a June 8 road game at Shibe Park , he became the first and only major league player to pinch hit and pinch run in the same game . His teammate Homer Ezzell reached base in the third inning , but needed to use the restroom . Collins was inserted into the game as a pinch runner until Ezzell returned . In the ninth inning , Collins returned to pinch hit for pitcher Ray Kolp after the Philadelphia Athletics ' manager Connie Mack agreed to drop the no free substitution rule and allowed Collins to pinch hit . However , the official box score lists his pinch hit appearance only . In 1924 , there were two factors which limited Collins to just 20 games ( 11 starts ) as catcher . Firstly , he dislocated the joint in his left thumb during spring training after splitting the finger . Then on June 22 , Collins \u2014 along with Browns manager George Sisler and coach Jimmy Austin \u2014 were suspended indefinitely after arguing balls and strikes with the umpire . Sisler lodged a formal protest to AL president Ban Johnson , and the suspensions were rescinded four days later . After the season ended , Collins was not re-signed by the Browns , so he spent the 1925 season with the St. Paul Saints , a minor league baseball team that competed in the American Association ( AA ) . There , he batted .316 and hit 19 home runs in 132 games . = = = New York Yankees ( 1926 \u2013 28 ) = = = The Saints traded Collins to the New York Yankees on August 30 , 1925 , in exchange for $ 25,000 and three players to be named later ( the Yankees later sent Pee-Wee Wanninger to St. Paul on December 16 ) . During his years with the team , he developed a reputation of being slow-footed and having a throwing arm that was described as \" terrible \" and \" weak \" . However , his steadiness behind the plate and his bat kept him in lineup . He became the starting catcher \" by default \" after Benny Bengough \u2014 who was Miller Huggins ' first choice for the job \u2014 suffered from a sore arm before spring training commenced . In his first season with the organization , Collins had the fourth highest on-base percentage ( .433 ) and tenth best at bats per home run ratio ( 41.4 ) in the AL , though he also recorded the fifth highest number of strikeouts in the league with 57 . Defensively , he played the fourth highest number of games at catcher ( 100 ) , during which he finished second in errors committed by a catcher ( 14 ) , fifth in passed balls ( 6 ) and fourth in stolen bases allowed in the AL . However , he compensated for this by turning the most double plays ( 14 ) and recording the second highest range factor ( 4.75 ) as catcher , while finishing fourth in putouts ( 401 ) and fifth in assists ( 74 ) at his position and catching the fifth highest number of baserunners stealing ( 34 ) . On July 20 , in the final game of a series against the Browns ( his former team ) , Collins injured a side ligament while attempting to run down catcher Wally Schang , who was also facing his former team . This , along with Bengough 's recurring problems with his arm , prompted the Yankees to buy Hank Severeid from the Washington Senators . In the postseason , the Yankees advanced to the 1926 World Series , where they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games . Collins did not receive much playing time throughout the series , appearing in just three games and getting no hits and one strikeout in two plate appearances . The 1927 season saw Collins split catching duties with Johnny Grabowski and Bengough . He appeared in the most games behind the plate out of the three players \u2013 89 games caught by Collins versus 68 by Grabowski and Bengough 's 30 . He was usually placed near the bottom of the Yankees lineup , which was given the nickname \" Murderers ' Row \" . Many sports analysts , baseball writers and fans consider the 1927 team the greatest baseball team of all time . Although Collins was labelled an \" offensive afterthought \" , he still managed to bat a respectable .275 and drove in 36 runs in 311 plate appearances . Defensively , he once again finished fourth in the AL in number of games ( 89 ) and putouts ( 267 ) at catcher , while also recording the fourth highest fielding percentage at the position ( .976 ) . At the end of the year , the Yankees once again advanced to the World Series , where they swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games . Collins played in Games 1 and 4 ; in the first game , he was hitless in two at bats but garnered two walks , while in the latter game he went 3-for-3 with a double . His series average of .600 was the highest among his teammates . After the Yankees purchased Bill Dickey from the Jackson Senators before the start of the 1928 season , the team now had four catchers on their roster . The increase competition restricted Collins to 45 starts and 70 games in total . In the 1928 World Series , the Yankees achieved a second consecutive Fall Classic sweep , this time against the Cardinals in a rematch of the series from two years before . However , he played just one game in the series , entering the 7th inning of Game 4 as a defensive substitute and hitting a double two innings later . The catching situation \u2014 along with his dismal .221 batting average that year \u2014 made Collins redundant , and at the end of the season , he was sold to the Boston Braves . = = = Boston Braves and back to the minors ( 1929 \u2013 32 ) = = = Collins managed to play just seven games for the Braves during the 1929 season , making his final major league appearance on May 23 . During his brief tenure with the team , he was hitless , but drove in 2 runs , drew 3 walks and had 3 sacrifice bunts in 11 plate appearances . After the Braves acquired several younger catchers , he was released and sent to the Buffalo Bisons of the Class AAA International League There , he batted .122 and had 5 hits in 16 games played before manager Bill Clymer cut him loose after the season ended . He promptly signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Indians , a minor league team that played in the Class AAA Pacific Coast League . He batted .244 during his stint with the team and was traded midway through the 1930 season to the Kansas City Blues , thus returning to the AA . His numbers improved tremendously \u2014 he recorded a .358 batting average , amassed 39 hits and slugged 7 doubles and 3 home runs in 109 at bats . The 1931 season saw Collins play just 27 games with the Blues and his average dipped to .182 . He was scheduled to be traded to the Omaha Packers in July , but the deal fell through and he remained with the team through to the 1932 season . That year , he played 105 games and batted .268 , collected 78 hits with 14 doubles , 3 triples and 4 home runs before retiring from professional baseball at the end of the season . = = Post-playing career = = After playing his final major league season in 1929 , Collins returned to minor league baseball and played for several teams until 1932 . In 1936 , he teamed up with former minor league pitcher Van Hammer in attempting to establish a new Western League franchise in St. Joseph , Missouri , after the St. Joseph Saints moved to Waterloo , Iowa and became the Waterloo Hawks . However , the plan fell through after a court injunction was issued barring him from using the stadium in St. Joseph for professional baseball . Because of this , Collins forfeited the St. Joseph franchise and subsequently bought the Western League 's Rock Island Islanders instead .",

After leading all Broward County high school players in batting average ( .573 ) , home runs ( 14 ) and runs batted in ( RBIs ) ( 48 ) as a senior , Mottola was named to Florida 's Class 3A All-State first team . Out of high school , the Baltimore Orioles selected Mottola in the tenth round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft , with the 243rd overall selection . Mottola did not sign with the Orioles , opting to pursue a college baseball career . Mottola then enrolled at the University of Central Florida ( UCF ) , which he chose to attend over the University of New Orleans , as it was closer to his home . At UCF , he played for the UCF Knights baseball team in NCAA 's Division I. As a freshman , he hit .321 in 57 games , but did not hit a home run .

He was the first UCF athlete to be selected in the first round of an MLB draft . In his first professional season , Mottola led the Billings Mustangs to the Pioneer League championship , batting .286 with 12 home runs and 37 runs batted in ( RBIs ) .

Mottola started the 1995 season with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class-AA Southern League , receiving a promotion to the Class-AAA Indianapolis Indians of the International League that season . Despite his minor league success , Mottola 's path to the Reds was blocked by outfielders Reggie Sanders , Curtis Goodwin , Eric Davis , Vince Coleman , Mike Kelly , Steve Gibraltar and Eric Anthony , all of whom the Reds had in spring training that season . General Manager Jim Bowden commented that Mottola needed more minor league seasoning before he would be promoted to the Reds .

The Reds added Deion Sanders and Rub\u00e9n Sierra to their outfield competition for the 1997 season , prompting Mottola to question the Reds commitment to him . After he spent the 1997 season in the minors , the Reds traded Mottola to the Texas Rangers for a player to be named later in April 1998 . He spent most of the 1998 season with the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) , but suffered a broken thumb that required surgery , limiting his season .

                "Russ Christopher = Russell Ormand Christopher ( September 12 , 1917 \u2013 December 5 , 1954 ) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for seven seasons in the American League with the Philadelphia Athletics and Cleveland Indians . In 241 career games , Christopher pitched 999 \u2154 innings and posted a win-loss record of 54 \u2013 64 , with 46 complete games , three shutouts , and a 3.37 earned run average ( ERA ) . A 6 ' 3 , 180 lb. player from Richmond , California , he played minor league baseball in the New York Yankees organization before being acquired by the Athletics in the rule 5 draft . Christopher joined the Athletics ' major league roster in 1942 and played six seasons for them , and made his only All-Star appearance in 1945 . He was traded to the Indians before the 1948 season , and played one year of baseball with them . After the season ended , he retired due to health concerns and worked at an aircraft plant until his death in 1954 . = = Early life and minor leagues = = Christopher was born in Richmond , California . His brother , Loyd Christopher , went on to become a major league outfielder . Loyd was the one first interested in becoming a professional baseball player , but would not sign a contract unless Russ signed one as well . As a child , Christopher had a case of rheumatic fever , which damaged his heart . He had his first taste of professional baseball in 1938 , when he signed with the Clovis Pioneers of the West Texas \u2013 New Mexico League . He pitched in 13 games for the pioneers , posting a 7 \u2013 5 record , 106 innings pitched and a 4.50 ERA . The following year , Christopher joined the El Paso Texans , the rookie-level minor league team of the New York Yankees farm system . In 32 games with the Texans , he posted an 18 \u2013 7 record , pitched 225 innings and had an ERA of 3.68 . He was promoted in 1940 to the Wenatchee Chiefs of the Western International League , where he finished the year with an 8 \u2013 8 record and a 4.72 ERA in 20 games . At the end of the season , he was promoted to the Newark Bears of the International League along with seven other minor league players . In his lone season with the Bears , Christopher pitched in 31 games . Among those games was a four-hit shutout against the Rochester Red Wings in the International League playoffs to put the Bears up two games to none . In the championship series against the Montreal Royals , Christopher pitched seven solid innings in a victory for the Bears , but injured his back and did not play another game that season . He finished the season with a 16 \u2013 7 record , a 2.82 ERA and 12 complete games . At the conclusion of the season , Christopher was considered the top prospect in the rule 5 draft , and the Philadelphia Athletics selected him with the first pick of the draft . = = Philadelphia Athletics = = After pitching with the Athletics in spring training , manager Connie Mack placed Christopher on the major league roster , and he made his debut on April 14 , 1942 . On May 5 , Christopher made his first appearance as a starting pitcher against the Detroit Tigers . The Athletics won the game , 2 \u2013 1 , and he got his first major league win . After another win five days later , he began a long losing streak . Many of the games he did pitch were in relief , including a game in June against the Cleveland Indians where he only allowed one hit in three innings . He got his third win of the season three months after his second on August 20 in a 2 \u2013 1 victory over the Washington Nationals . He finished the season with a 4 \u2013 13 record , a 3.82 ERA , 30 total games , 58 strikeouts and 99 walks . The following season , Christopher re-signed with the Athletics , and was one of the few remaining pitchers from the previous year on the team , the rest having been called to serve in World War II . He began the season in the starting rotation , winning his first start of the season against the Boston Red Sox in a 5 \u2013 0 shutout . Over the course of the season , he converted to a sidearm pitching delivery , which led to three victories in a row for him . After a July 9 loss to the Tigers brought his record to 4 \u2013 6 , Christopher did not pitch again until August 24 , and spent the rest of the season pitching in relief . He finished the season with a 5 \u2013 8 record and a 3.45 ERA . Christopher began the 1944 Philadelphia Athletics season as a member of the starting rotation along with Don Black , Lum Harris and Bobo Newsom . However , he did split time in the first half of the year between the starting rotation and the bullpen . Among those appearances was a 16-inning match against the Chicago White Sox ; Christopher pitched the final four innings , losing 4 \u2013 2 after Hal Trosky stole home plate . On July 14 , he pitched a 4 \u2013 3 victory against the Senators , helping his team defeat Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn for the first time in three years . After starting the season with a 4 \u2013 10 record , on July 22 Christopher went on a seven-game winning streak that culminated with a 5 \u2013 1 complete game victory over the White Sox . He finished the season with a 14 \u2013 14 record , 84 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.97 . After the season ended , Christopher and others went on a barnstorming tour throughout the United States , ending in Wenatchee , Washington . The following season , Christopher was part of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team , so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher , Black , Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league . He spent most of spring training holding out for a new contract , which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March . He missed the first couple weeks of the season due to injury , and won his season debut on April 18 , a 12-inning shutout against the Senators . He followed that up with a victory over the Boston Red Sox , allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season . In mid-June , Christopher had won ten games , which not only led the league , but was more than the seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined . On July 21 , Christopher was part of a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1 \u2013 1 tie ; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11 . Although Christopher had a strong start to the season , he struggled during the second half . He lost seven straight games over a two-month period before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers . He finished the year with a 13 \u2013 13 record and a 3.17 ERA . He was selected to the American League All-Star team , however the game was canceled as a result of World War II . The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics season began with Christopher the subject of a possible trade . The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees , but they wanted Christopher in return . Mack refused to give him up , and as a result the trade never materialized . He began the season in the starting rotation , and was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5 \u2013 0 loss against the Yankees . Over the first part of the season , Christopher again split time between the rotation and the bullpen . In a 7 \u2013 3 loss to the Indians on July 18 , Christopher could not get out of the second inning , allowing five earned runs . After this , he did not pitch for a month , and spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever . He finished the season with five wins , seven losses and a 4.30 ERA . After the season ended , Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball . He had lost 10 pounds in the final months of the season and was light to begin with , and decided that he would retire if he could not gain the weight back over the winter . Christopher gained the weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season . While there was talk of keeping him in the rotation , he ended up becoming a full-time reliever for the team . Despite this , Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat ; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox . Over the course of the season , Christopher evolved into the Athletics ' closer , finishing the games when the team 's pitchers could not go the distance . He finished the season having played 44 games , finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process . He also had 10 wins , seven losses , and a 2.90 ERA . At the end of the season , Christopher was holding out on his contract , wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever . The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February , and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season . = = Cleveland Indians = = While Christopher was holding out for a new deal from the Athletics , he was also trying to gain weight . He went to around 40 banquets on behalf of Connie Mack during the offseason , and despite his eating habits , he remained at 170 pounds , not gaining an ounce . After apparently reaching an agreement with the Athletics , Christopher was purchased by the Cleveland Indians on April 3 , 1948 . While the deal was made between Mack and Indians owner Bill Veeck , Mack said he would not have made it unless Christopher consented to it , which he did not expect to happen . Indians manager Lou Boudreau reacted positively to the trade and felt that he was the missing piece for a pennant run . He said of the trade , \" With Christopher on out staff , we 're definitely contenders . \" While Christopher was hoping to start , the Indians felt , like the Athletics , that he would be better as a relief pitcher for them . Early in the season , Christopher told Veeck that 1948 would be his final year , as his wife joined the doctors ' side , wanting him to retire and noting that he was playing on \" borrowed time \" already . He spent the season as the Indians ' chief relief pitcher alongside Ed Klieman , both of whom were considered two of the best relievers in the league that season . Christopher finished the season with 45 games played , a 3 \u2013 2 record , a 2.90 ERA , and 17 saves , which led the league . In the 1948 World Series , he pitched in game five , facing Mike McCormick and Eddie Stanky . He allowed singles to both hitters and allowed two runs to score , and was relieved by Satchel Paige , ending his only playoff appearance . After the World Series ended , Christopher mulled over retirement , and in January 1949 , he made it official . However , at the start of February , he reconsidered and signed a contract with the Indians , deciding to play for one more year . A month later , as spring training began , he decided to retire for good , ending his career in baseball . = = Later life = = After retiring , Christopher moved to San Diego , where he lived with his wife and three children . In December 1950 , Christopher underwent heart surgery , and afterward felt optimistic about the possibility of pitching again . After a tryout with the Indians in 1951 , he joined the San Diego Padres for a salary of $ 1 a year . He spent several weeks training with the team , but was eventually released at the end of April , ending his comeback attempt . When his final attempt at a comeback failed , Christopher went on to work in an aircraft plant in San Diego . He died in his hometown of Richmond , California , at the age of 37 on December 5 , 1954 and is interred at Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland , California . Russ ' youngest daughter , Lynn Mary Christopher , born August 10 , 1950 , lives 6 months in San Diego County , and 6 months in Prescott , Arizona .",
                "H\u00e9ctor L\u00f3pez = H\u00e9ctor Headley L\u00f3pez Swainson ( born July 9 , 1929 ( possibly April 8 , 1932 ) ) is a former left fielder and third baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Kansas City Athletics and New York Yankees from 1955 to 1966 . He is notable as the first black manager at the AAA baseball level , as the third outfielder on the Maris / Mantle Yankees , and as the Kansas City Athletics franchise hitting streak record holder . L\u00f3pez was on World Series Championship teams for the Yankees in 1961 and 1962 . In various seasons , he finished among the top 10 American League hitters in hits , runs batted in , runs scored , doubles , triples , slugging percentage , sacrifice flies , sacrifice hits , games played , times hit by pitch and at bats . He was also known for his hustle , his clutch hitting and poor fielding . L\u00f3pez was the second Panamanian-born major league baseball player and continues to be one of the country 's most revered world champion athletes . Although Humberto Robinson ( 102 games played / 5 seasons ) debuted in the major leagues 22 days earlier than L\u00f3pez , L\u00f3pez ( 1,450 games played / 12 seasons ) was the first of the 49 major leaguers born in Panama to have an extensive career . He was the first Panamanian-born major leaguer to finish in the top 10 in any official statistical category ( sacrifice hits , 1956 ) ; first to lead his league in any official statistic ( sacrifice flies , 1958 ) ; first to play in the World Series ( with the 1960 Yankees ) ; and the first to win a World Championship ( with the 1961 Yankees ) . He was an infielder for the Athletics , and later was often the third outfielder on the Maris / Mantle Yankees of the early and mid-1960s . L\u00f3pez had his most successful season in 1959 , but continued to contribute effectively during the early 1960s during their pennant successes . The utility player divided his career almost equally between infield and outfield positions . After retiring from baseball , he went on to become a groundbreaking manager in minor league baseball as the first to break the baseball color line as a black manager at the AAA level for the Buffalo Bisons and then served in various international managerial and coaching positions . = = Early life = = Born in Col\u00f3n , Panama , L\u00f3pez grew up in Col\u00f3n and the neighboring Panama Canal Zone . He held a part-time job at an American military base bowling alley . He was a high school track star whose father had been a pitcher for the Panama national baseball team . As a high school athlete , he played semipro baseball for US $ 100 per month in Col\u00f3n . After he graduated from high school he signed to play with St. Hyacinthe of the Canadian Provincial League who also employed Clifford \" Connie \" Johnson . = = Kansas City Athletics ( 1955 \u2013 59 ) = = Prior to the 1952 season , L\u00f3pez was acquired by the Philadelphia Athletics from the Drummondville Cubs of the Class-C Provincial League for $ 1,500 ( $ 13,367 today ) . In 1954 , L\u00f3pez won baseball 's Triple Crown in the Winter League . Throughout his professional career , he played in the Panama winter league where he won three batting titles and regularly led the league in home runs . L\u00f3pez developed in the A 's farm system , and when the team relocated to Kansas City in 1955 he was recalled to the major league club . L\u00f3pez made his major league debut in 1955 . That season he finished second to Carlos Paula among rookies in batting average and was overshadowed by American League strikeout-leading pitcher Herb Score for the Rookie of the Year . He usually played second or third base during his time with the Athletics . During his rookie season , he finished third on the team in home runs , trailing only Gus Zernial ( 30 ) and Vic Power ( 19 ) . He tied Jim Finigan for third on the team in RBIs with 68 , trailing only Zernial and Power , who had 84 and 76 , respectively . L\u00f3pez was the team 's regular third baseman , and was the youngest regular starter on the team . In 1956 , the team finished with a 52 \u2013 102 record , but L\u00f3pez had a career-high 153 hits . He also set then-career highs in home runs ( 18 ) and runs batted in ( 69 ) . In his early years , black and white players did not room together on the road , so he roomed with Vic Power even though Power 's closest friend on the team was Clete Boyer . In 1957 , he had a 22-game hitting streak , that is the All-time Kansas City Athletics team record for the thirteen seasons the franchise played there . He earned a position in the top-10 in the American League in both games played and at bats in 1956 and 1958 , as well as leading the AL in sacrifice flies and times grounded into double plays in 1958 . L\u00f3pez also was in the top 10 in doubles and runs scored in 1958 and in sacrifice hits in 1956 . On June 26 , 1958 , L\u00f3pez hit three home runs in a game against the Washington Senators . During his career with the Athletics , he hit .278 with 67 home runs and 269 RBIs , and scored 298 runs . However , his talents were wasted on a team that never finished above 6th place . On May 26 , 1959 , he was traded with Ralph Terry to the New York Yankees for Johnny Kucks , Tom Sturdivant , and Jerry Lumpe . For all his offensive skills , L\u00f3pez led American League third basemen in errors in each of his four full seasons in Kansas City . Baseball writer and Kansas City Athletics fan Bill James wrote that L\u00f3pez was as bad a defensive player as you would ever want to see . The Authors of The Great American Baseball Card Flipping , Trading and Bubble Gum Book wrote of L\u00f3pez 's defense \" I would like to go on record right here and now as declaring Hector L\u00f3pez the all-time worst fielding major league ballplayer . \" = = New York Yankees ( 1959 \u2013 66 ) = = In his first season with the Yankees after being traded , he played 35 games in the outfield , the first time in his career he played more than 20 outfield games . He still played 76 games at third base for the team . In his 33 games with Kansas City at the start of the 1959 Major League Baseball season , he had played exclusively at second base . In his next five seasons with the Yankees from 1960 to 1964 , he mostly played in the outfield as he was part of five consecutive pennant winners . During his time with the Yankees , he was often the third outfielder of the Maris / Mantle Yankees that won two of the five consecutive World Series they played in from 1960 to 1964 . He logged the most games in left field during the back-to-back World Series Championship seasons of 1961 & 1962 ( 129 vs. Berra-109 , Tresh-43 ) . During the five pennant years , with Roger Maris playing right field and Mickey Mantle playing center field , L\u00f3pez logged 406 games in left field . This was the most by any Yankee during this period ( Tom Tresh-195 , Yogi Berra-129 ) . L\u00f3pez is one of eleven Yankees to have been on these five consecutive pennant winners and along with Whitey Ford , Elston Howard , Bobby Richardson , & Clete Boyer is one of seven Yankees to have been part of the entire Maris / Mantle Yankee era . In 1965 and 1966 , he made the majority of his outfield appearances in right field . However , in 1965 Mantle did not play center field . Mantle did return to center field for the majority of his appearances in 1966 ( the final year of the Maris / Mantle Yankees and the final year of L\u00f3pez ' career ) . In 1959 , he finished in the top 10 in slugging percentage , hits , doubles and RBI . In 1960 he was among the top 10 in triples and sacrifice hits . During the 1961 World Series , L\u00f3pez replaced Mantle ( who only had six Series at bats ) in Game 4 and recorded a 2-run single on the way to a 7 \u2013 0 victory . In Game 5 , which was the Series-clinching game , he homered and tripled , driving in five runs , and caught Vada Pinson 's fly ball for the final out of the Series . His three for seven , 7 run batted in performance continues to be remembered by New Yorkers as a highlight of the series . = = Managing = = L\u00f3pez was the manager of the Buffalo Bisons in 1969 . This made him the first black manager at the AAA level . This was six years before Frank Robinson became the first black manager in the major leagues . L\u00f3pez was one of three black men ( along with Sam Bankhead and Gene Baker ) to manage in the minor leagues in the twenty-five years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947 . In 1990 , he coached Malverne High School of Malverne , New York in Nassau County on Long Island in addition to working in the parks department in the Town of Hempstead . L\u00f3pez has also managed in Venezuela and been a player-manager in Panama . He was the manager of the Panama national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic . = = Panamanian history = = He paved the way as a role model for the first three Panamanian Major League All-Stars , Ben Oglivie and Manny Sanguill\u00e9n also from Col\u00f3n , and Rod Carew a Colonense born in neighboring Gatun . L\u00f3pez recorded many firsts among Panamanian baseball players ; he was the first regular major leaguer , since 1955 was his rookie season , whereas Robinson did not qualify as a rookie until 1958 ( the season in which he recorded his 50th career inning pitched ) and Webbo Clarke , who also debuted in 1955 , never qualified as a rookie . L\u00f3pez ' 1955 rookie season , when he batted .290 , was also the first by a Panamanian to qualify for baseball 's statistical leadership by recording the minimum number of plate appearances or innings pitched . Thus , although he was not the first to appear in the major leagues , he was in a sense the first Panamanian everyday player . None of the other major leaguers born in Panama who played in the 1950s ( Robinson , Clarke , Pat Scantlebury , Tom Hughes ) played in the major league postseason , which then only included the World Series , before L\u00f3pez did so with the 1960 Yankees . No other Panamanian was part of a World Series champion before L\u00f3pez with the 1961 Yankees . He was the first Panamanian to record many statistical accomplishments , such as a stolen base , home run , double , triple , walk or strikeout . His 1956 season was the first by a Panamanian with more than 150 hits , more than 25 doubles , 90 runs scored , or more than 60 walks . His 1959 season was the first with more than 20 home runs or 90 runs batted in . L\u00f3pez twice had .350 on-base percentages , but in each season he recorded over 400 plate appearances without recording the qualifying number for unofficial league leadership . Thus , his career high on-base percentage in a season in which he qualified for statistical leadership was .347 in 1956 . He was the first to finish among the top 10 in his league in each of the aforementioned statistical categories , and the first to lead his league in any official statistical batting category ( sacrifice flies in 1958 ) . L\u00f3pez was the first Panamanian to accumulate a sufficient number of career appearances to qualify for career statistical leadership ( which depending upon the source is based on 3000 , 4000 or 5000 at bats ) , although his career .269 batting average , .330 on-base percentage and .415 slugging percentage are not historically significant . He also represented Panama in the 1960 Caribbean Series and tied with F\u00e9lix Torres and Herman Davis for the tournament home run leadership . He continues to be considered a legendary world champion who represented the country . In 2006 , he was cited by professional basketball coach , Joseph Clarke , as ranking alongside such noted Panamanian sports personalities as Ismael Laguna , Roberto Dur\u00e1n , and Mariano Rivera as Panamanian World Champions . L\u00f3pez has two sons . Ever since L\u00f3pez ' performances with the Yankees , the team has had a huge following in Panama . = = Post-playing career = = Lopez retired following the 1966 season at the age of 36 . That year , he also participated in his first Old-Timers ' Day . He has returned to the annual event every year ( totaling 49 years as of 2015 ) .",
                "Red Ruffing = Charles Herbert \" Red \" Ruffing ( May 3 , 1905 \u2013 February 17 , 1986 ) was an American professional baseball player . A pitcher , he played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) from 1924 through 1947 . He played for the Boston Red Sox , New York Yankees , and Chicago White Sox . Ruffing is most remembered for his time with the highly successful Yankees teams of the 1930s and 1940s . Ruffing dropped out of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his native Illinois . He played for the mine 's company baseball team as an outfielder and first baseman . After he lost four toes from his left foot in a mining accident , he became unable to run in the field , and switched to pitching . He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB debut with the Red Sox . After struggling with Boston , pitching to a 36 \u2013 93 win \u2013 loss record , the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees , where he became successful , pitching as the Yankees ' ace through 1946 . After one season with the White Sox , Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching . He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox , a pitching coach for the New York Mets , and a scout and minor league instructor for the Cleveland Indians . Ruffing was a member of six World Series championship teams with the Yankees . He also appeared in six MLB All-Star Games . He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1967 . The Yankees dedicated a plaque to Ruffing in Monument Park in 2004 . = = Early life = = Ruffing was born on May 3 , 1905 , in Granville , Illinois . He was one of five children . His parents , John and Louise Ruffing , emigrated to the United States from Germany . Ruffing was raised in Coalton , Illinois and Nokomis , Illinois . He went to school in Nokomis . His father was a coal miner , working in a mine in Coalton , Illinois , until he suffered a broken back . John became the superintendent of the mine , and also served as mayor of Coalton . Red quit school at the age of 13 to work for his father in the mine , earning $ 3 per day ( $ 47 in current dollar terms ) , working as a coupler . Conditions in the mine were dangerous . Red 's cousin , who also worked in the mine , died in an accident . He also played baseball as an outfielder and first baseman for the mine 's company team , and for a semi-professional team in Nokomis . When Ruffing was 15 years old , he suffered an accident in the mine , where his left foot was crushed between two cars . Though the doctor was able to save his foot , Red lost four toes . He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky \u2013 Illinois \u2013 Tennessee League that year , but he found himself unable to run as fast as he previously could . Doc Bennett , the manager of a nearby semi-professional team , suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher . = = Professional career = = = = = Minor leagues ( 1923 \u2013 24 ) = = = Bennett helped arrange for Ruffing to sign his first professional contract when he reached the age of 18 . Ruffing signed with the Danville Veterans of the Illinois \u2013 Indiana \u2013 Iowa League , a minor league baseball team in the Class B designation level . With Danville , Ruffing had a 12 \u2013 16 win \u2013 loss record . After pitching for Danville in the 1923 season , the Boston Red Sox purchased Ruffing from Danville for $ 4,000 ( $ 55,555 in current dollar terms ) . The Red Sox assigned Ruffing to the Dover Senators of the Class D Eastern Shore League to pitch at the start of the 1924 season . He had a 4 \u2013 7 record for Dover . = = = Major leagues = = = = = = = Boston Red Sox ( 1924 \u2013 30 ) = = = = Ruffing made his major league debut with the Red Sox on May 31 , 1924 . He pitched without earning a decision in over 23 innings pitched , and had a 6.65 earned run average ( ERA ) . He saw regular playing time with the Red Sox over the next few years but had limited success . He had a 9 \u2013 18 win-loss record with a 5.01 ERA in the 1925 season , as the Red Sox finished in last place in the eight team American League ( AL ) . Ruffing had a 6 \u2013 15 win-loss record and a 4.39 ERA in the 1926 season , and a 5 \u2013 13 win-loss record with a 4.66 ERA in the 1927 season , with the Red Sox finishing in last place both years . His best season to date , in terms of earned run performance , came in 1928 , when he posted a 3.89 ERA . However , he led the AL in earned runs allowed , with 125 , and had a 10 \u2013 25 win-loss record , which led the AL in losses . On a positive note , he also led the AL with 25 complete games . As Ruffing had a .314 batting average during the 1928 season , the Red Sox and Ruffing considered having him shift to the outfield . The team decided against a position change due to the limitations of Ruffing 's left foot . The Red Sox chose Ruffing to be their Opening Day starting pitcher for the 1929 season . During the 1929 season , he again led the AL in losses , with 22 , and earned runs , with 135 . He won only nine games . Ruffing often had difficulty pitching more than five innings in a game . Someone in the Red Sox organization suggested to Ruffing that he should try to gain weight by drinking beer , which saw him grow from 185 pounds ( 84 kg ) to 240 pounds ( 110 kg ) . During the 1930 season , Bob Quinn , the owner of the Red Sox , was in debt and afraid he would lose the team due to foreclosure . To raise capital , he traded Ruffing to the New York Yankees for reserve outfielder Cedric Durst , $ 50,000 ( $ 708,267 in current dollar terms ) , and a $ 50,000 loan from Jacob Ruppert , the Yankees ' owner . Ruffing ended his five-and-a-half year tenure with the Red Sox with a 39 \u2013 93 win-loss record ; his winning percentage ( .289 ) was lower than that of the Red Sox during his tenure ( .344 ) . = = = = New York Yankees = = = = = = = = = 1930 \u2013 38 = = = = = Miller Huggins , who served as the Yankees ' manager through 1929 , had attempted to acquire Ruffing from the Red Sox for the last couple years of his Yankees ' tenure . When Ruffing told him that he was considering moving to the outfield , Huggins told him he should continue as a pitcher . Bob Shawkey , a former pitcher who succeeded Huggins as the Yankees new manager in 1930 , had convinced Ed Barrow , the Yankees ' general manager , to acquire Ruffing . Shawkey believed he could change Ruffing 's approach to pitching to obtain better results . Shawkey worked with Ruffing to change his pitching delivery , so that Ruffing used his body more . This helped Ruffing save his arm strength for the later innings of the game . The trade of Ruffing for Durst is now reckoned as one of the most lopsided trades in baseball history ; Durst was a reserve outfielder who always batted at the bottom of the lineup when he was used . The 1930 season proved to be Durst 's last year in the majors . Ruffing had a 0 \u2013 3 record with the Red Sox before the trade . He won 15 games for the Yankees after the trade , losing only five games . The Yankees chose Ruffing as their starting pitcher for Opening Day in 1931 . During the 1931 season , Ruffing had a 16 \u2013 14 win-loss record with a 4.41 ERA . The Yankees finished the season in second place . On August 13 , 1932 , Ruffing threw a complete game shutout and hit a home run in the tenth inning off of Washington Senators ' pitcher Tommy Thomas to give the New York Yankees a 1 \u2013 0 victory . Ruffing became the first pitcher in major league history to win a game 1 \u2013 0 , hit a home run in the game , and strike out ten or more batters . Two other pitchers have since achieved this feat : Early Wynn in 1957 , and Yovani Gallardo , who did it in 2009 . Ruffing won 18 games during the 1932 season . He had a 3.09 ERA , second in the AL only to Lefty Grove 's 2.84 . Ruffing had 190 strikeouts , which led the AL . The Yankees won their first pennant since 1928 . Ruffing won his first World Series game during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs . He started Game One , and the Yankees swept the Cubs four games to zero . Ruffing had a 9 \u2013 14 win-loss record with a 3.91 ERA in the 1933 season , as the Yankees finished in second place in the AL . He threw a one-hitter on June 20 , 1934 , against the Cleveland Indians . Two weeks later , Joe Cronin selected Ruffing for the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game . At that point , he had a 9 \u2013 3 win-loss record on the season . He finished the season with a 19 \u2013 11 win-loss record , as the Yankees finished second in the AL . Ruffing pitched to a 16 \u2013 11 record in the 1935 season , as the Yankees again finished second in the AL . His 3.12 ERA was third in the league , behind only Grove and Ted Lyons . Ruffing won 20 games during the 1936 season . His 3.85 ERA was the sixth-best in the league , and his 20 wins tied him for third place , with Johnny Allen and Wes Ferrell , behind Tommy Bridges and Vern Kennedy . He started Game One of the 1936 World Series against the New York Giants , but lost . The Yankees defeated the Giants four games to two . In a salary dispute with the Yankees , Ruffing did not report to spring training , and he held out at the start of the 1937 season , missing the first month . He signed in May , receiving a $ 15,000 salary ( $ 246,910 in current dollar terms ) . Ruffing had a 20 \u2013 7 win-loss record for the Yankees in 1937 . He finished with the fourth-best ERA in the league , 2.98 , trailing Lefty Gomez , Monty Stratton , and Allen , and his 20 wins were second only to Gomez , who had 21 . His performance earned him eighth place in AL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award voting . He started Game Two in the 1937 World Series , earning the victory , as the Yankees defeated the Giants four games to one . The Yankees started Ruffing on Opening Day for the 1938 season . He was again named an All-Star during the 1938 season . Yankees ' manager Joe McCarthy , who managed the AL team in the All-Star Game , chose teammate Lefty Gomez as the starting pitcher . As McCarthy did not believe in pitching two players from the same team in an All-Star Game , Ruffing did not appear in the game . He led the AL with 21 wins in the 1938 season . He also tied for the AL lead in shutouts during with three , while his 3.31 ERA was third-best in the league , behind only Grove . Ruffing pitched the opening game of the 1938 World Series against the Cubs . He won two games in the series as the Yankees defeated the Cubs . Ruffing finished fourth in AL MVP voting for the 1938 season . = = = = = 1939 \u2013 46 = = = = = McCarthy named Ruffing to be the starting pitcher for the Yankees on Opening Day in 1939 . McCarthy , managing the AL All-Star team that year , also selected Ruffing as his starter for the 1939 MLB All-Star Game . He missed several weeks late in the 1939 season due to an arm injury , but managed to start Game One of the 1939 World Series . He defeated the Cincinnati Redlegs in that game , and the Yankees won the series in a four games to zero sweep . Ruffing won 21 games during the 1939 season . His four shutouts in the 1939 season again tied him for the AL lead , while he finished second in wins behind Bob Feller , and fourth in ERA ( 2.93 ) behind Grove , Lyons , and Feller . He finished fifth in the balloting for the AL MVP . Ruffing was the Yankees ' Opening Day starting pitcher in 1940 . He was named to the 1940 All-Star team , and Cronin , acting as manager , selected Ruffing as his starting pitcher . Ruffing finished the season with a 15 \u2013 12 win-loss record . Ruffing was a member of the 1941 All-Star team as well , but he did not pitch in the game . He had a 15 \u2013 6 win-loss record during the 1941 season , and was named the starting pitcher for Game One of the 1941 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers . Ruffing defeated the Dodgers , as the Yankees won the series four games to one . Ruffing pitched for the Yankees during Opening Day of the 1942 season . On the year , he compiled a 14 \u2013 7 win-loss record . He was again named an All-Star , and again did not pitch in the All-Star Game , which was started by teammate Spud Chandler . Though teammate Tiny Bonham had a better season , pitching to a 21 \u2013 5 win-loss record , McCarthy again chose Ruffing as his Game One starter for the 1942 World Series , setting a record with six World Series Game One starts that stood until Whitey Ford started his seventh Game One in the 1963 World Series . Ruffing defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in Game One , his seventh World Series victory . This set a record that was surpassed by Ford in 1960 . Ruffing pitched again in the Game Five , with the Yankees down three games to one . Ruffing lost the game , as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees to win the series . After the 1942 season , Ruffing took a job with Vultee Aircraft , a defense contractor . Despite his age ( 37 ) and missing toes , a United States Army doctor certified Ruffing as Class 1-B in the Selective Service System , overruled Ruffing 's personal physician , who had ruled Ruffing unfit for service . The Army decided that Ruffing could serve in a non-combat role . Ruffing missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons due to his service during World War II . He served in the Sixth Ferrying Group of the Air Transport Command of the United States Army Air Forces at the rank of private . However , he did pitch for the Air Transport Command 's baseball team , throwing a perfect game against Joe DiMaggio 's team , and leading his team to the championship against Ted Lyons ' team . In 1944 , he played with an All-Star team for troops stationed in Hawaii . Ruffing turned forty years of age during the war , resulting in his discharge in June 1945 . He rejoined the Yankees that month , signing for the same $ 20,000 salary ( $ 262,884 in current dollar terms ) he earned in 1942 . He made his first appearance with the Yankees since the 1942 season in July 1945 . Pitching for the Yankees as a spot starter in 1946 , he had a 5 \u2013 1 win-loss record and a 1.77 ERA when he suffered a broken kneecap from a line drive hit by Hank Majeski , and missed the remainder of the season . In total , Ruffing won 231 games with the Yankees . This mark was the most in franchise history , until Ford surpassed it in 1965 . He remains the winningest right-handed pitcher in Yankees ' history . = = = = Chicago White Sox ( 1947 ) = = = = Suffering from recurrent knee injuries , the Yankees released Ruffing after the 1946 season . He signed with the Chicago White Sox for the 1947 season , but continued to be limited by his knee . In May , the White Sox removed Ruffing from their active roster after he was hit in his bad knee with another line drive . He rejoined the White Sox ' active roster in July . He pitched to a 3 \u2013 5 win \u2013 loss record and a 6.11 ERA in nine games pitched on the season . Ruffing retired after the 1947 season . = = = = Career summary = = = = Ruffing finished his career with 273 wins , 225 losses , 1,987 strikeouts and a 3.80 ERA . He also had 16 saves . Ruffing compiled 335 complete games in his 536 games started . Ruffing could also handle the bat very well compared to most other pitchers , hitting 36 home runs and batting .269 in 1,937 career at-bats . He hit over .300 in eight different seasons , and was frequently used as a pinch hitter in games he did not pitch . He also played in the outfield in emergency situations . Ruffing 's home run total as a pitcher trails only Ferrell , Warren Spahn , and Bob Lemon . Ruffing holds the AL record for most runs and earned runs allowed . Ruffing threw a fastball , a \" sharp \" curveball , and a slider . According to AL umpire Bill Summers , \" [ O ] n account of Red Ruffing , the slider got to be the thing . \" Joe Paparella , also an AL umpire , said \" The first game I ever worked behind the plate in the major leagues was against the guy who invented the slider and had the best slider ever seen \u2014 Red Ruffing \" . = = Coaching career = = After he retired from pitching , Ruffing stayed with the White Sox organization to instruct their players . The White Sox named Ruffing the manager of their Class A minor league affiliate , the Muskegon Clippers of the Central League , for the 1949 season . That season , the Clippers finished in fifth place out of six teams . In 1950 , Ruffing managed the Daytona Beach Islanders of the Florida State League , a Cleveland Indians ' affiliate . When Al Simmons retired from his coaching position with the Indians just before the 1951 season due to his failing health , bullpen coach Jake Flowers was moved to the third base coaching position , and Ruffing took over Flowers 's duties . From 1952 through 1961 , Ruffing was a player personnel executive for the Indians . Ruffing returned to the baseball field serving as pitching coach for the expansion New York Mets in 1962 , which were run by George Weiss , the general manager , and Casey Stengel , the manager . Weiss and Stengel had held the same positions with the Yankees during Ruffing 's tenure . As a team , the Mets had a 5.04 ERA across the 1962 season , which was the worst in the major leagues . The job also involved scouting duties , which Ruffing did not like , and he retired shortly after the season ended . He returned to baseball again for the 1969 season , at the request of former teammate Don Heffner , who was managing the Denver Bears of the American Association . Ruffing served as Heffner 's pitching coach . = = Personal = = Ruffing married Pauline Mulholland , a native of Chicago , at the end of the 1934 season . The couple settled in Long Beach , California . When he worked for the Indians in the 1950s , the Ruffing family relocated to Cleveland . The couple had a son , named Charles , Jr . Ruffing suffered a stroke in 1974 , at the age of 68 , which left him paralyzed on his left side . As a result , he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life . This was Ruffing 's second stroke , and he also suffered from kidney and heart problems . He contracted skin cancer , necessitating the partial amputation of one of his ears . He died on February 17 , 1986 , at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights , Ohio , of heart failure . = = Honors = = In balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame following his retirement , Ruffing often received votes from approximately 50 % of the voters in the Baseball Writers ' Association of America , short of the 75 % required for induction . Bob Feller wrote an article in The Saturday Evening Post in 1962 , calling Ruffing , Satchel Paige , and Luke Appling the three most deserving players who had yet to be elected . The balloting of 1967 was Ruffing 's final year of eligibility , as he had retired twenty years prior . Ruffing finished with 212 votes , tied with Joe Medwick for the highest vote count , but was seven votes short of the 219 required for induction . However , a runoff election held the next month saw Ruffing into the Hall of Fame the next month . During an Old-Timers ' Day ceremony held on July 10 , 2004 at Yankee Stadium , the Yankees dedicated a plaque in Ruffing 's memory . The plaque is displayed in Monument Park . ESPN.com ranked Ruffing as the ninth greatest Yankee of all time . A museum in Nokomis , Illinois , the Bottomley-Ruffing-Schalk Museum , is dedicated to Ruffing and fellow Hall of Famers Ray Schalk and Jim Bottomley ."

                    "text": "Aaron Loup = Aaron Christopher Loup ( born December 19 , 1987 ) is an American professional baseball relief pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball . He stands 6 feet 0 inches ( 183 cm ) and weighs 210 pounds ( 95 kg ) . Born in Raceland , Louisiana , Loup played baseball at Hahnville High School and Tulane University , where he led his teams to several state playoff appearances and recorded a five-hit shutout . He was drafted by the Blue Jays out of Tulane in the ninth round of the 2009 draft . After playing for three years with minor-league affiliates for the Toronto Blue Jays and even being chosen for the 2012 Eastern League All-Star Game , Loup was called up to the Blue Jays as a replacement for Luis P\u00e9rez and retired all six batters he faced . He was later voted the 2012 Toronto Blue Jays Rookie of the Year by the Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America ( BBWAA ) . Loup pitched 11 \u2044 3 innings on Opening Day in 2013 , and would go on to win his first major league game on April 10 against the Detroit Tigers . He recorded his first two major league saves on April 12 and June 2 , and led the Blue Jays to a win in an 18-inning game on June 8 after a pair of groundouts . Loup is a southpaw whose pitching drastically improved after coaches told him to become a sidearm pitcher . His fastball has been noted as particularly effective against both left- and right-handed batters , but he continues to struggle with a changeup . Manager John Gibbons does not view Loup as a long reliever , but rather as a \" situational , one-inning guy . \" He is known for his \" relaxed \" personality , which has improved after spending time with his teammates . = = Early life = = Loup was born December 19 , 1987 , in Raceland , Louisiana . His father and grandfather influenced his baseball interest the most when he was young , and he says that it was \" just all baseball all the time \" , with \" a little football \" . Loup said that when he was thirteen , \" My dad had me in the backyard almost every day \u2014 or at least it seemed that way . I was always doing something , whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage . I wanted to play baseball and knew that I needed to work hard to get there . As a kid , I needed to be reminded of that sometimes . \" His baseball role models growing up were Greg Maddux , John Smoltz , and Tom Glavine . Loup played baseball at Hahnville High School , where he led the Hahnville Fighting Tigers to four state playoff appearances . As a sophomore , he threw a complete-game no-hitter against Terrebonne High School . He then attended Tulane University , where he majored in digital design and played for the Tulane Green Wave from freshman year until his junior year , when he was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays . As a freshman for the Green Wave , he held a 4.37 earned run average ( ERA ) and 36 strikeouts in 35 innings . As a sophomore , he held a 5.66 ERA in 472 \u2044 3 innings , as well as pitching a perfect game of relief on April 26 , 2008 . Before being drafted in his junior year , he had thrown 571 \u2044 3 innings . = = Professional career = = = = = Draft = = = The Blue Jays drafted Loup in the ninth round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft . Loup had shown a strong performance when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted . Loup said of the event , \" I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my phone rang and I got the call . It 's exciting . They told me they would call me as soon as the draft was over and we would discuss details , so hopefully everything will shake out . \" = = = Minor league career = = = After the draft , Loup played for the Gulf Coast League Blue Jays in 2009 . In the 2009 season , he held a 3.86 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 161 \u2044 3 innings . In 2010 , he was moved up to the Lansing Lugnuts , one of the Class A affiliates of the Blue Jays , where he held a 4.54 ERA and 73 strikeouts in 731 \u2044 3 innings . On June 22 , 2010 , Loup was chosen a Mid-Season All-Star . He missed the last two months of the season with an unknown injury and began 2011 on the disabled list . In 2011 , he was moved to the Dunedin Blue Jays , the Class A-Advanced Blue Jays affiliate , where he held a 4.66 ERA and 56 strikeouts in 652 \u2044 3 innings . In 2012 , Loup joined the New Hampshire Fisher Cats , the double-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays . There , he boasted 36 Eastern League appearances , a 2.84 ERA , and 43 strikeouts in 441 \u2044 3 innings . After his teammate Sam Dyson was promoted to the Blue Jays , Loup was Dyson 's replacement for the Minor League Baseball 2012 Eastern League All-Star Game . = = = Toronto Blue Jays = = = = = = = 2012 = = = = Loup began 2012 with the Fisher Cats . In the 2012 season , the Toronto Blue Jays used 32 different pitchers due to frequent injuries , and Loup was among these . He was called up to replace Luis P\u00e9rez on July 14 after P\u00e9rez tore his ulnar collateral ligament . In his debut , Loup retired all six batters he faced . On August 3 , Loup became the first pitcher in Blue Jays history to bat in an American League game , grounding out to begin the top of the 15th against the Oakland Athletics . Loup closed out the season posting a 0-2 record with a 2.64 ERA and 21 strikeouts in 302 \u2044 3 innings . The Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America ( BBWAA ) named him the Toronto Blue Jays 2012 Rookie of the Year that November . = = = = 2013 = = = = Though he was considered one of the front-runners , there was still much competition for one of the limited 2013 bullpen spots as a relief pitcher . His main competition was seen as Brett Cecil and J. A. Happ . John Gibbons said , \" How it best fits the team , how it all stacks up down there is really what it 's going to come down to . But we 're going to go with the best guy , not because guys are out of options . \" Reportedly , Loup learned that he had acquired one of the bullpen spots when Gibbons walked by his locker and said , \" Oh , hey Loup \u2014 you made the team . \" Loup pitched 1 1 \u2044 3 innings of relief for the Blue Jays against the Cleveland Indians on Opening Day . On April 10 , in a game against the Detroit Tigers , Loup recorded his first career win . On April 12 , Loup recorded his first major league save in a game against the Kansas City Royals . He would later record a second major league save in a game against the San Diego Padres on June 2 . On April 20 , Loup committed a two-run throwing error in the eleventh inning against the New York Yankees . During the first two months of the Blue Jays ' lackluster 2013 season , Loup and other relief pitchers helped to keep the Blue Jays from more defeats . Loup was the ninth and final pitcher in an eighteen-inning game against the Texas Rangers on June 8 . The game , which was the longest in Blue Jays history , resulted in a win after Loup gained a pair of groundouts . In another game against the Rangers on June 14 , Loup pitched in the eighth inning and participated in a shutout . Loup ended the 2013 season with a 4 \u2013 6 record , 2.47 ERA and 53 strikeouts in 691 \u2044 3 innings . = = = = 2014 = = = = Loup was one of eight pitchers in the bullpen for the Blue Jays ' 2014 opening day . On April 20 , Loup walked three consecutive batters for the first time in his career , and took the loss as the Blue Jays fell to the Cleveland Indians 6 \u2013 4 . On May 3 , the Blue Jays announced that Loup would replace Sergio Santos as the team 's closer until Casey Janssen returned from injury . After walking as many batters in three months as he had the entire last season , Loup regained confidence after pitching the last few innings of a game on June 4 that went from a 3 \u2013 2 lead to an 8 \u2013 2 win against the Detroit Tigers . = = = = 2015 = = = = Loup took the loss in the Blue Jays ' second game of the 2015 season .

All three runners would come in to score and Toronto would lose , 4 \u2013 3 . On April 12 , Loup pitched 12 \u2044 3 perfect innings against the Orioles , taking the win by a score of 10 \u2013 7 . Loup experienced ineffectiveness throughout the season , posting an ERA over 5.00 into August . Following a 3 \u2013 1 win over the Yankees on August 16 , Loup was optioned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons . He was recalled on September 1 . = = = = 2016 = = = = On January 15 , 2016 , Loup and the Blue Jays avoided salary arbitration by agreeing to a one-year , $ 1.05 million contract . Loup began the 2016 season on the disabled list with a left forearm flexor strain . He began a rehab assignment with the Dunedin Blue Jays on May 14 . On May 21 , he was moved up to the Buffalo Bisons to continue rehabbing the injury . = = = Scouting report = = = = = = = Defense = = = = Due to his non-ideal size as a pitcher , some have seen issues in Loup 's stamina and durability . His pitches can also come across as \" a bit too hittable . \" He is , however , especially effective when pitching against left-handed batters . In 2013 , Loup was viewed by the Blue Jays ' manager John Gibbons as \" not necessarily a long guy ; he 's more a situational , one-inning guy . \" Despite his shortcomings , Loup has the lowest walk rate among all major league pitchers who have pitched at least seventy innings since 2012 , having walked only 2.6 % of the batters he has faced . His consistency and endurance have made Loup the Blue Jays ' most-used reliever , and he says \" I 'm one of those guys that if my body would let me , I would pitch every day . \" The Baseball Cube 's player ratings , which are based solely on statistics on a scale from 0-100 , gave Loup a 69 for control , a 62 for \" K-rating \" , or strikeouts compared to batters faced , a 62 for efficiency , and a 52 for \" vsPower \" , or home runs compared to batters faced . = = = = Pitching style = = = = Loup is a left-handed pitcher , or southpaw . He struggled at first with pitching until minor league pitching instructor Dane Johnson and Dunedin pitching coach Darold Knowles told him to lower his arm and become more of a sidearm pitcher . Now , as he pitches , he tracks a plane from his ear to his shoulder , which also helped his effectiveness against left-handed batters . His slider and fastball improved drastically , but his changeup continued to struggle , and Loup says that he is still a little inconsistent with it . He can throw a low-90s \" breaking \" fastball that is just as effective against right-handed batters as left-handed batters . John Farrell , a previous Toronto Blue Jays manager , said that it was \" [ Loup 's ] poise and his presence that allows him to maintain not only composure , but the ability to execute . \" Blue Jays ' bullpen coach Pat Hentgen says that Loup \" keeps things simple , he doesn 't over-think . He stays aggressive . He 's got a lot of guts , goes right after hitters and you combine all those things and you 're going to have the success that he 's had . \" One reporter compared Loup to Bran Flakes , stating that \" [ y ] ou know exactly what you 're going to get from him every time he takes the mound and he 's not going to add any excitement to any situation . \" = = Personal life = = Loup married his high school sweetheart Leigh Ann . The couple have one child , a daughter named Sophie Harper Loup , born the weekend of August 24 , 2013 . Loup went on the paternity list for the Blue Jays on August 23 , 2013 , but was called back on August 26 due to the three-day paternity list limit . Loup and his wife spend the off-season at Loup 's Louisiana home . An avid bowhunter , Loup prefers hunting deer with a compound bow . He has also been known to fish and hunt with a gun in the off-season . He is known for having a more quiet and reserved personality , but he says that he has become \" a little more comfortable \" with his teammates by spending time and \" connecting \" with them , which he says contributes to his success .",

                    "text": "Baa , Baa , Black Sheep = \" Baa , Baa , Black Sheep \" is an English nursery rhyme , the earliest surviving version of which dates from 1731 . The words have changed little in two and a half centuries . It is sung to a variant of the 1761 French melody Ah ! vous dirai-je , maman . Uncorroborated theories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme . These include that it is a complaint against Medieval English taxes on wool and that it is about the slave trade . In the twentieth century it was a subject of controversies in debates about political correctness . It has been used in literature and popular culture as a metaphor and allusion . The Roud Folk Song Index classifies the lyrics and their variations as number 4439 . = = Modern version = = Recent versions tend to take the following form : The rhyme is a single stanza in trochaic metre , which is common in nursery rhymes and relatively easy for younger children to master . The Roud Folk Song Index , which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number , classifies the song as 4439 and variations have been collected across Great Britain and North America . = = Original version = = This rhyme was first printed in Tommy Thumb 's Pretty Song Book , the oldest surviving collection of English language nursery rhymes , published c . 1744 with the lyrics very similar to those still used today : In the next surviving printing , in Mother Goose 's Melody ( c . 1765 ) , the rhyme remained the same , except the last lines , which were given as , \" But none for the little boy who cries in the lane \" . = = Melody = = The rhyme is usually sung to a variant of the 1761 French melody Ah ! vous dirai-je , maman , which is also used for \" Twinkle Twinkle Little Star \" and the \" Alphabet song \" . The words and melody were first published together by A. H. Rosewig in ( Illustrated National ) Nursery Songs and Games , published in Philadelphia in 1879 . = = Origins and meaning = = As with many nursery rhymes , attempts have been made to find origins and meanings for the rhyme , most which have no corroborating evidence . Katherine Elwes Thomas in The Real Personages of Mother Goose ( 1930 ) suggested that the rhyme referred to resentment at the heavy taxation on wool . This has particularly been taken to refer to the medieval English \" Great \" or \" Old Custom \" wool tax of 1275 , which survived until the fifteenth century . More recently the rhyme has been connected to the slave trade , particularly in the southern United States . This explanation was advanced during debates over political correctness and the use and reform of nursery rhymes in the 1980s , but has no supporting historical evidence . Rather than being negative , the wool of black sheep may have been prized as it could be made into dark cloth without dyeing . = = Modern controversies = = A controversy emerged over changing the language of \" Baa Baa Black Sheep \" in Britain from 1986 , because , it was alleged in the popular press , it was seen as racially dubious . This was based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery as an exercise for the children there and not on any local government policy . A similar controversy emerged in 1999 when reservations about the rhyme were submitted to Birmingham City Council by a working group on racism in children 's resources , which were never approved or implemented . Two private nurseries in Oxfordshire in 2006 altered the song to \" Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep \" , with black being replaced with a variety of other adjectives , like \" happy , sad , hopping \" and \" pink \" . In 2012 , a private nursery in Kingston upon Thames replaced \" black \" with \" little \" for their Easter show . Commentators have asserted that these controversies have been exaggerated or distorted by some elements of the press as part of a more general campaign against political correctness . In 2014 , there was controversy in the Australian state of Victoria , where some kindergartens changed the words \" black sheep , \" because of concerns over the racial connotations of the word \" black . \u201d In addition , they were considering changing the line \" one for the little boy who lives down the lane , \" in case it could be deemed sexist . = = Allusions = = The phrase \" yes sir , yes sir , three bags full sir \" has been used to describe any obsequious or craven subordinate . It is attested from 1910 , and originally was common in the British Royal Navy . The rhyme has often been raised in literature and popular culture . Rudyard Kipling used the rhyme as the title of a semi-autobiographical short story he wrote in 1888 . The name Black Sheep Squadron was used for the Marine Attack Squadron 214 of the United States Marine Corps from 1942 and the title Baa Baa Black Sheep was used for a book by its leader Colonel Gregory \" Pappy \" Boyington and for a TV series ( later syndicated as Black Sheep Squadron ) that aired on NBC from 1976 until 1978 . In 1951 , together with \" In the Mood \" , \" Baa Baa Black Sheep \" was the first song ever to be digitally saved and played on a computer .",

                    "text": "Bob Lemon = Robert Granville \" Bob \" Lemon ( September 22 , 1920 \u2013 January 11 , 2000 ) was an American right-handed pitcher and manager in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . Lemon was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a player in 1976 . Lemon was raised in California where he played high school baseball and was the state player of the year in 1938 . At the age of 17 , Lemon began his professional baseball career in the Cleveland Indians organization , with whom he played for his entire professional career . Lemon was called up to Cleveland 's major league team as a utility player in 1941 . He then joined the United States Navy during World War II and returned to the Indians in 1946 . That season was the first Lemon would play at the pitcher position . The Indians played in the 1948 World Series and were helped by Lemon 's two pitching wins as they won the club 's first championship since 1920 . In the early 1950s , Cleveland had a starting pitching rotation which included Lemon , Bob Feller , Mike Garcia and Early Wynn . During the 1954 season , Lemon had a career-best 23 \u2013 7 win \u2013 loss record and the Indians set a 154-game season AL-record win mark when they won 111 games before they won the American League ( AL ) pennant . He was an All-Star for seven consecutive seasons and recorded seven seasons of 20 or more pitching wins in a nine-year period from 1948 \u2013 1956 . Lemon was a manager with the Kansas City Royals , Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees . He was named Manager of the Year with the White Sox and Yankees . In 1978 , he was fired as manager of the White Sox . He was named Yankees manager one month later and he led the team to a 1978 World Series title . Lemon became the first AL manager to win a World Series after assuming the managerial role in the middle of a season . = = Early life = = Bob Lemon was born in San Bernardino , California . Lemon 's father , Earl Lemon , ran an ice business and later moved the family to Long Beach , California . There , Lemon attended Wilson Classical High School and played shortstop on the school 's baseball team . He was recognized as the state baseball player of the year by the California Interscholastic Federation ( CIF ) Southern Section in 1938 . Later that same year , at the age of 17 , Lemon began his professional baseball career in the farm system of the Cleveland Indians as a member of the Oswego Netherlands of the Canadian \u2013 American League and later that year , the Middle Atlantic League 's Springfield Indians . In 75 games with the Netherlands he recorded a .312 batting average . The following season he played 80 games with Springfield , and hit .293 , and then joined the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association , where Lemon hit .309 . He spent the next two seasons at the Class A level with the Eastern League 's Wilkes-Barre Barons as he hit .255 in 1940 and .301 in 1941 . In his final stint in the minors , Lemon hit .268 with 21 home runs for the 1942 Baltimore Orioles of the International League . = = Major League career = = = = = Making it as a utility player = = = Lemon 's major league debut came as a third baseman as a late season call-up on September 9 , 1941 . He appeared in five games and collected one hit in five plate appearances . He was joined by catcher and fellow rookie Jim Hegan . He repeated the same number of games in the 1942 season and failed to record a hit . Lemon served in the United States Navy during World War II and missed the next three seasons . Before leaving for tour duty in 1943 , Lemon married Jane McGee . Lemon was the Indians ' center fielder for Opening Day in 1946 . On April 30 , Indians pitcher Bob Feller no-hit the New York Yankees ; Feller later wrote that Lemon 's \" daring catch \" and \" throwing to and doubling a man off second base \" were key in \" saving my \" no-hitter . By season 's end , however , Lemon had entered more games as a pitcher than a utility player . Before that season , Lemon had only pitched one inning while with Oswego and another while with Wilkes-Barre . Birdie Tebbetts of the Detroit Tigers and Johnny Pesky of the Boston Red Sox had played against Lemon in Navy baseball games , and they spoke to Indians player-manager Lou Boudreau about switching Lemon from the outfield to the pitching mound . Boudreau discussed the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey , who had also played in the Navy with Lemon . \" I knew Lemon had a strong arm , and once I realized he was not going to hit with consistency as an outfielder , I thought it would be worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher \" , Boudreau later wrote . Lemon resisted the idea at first , but he agreed to the change after he learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher . Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position . Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider , a key pitch in his repertoire . That same year , Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon \" some day will become the best pitcher in the American League . \" Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record ( 4 \u2013 5 ) , the only one he would have until 1957 , and a career-low 2.49 ERA . He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11 \u2013 5 record . He appeared in 19 games before August , largely as a relief pitcher , but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox . During the last two months of the season , Lemon went 9 \u2013 3 and pitched six complete games , including two 11-inning outings . = = = Full-time pitcher to World Series champion = = = Before the 1948 season started , team president Bill Veeck doubled Lemon 's contract amount . It would be Lemon 's first full season as a pitcher . Lemon was the Indians ' number-two pitcher in the starting rotation , behind Bob Feller . On June 30 , 1948 , Lemon pitched a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers in a 2 \u2013 0 win , earning his 11th win and fifth shutout of the season . He became the ninth Indians pitcher to record a no-hitter and ended the season with an AL-best 20 complete games . His ten shutouts on the season were the most in the majors . Lemon would go on to win the 1948 AL Pitcher of the Year Award . With three games remaining in the regular season , 20-game winner Lemon started the first game of their final series against Detroit . Lemon allowed three runs on seven hits and the Indians lost the game . Cleveland lost two games of the three-game series , forcing a one-game playoff with the Boston Red Sox . Speculation built up around which Indians pitcher Boudreau would send to the mound against the Red Sox on October 4 ; the choices were largely narrowed down to Lemon and Satchel Paige . Lemon was listed as Cleveland 's \" probable pitcher \" by United Press International in morning newspapers the day of the game , even though he would be working on two days of rest . Instead , Boudreau went with Gene Bearden , who would be pitching on one day of rest , and the choice was solidified when veteran second baseman Joe Gordon spoke up in support of Boudreau at a team meeting . The Indians won the game at Fenway Park by a score of 8 \u2013 3 and prepared to face the Boston Braves in the World Series . Boudreau started Feller in game one , which Cleveland lost . Lemon was the starter in the second game . Lemon faced Warren Spahn , and Cleveland won 4 \u2013 1 . Lemon was named the starter for game six in Boston with the Indians leading the series 3 \u2013 2 . He allowed three earned runs on eight hits and Cleveland had the lead when Lemon was replaced by Bearden . The Braves scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth inning but the Indians won the game , 4 \u2013 3 , to clinch the franchise 's first World Series title since 1920 . Lemon was the only pitcher from either club to win two games in the Series . He finished the Series with a 1.65 ERA . Lemon 's hitting skills began to get attention as well . By August 1949 , Lemon was batting .295 with 11 extra-base hits and six home runs , prompting Yankees manager Casey Stengel to comment , \" Well , I see where the Indians have nine hitters in the lineup instead of eight . \" Columnist Milton Richman wrote , \" Lemon 's fine work at the plate has also conspired to tire him more . When the Indians get behind and Lemon is pitching , he rarely is yanked for a pinch hitter in the early innings . It 's a tough price he 's paying for batting fame . \" In 1950 , Lemon led the major leagues in pitching wins ( 23 ) for the first time and he would win his second AL Pitcher of the Year Award . He pitched a six-hit complete game over the Detroit Tigers in his last start of the season on September 29 . When Lemon signed a new contract before the 1951 season , the Indians made him the highest paid pitcher in baseball . At the beginning of the 1951 season , columnist Oscar Fraley pointed out that Lemon was one of only 12 active pitchers who had earned a winning record in four consecutive seasons . He finished the season with a 3.52 ERA , lower than the 1950 season mark of 3.84 when he led the majors with 23 wins , and a 17 \u2013 14 record . The loss total was the most in the AL . He did not record his first shutout of the season until well into August , when he earned a three-hit win over the Chicago White Sox . Upon completion of the 1952 season , Lemon recorded the second-lowest ERA of his career , 2.50 , and went 22 \u2013 11 . His 28 complete games were a career-high and led the AL . He joined teammates Early Wynn ( 23 ) and Mike Garcia ( 22 ) as part of a Cleveland starting rotation which featured three 20-game winners . On Opening Day of the 1953 season , Lemon pitched a one-hitter against the Chicago White Sox and earned a win . He finished the season with a 21 \u2013 15 record , 3.36 ERA and led the AL in innings pitched for the fourth and final time of his career . = = = Second World Series appearance = = = In 1954 he was 23 \u2013 7 and won his third AL Pitcher of the Year Award as Cleveland won the pennant . The Indians set an AL record with 111 wins . ( The record stood until major league seasons were lengthened to 162 games , and it has been surpassed twice since then . ) Lemon was named Cleveland 's starter for game one of the 1954 World Series . After nine innings , the Indians and Giants were tied 2 \u2013 2 . Lemon stayed in the game to pitch the tenth and final inning , but he surrendered a three-run home run to pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes and the Indians lost , 5 \u2013 2 . Indians manager Al L\u00f3pez went with Lemon again in the fourth game after only two days rest . \" He hasn 't worked that close together all year because we had a good bunch of other pitchers , but a year ago , he and Wynn and Garcia pitched every third day for practically a month . Bob will be all right \" , Lopez said . Lemon and the Indians lost the game , 7 \u2013 4 , as the Giants swept the Series four games to none . In his two appearances , he went 0 \u2013 2 with a 6.75 ERA , allowed eight walks and recorded 11 strikeouts . Lemon began the 1955 season with a 5 \u2013 0 record in April , but he was the only Cleveland starting pitcher with a winning record that month . His 18 wins tied for the most in the AL that year . He recorded five complete games through May 30 but none after that date . Indians general manager Hank Greenberg got Lemon to agree to his first reduction in contract salary since joining the organization . Lemon earned his 200th career win against the Baltimore Orioles on September 11 , 1956 , and he also hit a home run that day . He finished the season with a 20 \u2013 14 record , the last of his seven career 20-win seasons , and led the AL in complete games ( 21 ) . On August 13 , 1957 , it was announced that Lemon would not finish the season due to continued irritation to his elbow after bone chips were found earlier in the season . Lemon ended the season with a record of 6 \u2013 11 , his first losing record since 1946 . In 1958 , Lemon was the oldest Indian on the roster at age 37 . Lemon pitched 3.1 innings over the span of two games before he was put on the Indians ' disabled list and sent to the Triple-A San Diego Padres . There he continued physical conditioning and mentored the pitching staff of the Indians ' top farm club . He appeared in 12 games with the Padres , going 2 \u2013 5 , with a 4.34 ERA , 22 walks , and 19 strikeouts . He returned to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role , but he appeared in only nine games that season . He earned just one decision that year , a loss , which brought his career pitching record to 207 \u2013 128 . The club put him on waivers in July . = = = Retirement = = = At 38 , Lemon went to Tucson in 1959 to attend Indians ' spring training camp . He told manager Joe Gordon that he was willing to become a relief pitcher , but he retired as a player on March 5 , stating , \" I just couldn 't keep up with the young fellows anymore . \" He accepted a scouting role with the Indians . Lemon retired in 1958 with 207 wins , all but ten of them occurring in a ten-year span . He recorded 274 hits in 1,1883 at-bats ( .232 ) , and his 37 career home runs are second on the all-time career list for pitchers ( behind Wes Ferrell 's 38 ) . In 1951 , Ted Williams had written of Lemon : \" I have to rate Lemon as one of the very best pitchers I ever faced . His ball was always moving , hard , sinking , fast-breaking . You could never really uhmmmph with Lemon \" . The Indians organization retired Lemon 's jersey number , 21 , in 1998 , making him the sixth Indian to receive the honor . On January 22 , 1976 , Lemon was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America on the twelfth ballot on which he appeared . He received 75 percent of the vote . On August 8 , one day before his induction ceremony , Lemon said , \" It 's a great thrill . My mother is 83 but she is making the trip from California . She says she can die happy now that I 've been elected to the Hall of Fame . \" Lemon 's dominant slider has been cited as a key reason for his election to the Hall of Fame . = = Post-playing career = = = = = Coaching = = = In 1959 , Lemon became a scout for Cleveland . The next season he became a coach with the Indians . In 1961 , he joined the Philadelphia Phillies coaching staff . The California Angels hired him as their pitching coach for 1967 \u2013 1968 . In 1976 , Lemon served as pitching coach for the AL champion New York Yankees . The Yankees were owned by Cleveland-area native George Steinbrenner and they had been the chief antagonists of the Cleveland Indians during Lemon 's pitching years . In recognition of his election to the Hall of Fame , Lemon was named honorary captain of the AL team for the All-Star Game . = = = Managing = = = Lemon 's first managerial role came with the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders of the PCL . His next appointment was in the same league with the Seattle Angels , where he managed from 1965 \u2013 1966 and won the 1966 championship . He was named the PCL 's Manager of the Year by The Sporting News for the 1966 season . He returned to the PCL as the manager for the Vancouver Mounties for one season in 1969 . Lemon said he used Indians manager Al L\u00f3pez as a model for his managing style : \" Lopez always handled his players like I 'd want to be handled . He treated men like men . He made them feel relaxed . That 's the only way to play this game ... by being relaxed . You can 't be worried about the manager getting on you . All the time I was at Cleveland , I saw Lopez get mad only twice . He never showed anybody up . I don 't do it either . \" = = = = Kansas City Royals = = = = Lemon became pitching coach of the Royals for the 1970 season , and got his first major league managing position when the Kansas City fired manager Charlie Metro on June 7 , 1970 . By August , Lemon received a one-year contract extension with the club : \" I know many major league owners are against hiring a former pitcher as manager and I 've always wondered why . Pitching is 75 per cent of the game . If it 's so important , why not have a former pitcher as manager ? He can always have someone else run the other 25 per cent of the club . \" In 1971 , Lemon guided the Royals to their first winning season since the franchise began as an expansion team in 1969 . Lemon finished second in the Associated Press AL Manager of the Year voting . Before the 1972 season , Lemon talked about the team 's chances , saying \" Five clubs could win it , including ourselves . \" However , the Royals finished 76 \u2013 78 in Lemon 's last year with the club . Royals owner Ewing Kauffman fired Lemon as manager and stated that he wanted a younger person to fill the position and \" did not want to lose Jack McKeon \" , who was named as Lemon 's replacement . Royals outfielder Lou Piniella was one of several players who disagreed with Kauffman 's decision , saying , \" ... Lemon deserved to manage the club next year . \" His third and final stint in the PCL was with the Sacramento Solons in 1974 . His last minor league managerial position came the following season with the International League 's Richmond Braves . = = = = Chicago White Sox = = = = Bill Veeck hired Lemon to succeed Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16 , 1976 . Lemon took over a Chicago team that finished in last place in the AL West in 1976 . \" Bob is the type of manager we need at this stage of the game \" , Veeck said . During spring training of 1977 , Lemon said , \" I think we 'll surprise a few people . \" White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference . Comparing Richards to Lemon , Bannister said , \" He 'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game , and only then we 'd find out who was playing and where . Lemon 's made it a serious operation . \" As late as August 14 , the White Sox were in first place in the AL West . The White Sox finished with a 90 \u2013 72 record , a 26-game improvement . The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award . \" The fans got behind us after about three weeks . They had a lot to do with our success \" , Lemon said after being winning the award . Lemon was fired the following season on June 30 , 1978 , by Veeck after Chicago posted a 34 \u2013 40 record in the first half of the 1978 season . He was replaced by former Indians ' teammate Larry Doby . \" This change is not meant as any commentary on Lemon 's ability but rather was the result of unusual circumstances which seemed to make a change necessary \" , said Veeck . = = = = New York Yankees = = = = Yankees manager Billy Martin resigned on July 24 , 1978 , and team president Al Rosen called Lemon to offer him the vacant position . He was announced as the new manager the next day . At their 1978 Old Timers Day five days after the Martin \u2013 Lemon changeover , the Yankees divulged that Lemon would be moved in 1980 to general manager , and they said that Martin would then return as field manager . The announcement was made by public-address announcer Bob Sheppard after the Old Timers had been announced and it was accompanied by Martin 's dramatic entrance from the Yankee dugout . Martin received a long standing ovation from fans . Lemon responded to his new job \u2014 and to the newspaper strike that helped calm down the atmosphere in the Yankees clubhouse \u2014 by guiding the Yankees to the 1978 pennant . The Yankees , who trailed the Red Sox by 14 games at one point in July , pulled even with the Red Sox by defeating them in a four-game September series known as the \" Boston Massacre . \" The Yankees pulled ahead by three and a half games , but the Red Sox rallied to tie the Yanks by the final day of the season . A one-game playoff would determine the AL Eastern Division winner . Ron Guidry was named the Yankees ' starting pitcher for the October 2 playoff game at Fenway Park . Guidry was able to pitch \" because of Lemon 's good planning . \" The Yankees defeated Boston for the division title in the tie-breaker game , punctuated both by a dramatic three-run home run by Bucky Dent in the seventh inning , and an eighth-inning homer by Reggie Jackson that proved the game 's winning run . Lemon became the third manager in MLB history to replace another mid-season and win the pennant . Lemon 's Yankees then beat the Royals in the ALCS and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the World Series title . With the Series win , Lemon became the first AL manager and third MLB manager to take over a team mid-season and win a World Series . Before the World Series , one columnist wrote , \" ... many observers feel that Lemon 's low-keyed approach with the Yankees ' temperamental millionaires as compared to the combativeness of Martin served to mold a spirit of togetherness among the Yankees that did not even exist last year when they won it all . \" Lemon and his handling of the season was described in The New York Times as \" an island of calm in a stormy summer . \" Changes Lemon made during the season included returning Thurman Munson to the team 's every day catcher ( he had been playing in the outfield ) , putting Jackson in the clean-up spot in the batting order and becoming the regular right fielder , and pitching Ed Figueroa every fourth day ( instead of fifth ) . In October , Lemon was named the Associated Press ' AL Manager of the Year , the second time he received such an award . Lemon 's 26-year-old son , Jerry , was killed in an automobile accident in the fall of 1978 , 10 days after Lemon won the World Series . The following season with the Yankees at 34 \u2013 31 , Lemon was fired in June by Steinbrenner and replaced by Martin , but he remained with the organization as he had a contract through the 1982 season . Speaking of Martin , Lemon said , \" He 's a very likeable guy , a free spirit . Where maybe I keep things inside , he lets them come out . There 's nothing wrong with that . \" The Yankees finished in fourth place in the AL East ( 89 \u2013 71 ) . Lemon worked as a scout for the Yankees and received \" several offers \" from other teams to serve as manager . One offer came in 1979 from the Indians , but Lemon refused it as well as the others . = = = = Second stint with Yankees = = = = Steinbrenner named Lemon the team 's field manager a second time on September 6 , 1981 , the sixth Yankees ' manager change since 1978 . Lemon moved on to the post-season and dispatched the Milwaukee Brewers and the Billy Martin-led Oakland Athletics , and won the first two games of the 1981 World Series against the Dodgers , only to lose four straight and the Series . Lemon survived just a few weeks into the 1982 season ( the Yankees were 6 \u2013 8 ) before Steinbrenner dismissed him one last time , despite a promise for Steinbrenner he would manage the season \" no matter what . \" Of the agreement between Lemon and Steinbrenner , Steinbrenner said , \" Lem and I talked . He said it was O.K. He said he didn 't take it as a promise anyway . \" Gene Michael succeeded Lemon as manager .

He was a member of the NL pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas in 1899 and New York Giants in 1904 and 1905 . He was also a member of the 1905 World Series champions . After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball in 1895 , McGann played in MLB for the Boston Beaneaters ( 1896 ) , Baltimore Orioles ( 1898 ) , Brooklyn Superbas ( 1899 ) , Washington Senators ( 1899 ) , and St. Louis Cardinals ( 1900 \u2013 1901 ) of the National League ( NL ) before jumping to the rival American League to play for the Baltimore Orioles in 1902 . He returned to the NL , playing for the New York Giants ( 1902 \u2013 1907 ) and Boston Doves ( 1908 ) . In 1909 \u2013 10 , he played for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American Association . McGann had a troubled personal life . He suffered from depression , and several members of his family committed suicide . After the 1910 season , with rumors of McGann signing with another minor league team , McGann committed suicide with a firearm . = = Career = = = = = Early career ( 1891 \u2013 1897 ) = = = McGann began his professional baseball career in minor league baseball with a team representing his hometown , Shelbyville , Kentucky , in 1891 . He also played for Kentucky teams representing Harrodsburg in 1892 , Lexington in 1893 , and Maysville in 1894 . McGann played for the Norfolk Clams / Crows of the Class-B Virginia State League in 1895 and the Lynchburg Hill Climbers of the Class-B Virginia League in 1896 . He initially played all positions except for pitcher , catcher , and first baseman . In August 1896 , the Boston Beaneaters of the National League ( NL ) purchased McGann from Lynchburg to fill in for injured second baseman Bobby Lowe . McGann batted .322 with the Beaneaters , hitting for power , but he committed 21 errors in 43 games . The Beaneaters released him following the completion of the season . McGann played the 1897 season with the Toronto Canucks of the Class-A Eastern League . He moved to first base and batted .354 , leading the Eastern League with 20 triples . = = = Major League Baseball ( 1898 \u2013 1908 ) = = = The Washington Senators of the NL purchased McGann , Butts Wagner , Bob McHale and Cooney Snyder from Toronto for $ 8,500 ( $ 241,774 in current dollar terms ) on September 22 , 1897 . The Senators traded McGann with Gene DeMontreville and Doc McJames to the Baltimore Orioles of the NL for Doc Amole , Jack Doyle and Heinie Reitz that December . He played one season with the Orioles , in which he batted .301 with 106 runs batted in ( RBI ) in 1898 , good for fifth place in the NL . When Orioles manager Ned Hanlon was hired to manage the Brooklyn Superbas during the 1899 season , receiving an ownership stake in the team to do so , he assigned several of his star players , including McGann , Joe McGinnity , Joe Kelley , Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler to the Superbas . McGann finished second on the team in RBIs with 106 , behind Kelley . McGann batted .243 for the Superbas through July 14 , 1899 , when they traded him with Aleck Smith to the Senators for Deacon McGuire . For the Senators , McGann batted .343 during the rest of the 1899 season . Short on money , the Senators sold McGann and Gus Weyhing to the St. Louis Cardinals for $ 5,000 ( $ 142,220 in current dollar terms ) on March 9 , 1900 . McGann left the Cardinals before the end of 1901 season , for unknown reasons . The Cardinals replaced McGann with Bill Richardson . With the formation of the American League ( AL ) as a competitor to the NL , McGann joined many fellow NL players who jumped to the AL . Following Cardinals teammate John McGraw , who became player-manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season , McGann signed with the Orioles . However , the Orioles struggled with debt . Joe Kelley , star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon , reported that the team owed as much as $ 12,000 ( $ 328,200 in current dollar terms ) . Unable to afford that debt , Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw . With this , Mahon became the majority shareholder , owning 201 of the team 's 400 shares . On July 17 , 1902 , Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman , principal owner of the Giants , and John T. Brush , principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds , also of the NL . That day , Freedman released McGann , McGraw , Cy Seymour , Roger Bresnahan , Joe Kelley , Joe McGinnity , and Jack Cronin from their contracts with Orioles . Freedman signed McGann , Bresnahan , McGinnity and Cronin to the Giants , joining McGraw , who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier . Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds . With the Giants , McGraw installed McGann at first base , moving Christy Mathewson to pitcher . McGann stole 36 bases in the 1903 season . After the season , McGann and some of his Giants teammates threatened to quit the team due to the treatment of Brush , now the Giants owner , for allegedly going back on a promise to provide the Giants with a monetary bonus for having the Giants finish in the top three of the NL and a share of the gate receipts from exhibition games , in which they were paid $ 56.35 ( $ 1,484 in current dollar terms ) , though Brush allegedly had made over $ 200,000 ( $ 5,267,407 in current dollar terms ) . McGann and Jack Warner were rumored to join McGinnity in an outlaw league in California . McGann stole 42 bases in 1904 , finishing fourth in the NL . He stole five bases on May 27 , 1904 , setting an NL record . McGann 's record stood until Davey Lopes stole five bases in a game in 1974 , and Otis Nixon stole six in a game in 1991 . McGann led the team with a .286 batting average and six home runs that season . Though the Giants won the NL pennant in 1904 , they refused to compete in the 1904 World Series . Brush and McGraw refused to face the AL champion Boston Pilgrims , following their altercations with Johnson . McGann developed a reputation as a fighter in 1905 . On April 21 , 1905 , in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies , McGann punched catcher Fred Abbott after McGann was thrown out at home plate . Abbott hit McGann in the back with the ball , resulting in both players being ejected from the game . McGann batted .299 with 14 triples in 1905 as the Giants won NL pennant for the second consecutive year . Competing in the 1905 World Series , a series the Giants won over the Philadelphia Athletics in five games , McGann contributed with his bat and glove . Although McGann batted .235 in the series , he recorded four RBIs on three hits in a Game Three victory . McGann was briefly suspended by NL president Harry Pulliam for fighting on May 16 , 1906 . McGann finished first in the NL fielding percentage at first base from 1903 through 1906 . He also served as Giants ' team captain . Despite this , rumors began to circulate that the Giants were looking to trade McGann , which the team denied . Before the 1907 season , a report surfaced that the Giants would shift Mike Donlin from the outfield to first base , in order to replace McGann . Donlin denied the claim . McGann suffered a broken wrist when he was hit by a pitch thrown by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds during spring training in 1907 . McGann returned to the Giants out of shape midway through the 1907 season , although he did bat .298 that season . That winter , trade rumours began to swirl that the Giants would trade him to the Reds . Instead , the Giants traded McGann to the Boston Doves with Frank Bowerman , George Browne , Bill Dahlen and Cecil Ferguson for Al Bridwell , Tom Needham and Fred Tenney on December 13 , 1907 . Tenney , also a first baseman , was designated as McGann 's replacement at first . When a reporter asked McGraw about McGann and Tenney , pointing out that both first basemen were 36 years old , McGraw replied that Tenney had taken better care of himself . Despite discussion of appointing McGann player-manager of the Doves , the role was assigned to Kelley . Agreeing to terms with George Dovey , president of the Doves , McGann played 135 games during the 1908 season , but batted only .240 . During an April 1908 game between the Doves and the Giants , McGraw insulted McGann as slow , referring to him as a \" damned ice wagon \" , noting \" that 's how the Giants lost a lot of games last season \" . After the game , McGann went to the Giants ' hotel , waited for McGraw to return from the theatre , and fought him in a billiard room . Dovey released McGann from the Doves after the 1908 season . = = = Later career ( 1909 \u2013 1910 ) = = = McGann signed with the Milwaukee Brewers of the Class-A American Association for the 1909 season . He played for Milwaukee in 1909 and 1910 , batting only .225 in 1910 , his career low . There were reports McGann might sign with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League or a team in Louisville , Kentucky , near his Shelbyville home in 1911 . McGann 's career was ended , however , by his death in December 1910 . = = Personal life = = McGann invested in real estate and financial holdings near his Shelbyville home during his career .

In 1909 , another of McGann 's brothers committed suicide . = = Death = = On December 13 , 1910 , McGann committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart at a Louisville hotel . At the time of his death , he was 39 years old , and reportedly had been \" in the best of health and humor \" when last seen .

The storm made landfall in southwestern Florida at maximum strength , and moved northward , parallel to the U.S. East Coast before moving ashore on northeastern South Carolina . The storm caused flooding in seven counties within the state as a result of 5.05 inches ( 128 mm ) of rainfall . Winds peaked at 85 miles per hour ( 137 km / h ) which downed trees and power lines , and left 65,000 homes without power .

A hurricane watch was subsequently put into effect for coastal areas from Oregon Inlet to the North Carolina / Virginia border , although by August 15 all advisories were discontinued . Flood watches were also placed into effect for portions of the state . Governor Mike Easley declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm , and 200 National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte , Raleigh , Kinston and Lumerton , while 800 more were on standby . On Ocracoke Island , authorities ordered mandatory evacuations , while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place . Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks , warning tourists that a storm was approaching .

The outer rainbands began affecting the region in the early hours of August 14 . Due to widespread debris , storm drains became clogged which left flooding in some areas . Freshwater flooding was reported in seven counties along the coastal plain . State highways 42 and 581 , as well as numerous county and local roads , were covered with at least 1 foot ( 0.30 m ) of water . Wilmington and surrounding towns were forced to close a total of 20 streets . The heavy precipitation also caused the Neuse River to swell to flood stage . A few businesses throughout the region were damaged ; two in downtown Greenville and five others were flooded . The storm produced estimated storm surge of 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) to 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) , along with waves of up to 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) in height . However , there were isolated reports of 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) surge , particularly along the beaches of Brunswick County . This produced minor beach erosion along the coastline .

The trunkline runs through residential areas south of St. Joseph and through the central business districts of the twin cities . Further north , M-63 runs along the Lake Michigan shoreline . All of M-63 's routing was part of US 33 before that highway 's truncation south of Niles in 1986 . A previous designation of M-63 was used farther north in Lake and Osceola counties from 1919 until 1961 . Since the current designation was created , the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) has worked on reconfiguring parts of the roadway in the early part of the 21st century . The bridge M-63 uses to cross the St. Joseph River , the Blossomland Bridge , has been identified as an historic structure using a rare design . The bridge itself dates back to the late 1940s . = = Route description = = M-63 begins at the intersection of Niles , Scottdale and Miners roads southwest of St. Joseph in Royalton Township . M-139 runs on Niles Road northwest from Berrien Springs to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection . M-63 follows Miners Road west and then Niles Road northwest of the junction , parallel to the St. Joseph River through residential areas on the outskirts of the twin cities . The highway meets Interstate 94 ( I-94 ) at the latter 's exit 27 and continues through St. Joseph Township to the city of St. Joseph . In the city , after Washington Avenue , Niles Road becomes Niles Avenue and turns north . As part of its maintenance duties , the MDOT tracks traffic volumes on the state highways in a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the average traffic level for any day of a year . The roadway segment along Niles Avenue north of the Napier Avenue intersection in 2009 had the highest traffic levels along all of M-63 at 22,263 vehicles . At Main Street , Niles Avenue ends , and M-63 joins Business Loop I-94 ( BL I-94 ) on Main Street into and through the downtown business district . The two highways continue together running concurrently to Ship and Port streets . These two streets form a one-way pair running east to carry BL I-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River . M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into Benton Harbor , Michigan where it follows the Lake Michigan shoreline along a short expressway segment . The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near the headquarters of the Whirlpool Corporation . North of town , the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along the shoreline to the community of Lake Michigan Beach . When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road , M-63 turns east along that roadway to an interchange with I-196 / US 31 . The shoreline roadway continues northeast as A-2 ( Blue Star Highway ) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196 / US 31 . This northernmost segment of the highway had the lowest AADT measurement in 2009 when calculated by MDOT at 2,855 vehicles . Various highways in the United States are listed as a part of the National Highway System ( NHS ) , a system of roads important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . M-63 has been listed as a part of the NHS from its southern terminus to the northern junction with BL I-94 in St. Joseph . As the closest state highway to Lake Michigan in the area , M-63 from the southern junction with BL I-94 to its northern terminus has been used as a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour , a tourist route that circles Lake Michigan . = = History = = = = = Previous designation = = = M-63 originally ran from Peacock in Lake County west through Luther to M-13 ( later US 131 ) in Osceola County on July 1 , 1919 . This highway was extended in 1930 along US 131 to Tustin and then to a terminus with M-66 in Marion . At the same time , M-37 was extended north from Baldwin to meet M-63 east of Peacock . This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 when it was redesignated as part of M-61 . A short connector roadway , M-179 , was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US 131 , forming a small triangle of highways . The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to Peacock . The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960 , removing that short highway from the state trunkline highway system . M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control . = = = Current designation = = = The current designation of M-63 was created in 1986 . Before the designation , US 33 ran north into Michigan south of Niles . From there it followed US 31 north to Scottdale and ran alone to St. Joseph and Benton Harbor . When US 33 was truncated back to Niles , M-63 was commissioned in its place along the route it now follows . The expressway portion of M-63 is a relic of a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph \u2013 Benton Harbor area . The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000 \u2013 2002 , with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool 's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001 , and one of the two grade-separated interchanges , at Klock Road , demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002 . Today , there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway . = = = Blossomland Bridge = = = The Blossomland Bridge over the St. Joseph River is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

Those plans were delayed by World War II . The bridge was completed in late 1948 using the rare design prepared by a firm from Chicago that specialized in bascule bridges . The state paid a total of $ 1.3 million for what was called \" the largest bridge ever built under the auspices of the State Highway Department \" . = = Major intersections = = The entire highway is in Berrien County .",

The east end is located by the Keweenaw Bay of Lake Superior in the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community . There have been two highways in the state to carry the designation . The first was located in the southeastern Lower Peninsula . The current version of M-38 was created from a section of M-35 in the 1960s . This section was orphaned from the rest of M-35 when the highway was cancelled through the Huron Mountains . = = Route description = = M-38 begins at a four-way intersection in Ontonagon . US Highway 45 ( US 45 ) runs north \u2013 south through this intersection while M-64 runs west and M-38 runs east on Steel Street .

From here , M-38 forms a segment of the Lake Superior Circle Tour along Ontonagon \u2013 Greenland Road to a junction with M-26 near Greenland . The roadway runs through forest land and crosses several small streams while traveling southeasterly . Outside of Greenland , M-38 curves to the north around town after intersecting Plank Road . On the east side of town , M-26 and M-38 meet and join in a concurrency after Ontonagon \u2013 Greenland Road meets Plank Road a second time . The two highways run together for just over a mile to the unincorporated community of Lake Mine . There , M-38 turns south through the community while M-26 turns off to the northeast . The highway crosses a set of railroad tracks before turning east . At Post Office Road , M-38 meets a road named Old M-35 Road , a vestige of a highway straightening project during the time the highway was M-35 . M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Firesteel River in hilly terrain through this area . The highway continues east and provides access to the Courtney Lake National Forest Campground west of the Houghton County line . East of Federal Forest Highway 16 ( FFH-16 ) near Nisula , M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Otter River . It is along this section of roadway in Houghton County that the lowest annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) counts were measured by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) in 2007 . An average of 680 vehicles traveled on the roadway , according to MDOT surveys . Of those vehicles , only 40 trucks on average were included in the traffic counts . East of Nisula , the roadway runs parallel to Mill Creek . Mill Creek flows into the West Branch of the Sturgeon River near the Baraga County line . East of the county line is the crossing over the Sturgeon River south of Pelkie , home of the Baraga County Fairgrounds . The trunkline crosses more hilly terrain while veering to the northeast . Continuing to the east , M-38 had its highest traffic usage in 2007 . The AADT for the Baraga County segment of the highway was measured at 3,000 vehicles a day . The roadway continues east through Baraga County and runs downhill approaching Baraga and the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community , home of the first Native American casino in the United States . After passing through downtown Baraga on Michigan Avenue , M-38 ends at an intersection with US 41 ; on the western shore of Keweenaw Bay . = = History = = = = = Previous designation = = = The first version of M-38 was designated in 1919 in the Lower Peninsula .

M-35 was originally planned to start in Menominee and run north to Big Bay , turn west through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette County and run west from Baraga to Ontonagon . The Huron Mountains portion of M-35 was never built due to opposition from Henry Ford and the Huron Mountain Club . This left M-35 discontinuous . It was later routed along US 41 from Negaunee to Baraga , connecting the two sections until the western section was given the M-38 designation . The original routing of M-38 in the Upper Peninsula ran from M-26 at Greenland to Baraga . US 45 was rerouted in 1971 along M-26 from Rockland to Greenland and Ontonagon \u2013 Greenland Road between those two towns . M-26 was shortened to end at the new US 45 in Greenland . This change to US 45 was reversed in 1973 . M-26 was reextended to Rockland , and M-38 was extended along M-26 to Ontonagon \u2013 Greenland Road to meet US 45 in Ontonagon . On October 11 , 2006 , the western terminus of M-38 was relocated about .25 miles ( 0.40 km ) south to end at a junction with US 45 and the newly realigned M-64 . = = Major intersections = =",
                "Interstate 81 in West Virginia = In the U.S. state of West Virginia , Interstate 81 ( I-81 ) crosses the Eastern Panhandle region , linking Virginia to Maryland . The Interstate Highway , completed in 1966 , spans 26.00 miles ( 41.84 km ) through Berkeley County , paralleling U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) for its entire length . I-81 enters the state near Ridgeway and travels northeast , bypassing the city of Martinsburg , and leaves the state at the Potomac River , which serves as the state line . The first solicitations for the construction of I-81 were published in 1959 , with the first 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) of freeway being opened in 1963 , and the full length was completed by 1966 . On average between 45 and 60 thousand vehicles use the freeway though the panhandle per day . = = Route description = = I-81 enters the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia just west of Ridgeway , paralleling US 11 ( also known as the Valley Pike ) . The highway passes through some light farmland before entering a wooded area , north of Ridgeway . A welcome center for northbound travelers is passed before the woodlands give way to a light urban setting . As the highway approaches the community of Inwood , a diamond interchange with West Virginia Route 51 ( WV 51 ) provides access to the community , as well as Gerrardstown to the west of the freeway , and Charles Town to the east . A small business park is passed by before I-81 intersects County Route 32 , providing access to Arden , the Eastern WV Regional Airport and Tablers Station . The freeway turns more towards the north as it approaches Martinsburg , intersecting WV 45 , County Route 15 and Dry Run Road while in the city limits . I-81 bypasses downtown , running along the western border of town while US 11 continues through the town . Just northeast of Martinsburg the freeway passes over a CSX Transportation rail line while a cloverleaf interchange with WV 9 provides access back to Martinsburg and to Hedgesville . As the freeway curves back east , it intersects WV 901 between Hainesville and Falling Waters . WV 901 is a short connector route back to US 11 . North of Falling Waters and south of Marlowe , US 11 intersects the freeway and continues north while I-81 turns east towards the Maryland state line at the Potomac River . Just south of the river is a welcome center intended for southbound travelers from Maryland . Out of the six states that I-81 passes through , the segment in West Virginia is the second shortest , only longer than the Maryland segment . Every year the West Virginia Department of Transportation ( WVDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2009 , WVDOT calculated that as few as 45,000 vehicles traveled along the highway at the Virginia state line , and as many as 62,500 vehicles used the freeway between County Routes 15 and 13 in Martinsburg . As part of the Interstate Highway System , the entire route is listed on the National Highway System , a system of roads that are important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . = = History = = I-81 roughly parallels the Great Indian Warpath , an old Indian trail which connected New York to the Carolina Piedmont via Virginia and West Virginia . A series of roads linking Virginia to Maryland through Martinsburg were present on maps as early as 1873 . Bids for construction of I-81 by WVDOT were published in 1959 , with a budget of about $ 10.6 million to complete the highway . Completion of I-81 in Virginia up to the West Virginia state line was completed by the Virginia Department of Transportation in November 1965 . The first 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) of the highway through West Virginia were completed between 1959 and 1963 . The construction of the remaining 20 miles ( 32 km ) of Interstate Highway through the Eastern Panhandle was completed by 1966 . Since then , there have been no major realignments , and the highway continues on its original path . = = Future = = In 2014 , WVDOT officials announced in conjunction with the Maryland State Highway Administration that the bridges over the Potomac River would be rehabilitated to accommodate three lanes of highway in each direction . The widening of the highway is proposed to head south along I-81 to exit 23 for US 11 . Construction is expected to start in the summer of 2016 . = = Exit list = = The entire route is in Berkeley County .",

The highway travels north as Montlake Boulevard from an interchange with SR 520 and over the Montlake Bridge to the University of Washington campus in the University District . SR 513 continues past University Village before it turns northeast onto Sand Point Way and ends at the entrance to Magnuson Park in the Sand Point neighborhood . SR 513 was created during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Secondary State Highway 1J ( SSH 1J ) , itself created in 1937 and traveling from Downtown Seattle to Lake City . Sections of SSH 1J , including Madison Street from Downtown to Capitol Hill , date as far back as 1854 . Most sections of the highway were built in the 1890s and 1900s in preparation for the Alaska \u2013 Yukon \u2013 Pacific Exposition , which took place on the University of Washington campus in 1909 . SR 513 was shortened in 1971 to its present southern terminus , the interchange with SR 520 in Montlake , and to an interchange with Interstate 5 ( I-5 ) on the Seattle \u2013 Shoreline city border . In 1991 , the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus at Magnuson Park , eliminating its route through Lake City and much of North Seattle . = = Route description = = SR 513 begins at the intersection of Montlake Boulevard and Lake Washington Boulevard in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle , part of a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 520 . The highway travels north on Montlake Boulevard and crosses the Montlake Cut section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal on the 320-foot-long ( 98 m ) Montlake Bridge . The bascule drawbridge is designated as a city landmark and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982 . SR 513 continues north through the University of Washington campus within the University District and passes Husky Stadium and the Hec Edmundson Pavilion before it becomes parallel to the Burke-Gilman Trail . The highway turns east onto 45th Street and Sand Point Way at the University Village shopping mall and enters the Sand Point neighborhood near Seattle Children 's Hospital . SR 513 continues northeast along the Burke-Gilman Trail past the Seattle branch of the National Archives before the highway ends at an intersection with 65th Street west of Magnuson Park . Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 513 was within the University of Washington campus , serving 41,000 vehicles , while the least busiest section was its northern terminus at Magnuson Park , serving 14,000 vehicles . The entire route of SR 513 is part of the National Highway System , identifying it as important to the national economy , defense , and mobility . = = History = = SSH 1J , the predecessor to SR 513 , was added to the state highway system in 1937 and traveled 13.40 miles ( 21.57 km ) within the city of Seattle on streets that have existed since the 19th century . Madison Street , which carries SSH 1J from its southern terminus at U.S. Route 99 in Downtown to Capitol Hill was built in 1864 by local judge John J. McGilvra to connect his homestead at Madison Park to downtown . Other streets carrying SSH 1J , including 23rd and 24th Avenues towards Montlake , Montlake Boulevard through the University District , and Sand Point Way towards Sand Point were built during the early 1890s as the city of Seattle expanded . The rest of SSH 1J , traveling northwest from Naval Station Puget Sound at Sand Point through Lake City to US 99 on the border between Seattle and Shoreline via Roosevelt Way and 145th Street was constructed by the late 1900s to serve the University of Washington campus , site of the Alaska \u2013 Yukon \u2013 Pacific Exposition in 1909 . SSH 1J was replaced by SR 513 during the 1964 state highway renumbering and codified in 1970 on its original route , connecting Downtown Seattle to Montlake and Lake City . In 1971 , SR 513 was shortened to 9.22 miles ( 14.84 km ) by moving its southern terminus to an interchange with SR 520 in Montlake and its northern terminus to an interchange with I-5 at 145th Street . The highway was further shortened , to its present length of 3.35 miles ( 5.39 km ) , in 1991 by moving its northern terminus from I-5 to Magnuson Park at the site of the former Naval Station Puget Sound . = = Major intersections = = The entire highway is in Seattle , King County .",

Throughout most of Montgomery County , MD 97 is known as Georgia Avenue , which continues south from the southern terminus along US 29 into Washington , D.C. It is a suburban four- to six-lane divided highway from Silver Spring north to Olney . From here , the route continues as a rural two-lane road north through Brookeville and into Howard County . MD 97 continues through Carroll County where it passes through the county seat of Westminster . The route intersects many major roads , including Interstate 495 ( I-495 , Capital Beltway ) north of Silver Spring , MD 200 ( Intercounty Connector ) in Aspen Hill , MD 28 in Norbeck , I-70 and US 40 in Cooksville , MD 26 in Dorsey Crossroads , and MD 27 , MD 32 , and MD 140 in the Westminster area . With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , present-day MD 97 north of Westminster became a part of US 140 . MD 97 was first designated by 1933 from MD 27 / MD 410 ( now US 29 ) in Silver Spring to north of US 40 in Cooksville . Two portions of the route between Cooksville and Westminster became MD 570 in 1939 . In 1956 , MD 97 was extended north from Cooksville to the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg , Frederick County . It replaced the two sections of MD 570 and replaced the MD 32 designation between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border . MD 97 was rerouted to bypass Westminster in 1960 and was moved to a new alignment between Westminster and Taneytown in 1965 ; both former alignments became MD 32 . In 1961 , the route was realigned between MD 26 and MD 32 , with the former segment becoming MD 854 .

Upon leaving this community , the route continues through woods and farm fields . A short distance later , MD 97 reaches the Pennsylvania border , where it becomes PA 97 and continues north into Adams County . = = History = = In 1911 , Georgia Avenue was proposed as a state highway between the Washington , D.C. border and Brookeville . This section of state highway was completed by 1915 . By 1921 , a state highway was proposed between Roxbury Mills and Cooksville , with a small piece completed to the south of Cooksville . Also , a state highway was completed between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border , connecting to a road that continued northwest to Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . By 1923 , the state road was finished between south of Cooksville and north of Roxbury Mills and to the north of Cooksville . With the creation of the U.S. Highway System on November 11 , 1926 , the portion of present-day MD 97 north of Westminster was designated as part of US 140 , a U.S. Highway that ran from Baltimore to Gettysburg . In addition , the portion of Georgia Avenue between Norbeck and Olney was designated as part of MD 28 in 1927 . The state highway was completed south to Roxbury Mills in 1928 . By 1933 , the state road between Brookeville and Roxbury Mills was finished . MD 97 was designated by 1933 to run from MD 27 / MD 410 ( now US 29 ) in Silver Spring to north of US 40 in Cooksville . In 1935 , a state highway was finished south of the MD 26 west Eldersburg and heading south from MD 32 in Fenby . Both these highways were extended south about 0.5 miles ( 0.80 km ) in 1938 . In 1939 , the state highway running south from MD 26 west of Eldersburg and from MD 32 south of Fenby were both designated as MD 570 . By 1946 , the MD 28 concurrency between Norbeck and Olney was removed . The southern section of MD 570 was extended south 0.5 miles ( 0.80 km ) again in 1948 . MD 97 was widened into a divided highway between Silver Spring and Glenmont in 1950 . In 1956 , MD 97 was extended north to the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg , Frederick County . The route ran north from Cooksville to Fenby , replacing both sections of MD 570 , before it replaced MD 32 from Fenby north to Westminster and northwest through Taneytown and Emmitsburg . In 1960 , MD 97 was moved to a new alignment that bypassed Westminster along newly constructed New Washington Road between Fenby and US 140 and the Westminster Bypass to the northwest side of the city . MD 32 was designated onto the former alignment of MD 97 that passed through Westminster on Washington Road and Main Street . In 1961 , MD 97 was shifted to a new alignment to the east between MD 26 and MD 32 ; the former alignment became MD 854 . The intersection with MD 26 was replaced with an interchange in 1962 . In 1964 , construction began on a new alignment of MD 97 slightly to the north between Westminster and Taneytown . This alignment was completed in 1965 , and the former alignment became a part of MD 32 ( now MD 832 ) . In 1966 , the divided highway portion of MD 97 was extended north from Glenmont to MD 28 in Norbeck . In 1977 , plans were made for US 140 to be decommissioned , with MD 97 to replace the section between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border , where it would connect to PA 97 . This proposal was made in order to eliminate short routes from the U.S. Highway System . The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved the removal of the US 140 designation on October 28 , 1977 . On January 1 , 1979 , MD 97 was rerouted at Westminster to head north to the Pennsylvania border , replacing US 140 . At the Pennsylvania border , the route connected to PA 97 , which replaced the US 140 designation in Pennsylvania . Meanwhile , the former alignment of MD 97 between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg became a part of MD 140 . Dualization of MD 97 in Montgomery County was extended further north from MD 28 to MD 108 by 1989 . There are plans to build an interchange at the route \u2019 s intersection with Randolph Road in order to improve movements for automobiles as well as for pedestrians and bicycles accessing the nearby Glenmont Metro station .

In 1939 , the route was shortened to its east \u2013 west section between Montezuma and Deep River as Iowa 21 was extended and it supplanted Iowa 85 south of Deep River . Iowa 85 was paved in the mid-1950s ; until then , the highway had been a gravel road . In the early 1960s , Iowa 21 was straightened through Keokuk County near Guernsey and Deep River . This caused the eastern end of Iowa 85 to move east back to the point where it had turned into an east \u2013 west route in the 1930s . The route would remain this way for nearly thirty years . In 1994 , the westernmost one mile ( 1.6 km ) of Iowa 85 was turned over to the City of Montezuma . The route now begins at the eastern city limits .

                    "text": "Queer ( song ) = \" Queer \" is a song written and produced by alternative rock band Garbage for the band 's self-titled debut album . The song started as a demo during sessions between band members Butch Vig , Duke Erikson and Steve Marker , and had its composition finished after singer Shirley Manson joined the band . Manson rewrote the sexualized lyrics to be more ambiguous , and rearranged the song into a subdued trip hop and rock crossover structure . In 1995 , \" Queer \" was issued as the band 's fourth single in the United Kingdom and second internationally . The song quickly became a modern rock success for the fledgling band , with positive reviews from music journalists , and becoming their first top 20 hit in both the UK Singles Chart and Billboard 's Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart . It also earned attention with its music video by St\u00e9phane Sednaoui , which featured Manson detaining , stripping and shaving a man from a first-person perspective . The video earned much airplay on MTV and was nominated for Breakthrough Video at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards . = = Composition = = \" Queer \" began as a rough demo around January 1994 , recorded during informal studio sessions between Butch Vig , Duke Erikson and Steve Marker in Marker 's home basement recording studio in Madison , Wisconsin . The band had been jamming using an ADAT eight-track , AKAI samplers , and a small drum kit . The band had written around five songs that they felt were pretentious and lyrically simple and literal . They did not want Erikson to sing , even though he was a competent singer , because they wanted to avoid sounding like their previous band Spooner . Vig and Marker were uncomfortable with their vocals so tended to bury them deep in the mix or distort them with effects ; on \" Queer \" , Vig recorded a \" scratch vocal \" consisting of him screaming his way through . The recorded work was later discarded , which Vig explained was because the trio discovered that the musical experiments they were attempting \" [ don 't ] work when you 're trying to write a song and put it in a context that works \" . Vig 's inspiration for \" Queer \" came from a novel he had read about \" about this woman who was hired to go and make this guy 's son a ' man ' . The kid is missing a few marbles . But then he realizes that the women [ sic ] who came to his room is also fucking his father . \" After Marker saw Shirley Manson 's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes , the band invited her to Vig and Marker 's Smart Studios to sing on a couple of songs . One of the compositions was \" Queer \" , whose incomplete lyrics forced Manson to ad-lib in an audition that was described as \" dreadful \" . The singer afterwards returned to Angelfish , which folded shortly later . Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second audition and then began working on the songs Vig , Marker and Erikson had created . Manson rewrote \" Queer \" into a trip hop arrangement and added ambiguous lyrics that allowed the listener to make up their own mind about what the song was about . She also re-sang the \" Queer \" vocal in an understated style . It was then that the band knew that Garbage was going to work . Garbage incorporated a sample of the drumline from Australian band Single Gun Theory 's track \" Man of Straw \" on \" Queer \" ; this loop was layered with an additional drum part performed by Madison percussionist Clyde Stubblefield , who was known for being the most sampled drummer in history for his uncredited part on James Brown 's \" Funky Drummer \" . Vig opted to hire Stubblefield to play on the record rather than sample him as \" you don 't use a sample when the genius who played the sample lives down the street from you \" , and the drummer also contributed to album cut \" Not My Idea \" . Bass guitar parts were completed by Milwaukee session bassist Mike Kashou . The band wanted to sample a clarinet part from a Frank Sinatra record , but the licensing for the sample would have been prohibitively expensive . Mulling over some options , such as having a session musician interpolate the part themselves still led to having to pay a large royalties . The idea was dropped . The band still liked the idea of using a clarinet , and recorded a part by Les Thimming on the final mix . Manson later explained , \" It 's not , as you might think , to do with being gay , but tolerance . My granny has the expression ' Or 's queer , except thee and me , and sometimes even thee 's queer ' , that is that you think you are normal and the rest of the world is freaky , but we 're all equally to blame \" . Garbage did not write the song to particularly appeal to the gay community , however Erikson stated : \" As musicians , we 're totally open to [ the song 's gay appeal ] . There 's been enough exposure to gay issues in the mainstream media that people are finally ready to deal with it . Even if it 's something controversial , people are still beginning to open up \" . Erikson added : \" The song isn 't about sex at all , it 's about the loss of innocence \" . = = Single release = = Almo Sounds released \" Queer \" as the band 's second single to alternative radio in the United States at the end of August 1995 , upfront of August 15 North American release date of Garbage . The song debuted at the end of September on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 30 . The following week , Garbage debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 193 , having spent the previous four weeks as a rising Heatseekers title . At the beginning of October , \" Queer \" debuted at number 62 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart , peaking a week later at number 57 . In mid-November , remixes of \" Queer \" were sent to clubs . \" Queer \" peaked at 12th on the Modern Rock chart in its ninth week , but did not earn enough airplay to chart in the Billboard Hot 100 . The song eventually finished its run on the Modern Rock chart in December 1995 , for a total of 14 weeks . On October 23 , 1995 , \" Queer \" was issued as the band 's second single in Australia and New Zealand . White issued a three-track CD single and cassette single backed with two newly recorded tracks , \" Girl Don 't Come \" and \" Sleep \" , which had been recorded for the UK release of \" Only Happy When It Rains \" . \" Queer \" peaked at number 55 in Australia , spending twelve weeks on the ARIA top 100 singles chart . In New Zealand , \" Queer \" debuted on the RIANZ charts at number 45 at the start of November , rising to a number 37 peak three weeks later . Across Europe , \" Queer \" was issued by BMG in a similarly configured CD single ; a three-track release backed with \" Girl Don 't Come \" and \" Sleep \" . In Belgium 's Wallonia-region , \" Queer \" peaked at number 24 at the end of January 1996 . \" Queer \" debuted and peaked at 7th in Iceland the following month . In Spain , \" Queer \" peaked at number 33 on the airplay chart . In April 1996 , performed \" Queer \" live on French television show Nulle Part Ailleurs and headlined a show at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Montmartre in Paris ; BMG France released a three-track CD single of \" Queer \" featuring \" Trip My Wire \" and the Rabbit in the Moon remix . Initially , Mushroom Records had scheduled \" Queer \" to be the lead single for the UK release of the debut album Garbage , matching the international single release strategy . At last minute , it was decided to release \" Only Happy When It Rains \" upfront of the album , with \" Queer \" rescheduled to later in 1995 to coincide with the band 's first UK live show . \" Queer \" was quickly picked up by radio , and was B-listed by Radio One , whose breakfast slot DJ Chris Evans championed it as his \" Single of the Week \" , and playlisted by Virgin Radio . \" Queer \" reached number 35 on the airplay chart . Mushroom issued the single on a limited edition 7 \" vinyl and a gold and silver CD single set on November 20 , 1995 . Each CD single was backed with a newly recorded track ; \" Trip My Wire \" on the first and a cover version of The Jam 's \" Butterfly Collector \" on the second ( the cover later featured in The Jam compilation album Fire and Skill ) . Four remixes of the title track were spread out across the CDs , with one also appearing on the flipside of the vinyl . Early indications showed that the single had a midweek position of 10 , however at the end of its first week on-sale , \" Queer \" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 13 . That week , Garbage made a live appearance to perform the single on Top of The Pops , and performed both \" Queer \" and \" Only Happy When it Rains \" on MTV 's Most Wanted . = = = Collector 's format = = = As the band had received significant attention from the special packaging of their first three releases , \" Queer \" was also released in this manner . Mushroom 's product manager had a longer time to design the package than the other singles ; this was a result of \" Queer \" being held back three months so that \" Only Happy When It Rains \" could launch the album . Garbage 's original suggestion for \" Queer \" was to create a jade velvet box , but Mushroom vetoed the idea over the cost . The label sourced a plastics company to create the case , which was made from injection-molded polystyrene , similar to the process of manufacturing jewel cases . The company charged Mushroom \u00a3 10,000 to have the mould created . The end product was finished with frosted effect for the \" G \" logo , which was stickered , and within placed the vinyl record in a card picture sleeve ; this cost Mushroom \u00a3 2.21 per unit ( a loss of 95p for each sale ) . This special single had only 5,000 copies issued . = = Critical reception = = Upon both the release of Garbage and the release of \" Queer \" as a single , the song received a positive reception from music journalists . Leo Finlay , in a Music Week article highlighting the campaign for the debut album 's release wrote , \" ' Queer ' is eerily reminiscent of Magazine 's stranger moments \" . A reviewer for NME wrote that the single was \" an ode to recognising and tolerating those mis-shapen ones among us \" , and when reviewing the album , their own Shannon O 'Connell wrote , \" there is a bit of Pat Benatar in [ this songs ] back-alley swagger \" . A reviewer for VOX described \" Queer \" as \" Voice of the Beehive roughing up L7 \" , Jackie Hinden of Hot Press wrote that the song was \" a slinky work-out against a restrained work-to-rule industrial backing \" , and the publication later made it their Single of the Fortnight , describing it as \" Almost indecently brilliant . There 's an intelligence at work here in the lyrics and in the music which makes \" Queer \" a unique proposition , and Garbage utterly indispensable \" . A writer for Melody Maker wrote that \" Queer \" was \" sleek , cultivated perversion ... sinister and menacing \" , while Raw 's review described it as \" brilliant , Seductive and slow-burning \" , and the single reviewer for NME considered that Manson 's performance \" elevates a sing-song shuffle into a lullaby to sexual non-conformity \" . Rolling Stone described the song as a \" more roundly shaped tune orchestrated with this same love of junk and command of finesse . \" Kerrang ! rated \" Queer \" as their Single of the Week , stating \" an incredible knee-trembling fuck tune ... the dirtiest pop tune you 'll hear all year . [ You 'll be ] sucked into dark satin sexiness and you 'll never want to leave . Gorgeously decadent and utterly fabulous \" ; = = Track listings and formats = = \" Queer \" was the first Garbage single to include remixes as a commercial b-side ; Mushroom spread four across the UK formats . These were completed by producers Adrian Sherwood , Danny Saber , Depeche Mode 's Martin Gore and Florida-based group Rabbit in the Moon . In 2007 , the Heftybag mix by Rabbit in the Moon was remastered and included on the limited edition of greatest hits collection Absolute Garbage . = = Music video = = The music video for \" Queer \" directed by St\u00e9phane Sednaoui for Propaganda Films and was filmed in July 1995 in Los Angeles . Sedanoui 's video concept developed from his own personal experience of being \" shredded into pieces \" by a beautiful woman . Garbage loved his storyboard for \" Queer \" , feeling it matched the ambiguous nature of the song . Manson had chosen Sednaoui as director after she saw the \" Big Time Sensuality \" music video he directed for Bj\u00f6rk , and later said that Sednaoui \" doesn 't just take an idea and apply it to different artists , he seems to be able to figure out where the artist is coming from and make the photographs and the videos unique to that group . \" The black and white storyline of the video saw a young male 's first person perspective of exiting an elevator onto a Los Angeles street and meeting Manson . She coyly entices him to follow her to her home where the men from Garbage are waiting . They detain him inside , forcing him up onto the second-level of the house , where Manson throws him to the floor , strips him of his clothing and blinds him with gaffer tape . He recovers to find Manson shaving his head , before she drags him outside by his legs . He is then seen strangely happy , and in full colour , leaving the street . Sednaoui operated the camera for the whole shoot . To capture the victim 's struggle , Sednaoui positioned the camera at ground-level facing upwards towards Garbage , who were standing on a rotating platform . To suggest the victim was almost hallucinating , strobe lighting was combined with the rotation of the platform , however the effect caused the band to suffer from vertigo after a number of takes . Manson later claimed that the video helped establish her group ; \" He really defined for us who we were visually . St\u00e9phane was able to look at the band and listen to the music and figure out what was the perfect visual partner for the band . People think we 're a very stylish band , and it 's all to do with him \" . She added , \" I 'm really proud of \" Queer \" , I think it 's one of our best videos . \" The \" Queer \" video premiered on North American networks on August 14 , 1995 ; where it was given heavy support by MTV , who certified it a Buzz Clip . MTV requested an edit to obscure the shot of Manson blinding the video 's protagonist before playlisting it . The music video for \" Queer \" was nominated in the Breakthrough Video category at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards , losing to Smashing Pumpkins ' \" Tonight , Tonight \" . The silver dress Manson wore in the video was later donated to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas , Nevada for indefinite display . The \" Queer \" video was first commercially released , accompanied with out-take footage from the shoot , on 1996 's Garbage Video VHS and Video-CD . A remastered version was included on Garbage 's 2007 greatest hits DVD Absolute Garbage and made available as a digital download via online music services the same year . = = Release history = = = = Comprehensive charts = =",

                    "text": "Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth = Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth , known in Japan as Gyakuten Kenji ( Japanese : \u9006\u8ee2\u691c\u4e8b , lit . \" Turnabout Prosecutor \" ) , is a 2009 single-player adventure video game developed by Capcom for the handheld video game console Nintendo DS . It was published in Japan on May 28 , 2009 , and in North America , Australia , and Europe , in February , 2010 . It is the fifth game in the Ace Attorney series , and is set between the events of the third and fourth games , Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2212 Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice : Ace Attorney . While previous games in the series focus on defense attorneys , Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth , who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring . The game consists of investigation phases , in which the player investigates crime scenes in search for evidence , and rebuttal phases , in which they confront other characters , to hear what they think has happened ; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters ' statements , to get closer to the truth . The game was directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro . Eshiro had come up with the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations , and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation . The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles , with a larger focus on the environment . The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye , a character from earlier games in the series , as the lead character , but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity . They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth , as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games , where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters ; to do this , they included direct control of Edgeworth , and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts . It was met by generally favorable reviews , with a common complaint being that rebuttals at times devolve into trial and error . The game was one of the best selling games of 2009 in Japan , while Western sales were described as \" poor at best \" . After the game 's release , a manga series based on it has been released . A sequel , Ace Attorney Investigations 2 , was released in 2011 ; it has not been released officially outside Japan , but a fan translation of it has been made . = = Gameplay = = Ace Attorney Investigations is a single-player adventure game in which players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth , who investigates five cases . The game is mostly presented from a third-person perspective , occasionally switching to a first-person view when examining evidence . Each case involves playing through several investigation phases and rebuttal phases . During investigation phases , players control Edgeworth directly , either with the D-pad , or by sliding the map that is displayed on the bottom screen . The player has Edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence ; they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases , who they can talk to . As Edgeworth notices various things in the crime scene , they are saved as Edgeworth 's thoughts . Using the \" logic \" function , the player can connect two such thoughts to gain new information ; for instance , by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once , Edgeworth will conclude that two guns must have been at the crime scene . At some points , the player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of the crime scene ; by using the \" deduction \" function at these points , the player is able to point out a contradiction between the crime scene and evidence . If the player successfully points out a contradiction , they gain access to new information . At certain points , a device called Little Thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of the crime scene ; by investigating these reproductions , the player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden . As more evidence is uncovered , the hologram is updated . After having examined an area sufficiently , the investigation phase ends , and the game moves on to a rebuttal phase . In the rebuttal phases , a witness or a rival character provides their idea of what has happened . The player is able to press them for details , and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying . By doing this , the player gets closer to the truth ; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases . Upon solving a case , the episode is cleared and a new episode is made available to the player . If the player makes mistakes throughout the game , such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence , attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up , or making incorrect choices , a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases , representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth . If it is completely emptied , the game ends . By clearing an investigation phase , half of the gauge is restored , and by clearing an episode , the gauge is restored completely . = = Plot = = = = = Setting and characters = = = Ace Attorney Investigations takes place between the third and fourth games in the series , Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2212 Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice : Ace Attorney . The story is split into five episodes , each focusing on a different crime , and tying together to form an overarching story revolving around an international smuggling ring . While previous Ace Attorney games feature defense attorneys Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as the lead characters , Ace Attorney Investigations features prosecutor Miles Edgeworth , who was Phoenix 's rival in previous games . Among the supporting characters are Kay Faraday , who claims to be the Yatagarasu , a legendary thief who works to expose illegal corporate dealings , and detective Dick Gumshoe , Edgeworth 's long-time partner . Recurring rivals of Edgeworth 's are Shi-Long Lang , an Interpol agent from the fictional country of Zheng Fa who bears a fierce hatred of prosecutors and the courts after his family 's reputation was tarnished by a corrupt prosecutor , and his assistant Shih-na . Other characters include prosecutor Byrne Faraday , detective Tyrell Badd , and defense attorney Calisto Yew . Prosecutor Franziska von Karma , a character who first appeared in Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2212 Justice for All , also appears in the game . = = = Story = = = The backstory of the game is described in the fourth case , Turnabout Reminiscence . Ten years prior to the game 's present , the secretariat of the Cohdopian Embassy was accused of murdering Cece Yew , a witness to a smuggling ring 's connection to the embassy . Prosecutor Byrne Faraday and detective Tyrell Badd attempted to convict the secretariat , but he went free after key evidence was stolen . Feeling that the justice system was powerless to those who stand above the law , Faraday , Badd , and Yew 's sister Calisto , started stealing corporate files detailing illegal or unethical activities and exposed them to the media , under the name Yatagarasu . Three years later , another murder occurred at the embassy . During the trial , in which Faraday was the prosecutor , the suspect , Mack Rell , claimed that he had been told by Faraday to commit the murder , and said that Faraday was the Yatagarasu . A recess was held to replace Faraday with another prosecutor , Miles Edgeworth ; before court was reconvened , both Rell and Faraday were found dead . Edgeworth discovered that Calisto had murdered Faraday with help from Rell , then killed Rell and made it look like Faraday and Rell had killed each other . When confronted , Calisto says that she is Yatagarasu , not mentioning her two partners , and that she is part of the smuggling ring . Faraday 's daughter Kay is comforted over Faraday 's death by Edgeworth , Badd , and detective Gumshoe ; she believes her father to be the true Yatagarasu , and vows to catch the fake . The game 's second case , Turnabout Airlines , takes place in the present , and has Edgeworth becoming involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard an airliner . An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip , and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects . Another prosecutor , Franziska von Karma , works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring ; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant , who is working with the smuggling ring . In the third case , The Kidnapped Turnabout , Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano , whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park . While attempting to exchange the ransom money , Edgeworth is also kidnapped , but is freed by Kay , who calls herself the true Yatagarasu . They release Lance , and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon , who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers . As Edgeworth investigates the mystery , he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na , who believe that Amano 's business group is involved with the smuggling ring ; the ring 's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa , so they seek to bring an end to the ring . Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to get money from his father , and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan . Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring , and Lang brings Amano in for questioning . In the first case , Turnabout Visitor , Edgeworth finds a dead body in his office . He learns that the murderer was Jacques Portsman , a prosecutor who was working for the smuggling ring , and was trying to steal evidence from the murder ten years ago from Edgeworth 's office ; as a detective got too close , Portsman killed him . The fifth case , Turnabout Ablaze , takes place at the former Cohdopian embassy ; civil tension in Cohdopia forced the country to split into Allebahst and Babahl , which share the same embassy building . The two countries planned to announce their reunification at the embassy when the fake Yatagarasu appeared , setting fire to the building and killing two people . The bodies are found at the embassies ' respective offices ; one of them is discovered to be the former secretariat of the Cohdopian embassy , who now was the secretariat for Babahl . Shih-na is revealed to be Calisto in disguise ; she insists that she did not murder the secretariat , and is revealed to be an accessory to the crime . As she is taken away , she reveals that she is not Cece 's sister , that \" Calisto \" was just an alias she took while working for the smuggling ring , and that she became part of Yatagarasu on orders from the ring 's leader . Edgeworth reveals the ring 's leader to be Allebahst 's and formerly Cohdopia 's ambassador Quercus Alba , who had committed murders and covered the tracks of the ring , and brought counterfeit money into Zheng Fa . Alba , Amano and others are convicted of their crimes , while Edgeworth and his companions recommit to their vows to defend the truth . = = Development = = The game was directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro , with character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto , and music by Noriyuki Iwadare and Yasuko Yamada . Eshiro got the idea to make a new game featuring characters from the original Ace Attorney games while working on Trials and Tribulations . According to Eshiro , the game was made for portable play , and has an interface that uses the touch screen ; as this could not be replicated on other platforms such as Xbox Live , he said that the Nintendo DS was the platform that was best suited for it , and that no ports to other hardware were planned . = = = Production = = = Eshiro said that they could have set the game in a courtroom similar to that of the main series and made a few additions , but that it would not have been very interesting ; instead they moved the game to crime scenes , and added several new gameplay elements . Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation . Because of this theme , it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game , as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist . Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character , but based on fan feedback , they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead . Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team . The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series . Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch , Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had . The concept of the story was that while each case is a standalone episode , they are also all interlinked , forming a larger mystery , with each episode revealing a piece of the puzzle . Because Edgeworth is portrayed as a genius prosecutor , whereas Phoenix Wright is a rookie attorney , the development team felt that they needed to come up with incidents that were larger in scale for Ace Attorney Investigations , to match Edgeworth 's skill level ; therefore , the opponents were made \" more formidable \" compared to the ones in previous games in the series . Eshiro saw the story as the most important part of the game , and said that , while time consuming , it was important to make sure that it works . This was accomplished through a lot of trial and error , and several rewrites and revisions : Yamazaki would come up with an idea , which was tested to see if players had a hard time understanding it . Based on feedback from the testers , Yamazaki would rewrite and reorder some parts , and add hints . When creating the game 's story , the development team took into account that some players might not have played any Ace Attorney games before . Because of this , they tried to make the game as accessible as possible , and make it playable without first having played any of the previous titles ; for instance , the first part of the game is a tutorial that introduces the game and the characters . They did however add in-jokes for players who had played previous Ace Attorney games . Kay Faraday was the first new character that was created for the game , and was cited by Eshiro as one of his favorite characters . The development team felt that with previous Ace Attorney games , players could identify with Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice ; for Ace Attorney Investigations , they wanted players to be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth . He said that they think players will feel a connection with Edgeworth and understand his character . As examples of this , Eshiro cited the ability to directly control Edgeworth , and the possibility to see inside his head : the game 's logic system was created because the development team wanted to show how Edgeworth thinks . It represents what is happening inside his mind , which Eshiro describes as a \" very cool , calm and collected way of thinking \" . For the rebuttal phases in the game , Eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles : during rebuttals , several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace , providing the player with evidence , to create drama with tension . Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had ; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects ' statements , whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is to find things at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has . The game 's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series ' first person perspective , and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it . The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations , with the aim of being different from the main series ; therefore , Eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within the Investigations series , and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles . The development team put effort into trying to make Edgeworth look right ; Eshiro described Edgeworth 's running animation as \" graceful , while exerting effort \" , while Iwamoto was not entirely convinced and thought it looked like he is \" walking really fast accidentally \" . Eshiro and Yamazaki wanted to add a lot of features to the Little Thief system , but due to time constraints it ended up more simplistic than they had originally envisioned . Eshiro used his experience with producing action games such as Shadow of Rome and laying out scenes to get backgrounds to move smoothly without scrolling issues when Edgeworth moves . The programmers faced big technical challenges and had to make significant modifications to the game when implementing the graphics : in the game , two animated characters - whose graphics each are larger than those in previous Ace Attorney games - appear simultaneously and on top of smaller \" mini-avatar \" graphics . Eshiro said that he thinks they pushed the graphic processing ability of the Nintendo DS system to its limits for this . Eshiro said that they would consider making DSiWare episodes if demand was high enough , but that they did not have any plans at the time . He said that there were many technical aspects to consider , such as memory limitations for DSiWare . = = Promotion and release = = The game was announced in Famitsu in April 2008 . A demo of the game was made available at Tokyo Game Show 2008 . It was also shown at San Diego Comic-Con International 2009 , and appeared once more at Tokyo Game Show in 2009 . The game was published by Capcom on May 28 , 2009 , in Japan , on February 16 , 2010 , in North America , on February 18 , 2010 , in Australia , and on February 19 , 2010 , in Europe . A limited edition version of the game was made available in Japan , containing a business card holder , promotional videos , a CD with five tracks from an Ace Attorney concert performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra , a pamphlet from the concert , a game box , and a copy of the game itself . A bundle containing an Ace Attorney Investigations themed Nintendo DSi and a copy of the game was also made available in Japan . The soundtrack album Gyakuten Kenji Original Soundtrack was released on June 24 , 2009 , by Suleputer . = = = Localization = = = For the game 's localization , the main focus was to keep the dialogue natural and accessible to Western players , while also staying true to the Japanese version . The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes , which would not have worked if they had been translated literally . There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization , but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version . The team found difficulties in getting the Western version 's tone right , as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting , and at the same time avoid inconsistencies with the original version 's tone . = = Reception = = Ace Attorney Investigations holds a score of 78 / 100 on the review aggregator Metacritic , indicating generally favorable reviews . The game sold 172,000 units in the week of its release in Japan , and 42,000 the following week ; by the end of 2009 , it was the 33rd best selling game of the year in Japan , with 303,445 copies sold . On the other hand , Capcom USA 's vice president described Western sales as \" poor at best \" . The game won an Aggie Award for Best Character of 2010 , for Miles Edgeworth , and was awarded for Best Adventure Title of 2010 on Nintendo DS by Nintendo World Report . Following the game 's appearance at Tokyo Game Show in 2008 , it was awarded a Japan Game Award in the \" future \" category . Austin Boosinger at Adventure Gamers said that the gameplay changes compared to the main series were mostly superficial , resulting in a game that is similar to but worse than the main series . Neal Ronaghan at Nintendo World Report did on the other hand feel that there had been enough changes for the game to feel fresh , and said that it was possibly the best entry in the Ace Attorney series . Hilary Goldstein at IGN said that the new gameplay elements were strong additions that add variety to the game , but felt that the series was running out of steam . Steven Hopper at GameZone said that the game was very similar to previous Ace Attorney games , on good and bad , and that the Ace Attorney series was starting to show its age . Laura Parker at GameSpot said that the game was a \" successful twist \" on the gameplay of the previous games in the series , and that it \" lacked none of the magic \" of them . Boosinger called the game too easy and streamlined , and found the Logic system to be too simple . He did however feel that finding contradictions in testimonies was \" fantastic as always \" , while too reliant on trial and error . Ronaghan said that many solutions in the Rebuttal phases are \" binary \" - while it makes sense to present a piece of evidence at several points , the game accepts only one of them . He found the controls to be fine , but called the touch screen-based walking controls \" awkward and imprecise \" . Goldstein similarly found problems with multiple pieces of evidence that all could point to the same contradiction , but where the game would only allow a specific one . At other times , she said that no reasonable solution could be found , forcing her to guess . John Walker at Eurogamer also complained about how reasonable solutions sometimes are not accepted . Hopper said that solving cases isn 't intuitive enough , and involves a lot of trial and error . While some puzzles made sense to him , others were frustrating . Parker called the gameplay exciting , and said that the game has depth and variety , but that it is too easy at times . Boosinger said that while the game retains the comedy of the Ace Attorney series and has great character writing , he found the story to be dull , slow , and too long . Ronaghan called the dialogue funny , and said that the game was well-paced , long , and enjoyable . Goldstein called the story interesting , but said that it at times plays out \" like a bad soap opera \" . Walker appreciated the choice to make Edgeworth the game 's lead character , and called Kay a fantastic addition . He found the translation of the game to be incredible , despite a number of spelling mistakes . Hopper appreciated that the game has a new protagonist and setting , and called the dialogue \" cheesy but charming \" . On the other hand , he said that there is a lot of superfluous text in the game , making the cases longer than they need to be . Parker said that it takes some time to get used to playing as Edgeworth , saying that he is not as immediately engaging as Phoenix and Apollo . She called the story deep and intricate , and slow but solid . Ronaghan called the art style and presentation wonderful , and said that each character \" oozes with personality \" , but that the animation , while better than that in previous titles , was limited to only a few frames at a time . Goldstein called the characters colorful , but found the locations to be uninteresting . Hopper called the game 's aesthetic \" anime-esque \" and clean , and said that the static images were decent . Parker liked the game 's presentation , and called the environments \" beautifully drawn \" . = = = Legacy = = = A manga based on the game , written by Kenji Kuroda and drawn by Kazuo Maekawa , premiered in 2009 in Kodansha 's Weekly Young Magazine . Kodansha also released the manga in North America in four volumes between July 31 , 2012 , and January 29 , 2013 . The second and third volume ranked 7th and 8th , respectively , on The New York Times Manga Best Seller List for one week each in 2012 . In 2011 , an attraction based on the game was opened in the amusement park Joypolis in Tokyo . A stage play based on game is planned to run in July 2016 in Tokyo . A sequel to the game , Ace Attorney Investigations 2 , was released in Japan on February 3 , 2011 . There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally , but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet . In July 2013 , Eshiro said that he and Yamazaki would like to make a third Investigations game , and that he intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan everything out in the future , but that he could not make any promises .",

It is a shoot ' em up with two-dimensional graphics . The game is set in the year 2084 in a fictional world where robots have turned against humans in a cybernetic revolt . The aim is to defeat endless waves of robots , rescue surviving humans , and earn as many points as possible . Robotron popularized the twin joystick control scheme , one that had previously been used in Taito 's Space Dungeon . Robotron : 2084 was critically and commercially successful . Praise among critics focused on the game 's intense action and control scheme . The game is frequently listed as one of Jarvis 's best contributions to the video game industry . Robotron : 2084 arcade cabinets have since become a sought-after collector 's item . It was ported to numerous platforms . = = Gameplay = = Robotron is a 2D multi-directional shooter game in which the player controls the on-screen protagonist from a top-down perspective . The game is set in the year 2084 in a fictional world where robots ( \" Robotrons \" ) have taken control of the world and eradicated most of the human race . The main protagonist is a nameless superhuman attempting to save the last human family . The game uses a two-joystick control scheme ; the left joystick controls the on-screen character 's movement , while the right controls the direction the character 's weapon fires . Both joysticks allow for an input direction in one of eight ways . Each level , referred to as a \" wave \" , is a single screen populated with a large number of various enemy robots and obstacles ; types include invincible giants to robots that continually manufacture other robots that shoot the protagonist . Coming into contact with an enemy , projectile , or obstacle costs the player one life , but extra lives can be earned at certain point totals . Waves also include human family members who can be rescued to score additional points , but certain robots can either kill them or turn them into enemies . Destroying all vulnerable robots allows the player to progress to the next wave ; the cycle continues until all reserve lives are lost . = = Development = = Robotron : 2084 features monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch CRT monitor . It uses a Motorola 6809 central processing unit that operates at 1MHz . To produce multiple sounds on a single audio channel , the game uses a priority scheme to generate sounds in order of importance . A custom graphics coprocessor \u2014 which operates as a blitter chip \u2014 generates the on-screen objects and visual effects . The coprocessor increases the transfer speed of memory , which allows the game to simultaneously animate a large number of objects . The game was developed in six months by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar , founders of Vid Kidz . Vid Kidz served as a consulting firm that designed games for Williams Electronics ( part of WMS Industries ) , whom Jarvis and DeMar had previously worked for . The game was designed to provide excitement for players ; Jarvis described the game as an \" athletic experience \" derived from a \" physical element \" in the two joystick design . Robotron : 2084 's gameplay is based on presenting the player with conflicting goals : avoid enemy attacks to survive , defeat enemies to progress , and save the family to earn points . It was first inspired by Stern Electronics ' 1980 arcade game Berzerk and the Commodore PET computer game Chase . Berzerk is a shooting game in which a character traverses a maze to shoot robots , and Chase is a text-based game in which players move text characters into others . The initial concept involved a passive main character ; the object was to get robots that chased the protagonist to collide with stationary , lethal obstacles . The game was deemed too boring compared to other action titles on the market and shooting was added to provide more excitement . The dual joystick design was developed by Eugene Jarvis , and resulted from two experiences in Jarvis 's life : an automobile accident and playing Berzerk . Prior to beginning development , Jarvis injured his right hand in an accident \u2014 his hand was still in a cast when he returned to work , which prevented him from using a traditional joystick with a button . While in rehabilitation , he thought of Berzerk . Though Jarvis enjoyed the game and similar titles , he was dissatisfied with the control scheme ; Berzerk used a single joystick to move the on-screen character and a button to fire the weapon , which would shoot the same direction the character was facing . Jarvis noticed that if the button was held down , the character would remain stationary and the joystick could be used to fire in any direction . This method of play inspired Jarvis to add a second joystick dedicated to aiming the direction projectiles were shot . Jarvis and DeMar created a prototype using a Stargate arcade system board and two Atari 2600 controllers attached to a control panel . In retrospect , Jarvis considers the design a contradiction that blends \" incredible freedom of movement \" with ease of use . The developers felt a rescue theme similar to Defender \u2014 one of their previous games \u2014 was needed to complete the game , and added a human family as a method to motivate players to earn a high score . The rescue aspect also created a situation where players had to constantly reevaluate their situation to choose the optimal action : run from enemies , shoot enemies , or rescue humans . Inspired by George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four , Jarvis and DeMar worked the concept of an Orwellian world developed into the plot . The two noticed , however , that 1984 was approaching , but the state of the real world did not match that of the book . They decided to set the game further in the future , the year 2084 , to provide a more realistic timeframe for their version of \" Big Brother \" . Jarvis , a science fiction fan , based the Robotrons on the idea that computers would eventually become advanced entities that helped humans in everyday life . He believed the robots would eventually realize that humans are the cause of the world 's problems and revolt against them . Jarvis and DeMar playtested the game themselves , and continually tweaked the designs as the project progressed . Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels , the developers chose a single screen to confine the action . To instill panic in the player , the character was initially placed in the center of the game 's action , and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions , as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian , where the enemies attacked from a single direction . This made for more challenging gameplay , an aspect Jarvis took pride in . Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes . Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones . The level of difficulty was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages . In retrospect , Jarvis attributes his and DeMar 's average player skills to the game 's balanced design . Though they made the game as difficult as they could , the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players . The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen , and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion . Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce clutter . Of special note is that Robotron had a major defect where the game would reset ( Carpet pattern reset / watchdog reset ) if a specific scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer in a corner of the screen . In 1987 , Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem . A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game . = = = Enemy designs = = = Each enemy was designed to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character ; random elements were programmed into the enemies ' behaviors to make the game more interesting . The first two designed were the simplest : Electrodes and Grunts . Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters , and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him . Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups . While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies , Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay 's excitement and fun . As a result , they began steadily increasing the number of on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment . Other enemies were created to add more variety . Large , indestructible Hulks , inspired by an enemy in Berzerk , were added to kill the humans on the stage . Though they cannot be destroyed , the developers decided to have the protagonist 's projectiles slow the Hulk 's movement as a way to help the player . Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character ; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt it would be easier to animate . A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence . The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character 's constant motion would always result in a miss . Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable ; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character , and random acceleration curves the trajectory . To further differentiate Enforcers , Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers , rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies . Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs . DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game 's difficulty ; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen , and Quarks as a tank-producing robot . In the summer of 2012 , Eugene Jarvis wrote a comprehensive evaluation of the Robotron Enemy Dynamics : The game is hard-coded with 40 waves , whereupon the game repeats wave 21 to 40 over and over until the game restarts back to the original wave 1 , once the player completes wave 255 . In the summer of 2012 , Larry DeMar also provided details about how to trigger the secret room in Robotron . = = Reception = = Robotron : 2084 was commercially successful ; Williams sold approximately 19,000 arcade cabinets , and mini cabinets and cocktail versions were later produced . The different arcade versions have since become varying levels of rarity ; the cocktail and cabaret versions are very rare , while the upright cabinets are more available . It is one of the most collected arcade games , and is consistently higher priced than other titles among collectors . The game has been positively received by critics . Author David Ellis called Robotron : 2084 a \" classic favorite \" of its time , and stated that , despite the game 's difficulty , it is among the most popular video games in the industry . Retro Gamer rated the game number two on their list of \" Top 25 Arcade Games \" , citing its simple and addictive design . In 2008 , Guinness World Records listed it as the number eleven arcade game in technical , creative and cultural impact . Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame called it one of the industry 's \" most exciting and intense \" games . He complimented the gameplay , graphics and audio , calling them addictive , colorful and energized respectively . The game has garnered praise from industry professionals as well . Midway Games 's Tony Dormanesh and Electronic Arts ' Stephen Riesenberger called Robotron : 2084 their favorite arcade game . David Thiel , a former Gottlieb audio engineer , referred to the game as the \" pinnacle of interactive game design \" . Xot 's John Leffingwell described Robotron : 2084 as \" the perfect blend of mayhem and simplicity \" , and commented that its plot was an interesting commentary . Jeff Peters from GearWorks Games praised the playing field as \" crisp and clear \" , and described the strategy and dexterity required to play as a challenge to the senses . He summarized the game as \" one of the best examples of game play design and execution . \" Critics lauded Robotron : 2084 's gameplay . Authors Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson enjoyed the excitement created by the constant waves of robots and fear of the character dying . They considered it one of the more impressive games produced from the 80s and 90s . Author John Vince considered the reward system ( saving humans ) and strategic elements as positive components . ACE magazine 's David Upchurch commented that despite the poor graphics and basic design , the gameplay 's simplicity was a strong point . The control scheme in particular was well received . DeMaria and Wilson considered it a highlight which provided the player a tactical advantage . Owen Linzmayer of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games praised the freedom of movement afforded by the controls . Ellis commented that the unique control scheme was a factor in the game 's success . Retro Gamer lauded the controls , describing them as \" one of the greatest control systems of all time . \" In retrospect , DeMar felt players continued to play the game because the control scheme offered a high level of precision . = = Legacy = = Jarvis 's contributions to the game 's development are often cited among his accolades . Vince considered him as one of the originators of \" high-action \" and \" reflex-based \" arcade games , citing Robotron : 2084 's gameplay among other games designed by Jarvis . In 2007 , IGN listed Eugene Jarvis as a top game designer whose titles ( Defender , Robotron 2084 , and Smash TV ) have influenced the video game industry . GamesTM referred to the game as the pinnacle of his career . Shane R. Monroe of RetroGaming Radio called Robotron \" ... the greatest twitch and greed game of all time . \" Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra commented that Robotron 's success , along with Defender , illustrated that video game enthusiasts were ready for more difficult games with complex controls . Though not the first to implement it , Robotron : 2084 's use of dual joysticks popularized the design among 2D shooting games , and has since been copied by other arcade-style games . The control scheme has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games : Inferno , Smash TV , and Total Carnage . Many shooting games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network use this dual control design . The 2003 title Geometry Wars and its sequels also use a similar control scheme . The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with three-dimensional ( 3D ) graphics became popular in the late 1990s . Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market to the absence of hardware that offered two side-by-side joysticks . Most 3D games , however , use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement of a character and a camera . Few console games , like the 2004 title Jet Li : Rise to Honor , use two joysticks for movement and attacking . = = = Remakes and sequels = = = Jarvis planned to produce sequels , but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game production for a few years . Prior to the full effects of the crash , Vid Kidz developed an unofficial sequel ( Blaster ) in 1983 . The game is set in the same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons . Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation . The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers . It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64 . In addition to the graphical update , the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles . Though the game features similar gameplay as the original , it was not as well received . Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the moving camera in the 3D environment a negative update . They felt the original format \u2014 an overhead perspective of a single screen \u2014 presented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player 's skill . The moving camera angle , however , obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by an enemy that suddenly appeared . Vince echoed similar statements , stating that the gameplay suffered from the loss of important aspects from the original . Rollings and Adams , however , attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron X 's release . Robotron : 2084 has been remade on different platforms . Beginning in 1983 , the game was ported to several platforms including the Atari 5200 , Atari 7800 , Apple IIe , Commodore 64 , and TI-99 / 4A . Most conversions did not have a dual joystick and were received less favorably by critics . In 2000 , a web-based version of Robotron : 2084 , along with nine other classic arcade games , were published on Shockwave.com ( a website related to Adobe Shockwave ) . Four years later , Midway Games also launched a website featuring the Shockwave versions . The game has been included in several multi-platform compilations : the 1996 Williams Arcade 's Greatest Hits , the 2000 Midway 's Greatest Arcade Hits , the 2003 Midway Arcade Treasures , and the 2012 Midway Arcade Origins . It also appeared in an expansion to Lego Dimensions . In 2004 , Midway Games planned to release a plug and play version of Robotron : 2084 as part of a line of TV Games , however , it was never released . Robotron : 2084 became available for download via Microsoft 's Xbox Live Arcade in November 2005 . In February 2010 , however , Microsoft removed it from the service citing permission issues . The Xbox Live version included high-definition graphics and two-player cooperative multi-player with one player controlling the movement and another the shooting . Scores were tracked via an online ranking system . The game has also inspired other titles . The 1990 arcade game Smash TV , also designed by Jarvis , features a similar design \u2014 two joysticks used to shoot numerous enemies on a single screen \u2014 as well as ideas he intended to include in sequels . In 1991 , Jeff Minter released a shareware game titled Llamatron based on Robotron : 2084 's design . Twenty years later , Minter released an upgraded version titled Minotron : 2112 on the iPhone . = = Reverse engineering work = = Annotated reverse engineering of the Robotron 2084 arcade game can be found at http : / / www.seanriddle.com = = Robotron II = = The video game crash of the early 80 's saw the VidKidz disband before creating Robotron 's sequel . DeMar went back to pinball development and Jarvis went back to college . Later , both went on to entertainment industry successes with hits in pinball , racing games , light gun games , casino games , and social media games . Robotron II remained a forgotten project , never to be implemented . = = In other media = = The robots attacking the player show up in the movie \" Pixels \" , near the end where the arcade characters begin a full-on attack on Earth . The game is also mentioned in the novel Ready Player One as protagonist Wade Watts ' favorite video game .

It served as a chapel of ease to another church in the area , St Ceidio 's . Some restoration work was carried out in the 19th century , but St Mary 's has since fallen into disuse and is now largely in ruins . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is \" a late Medieval church of exceptionally simple character \" , and is virtually unaltered despite its poor condition . One writer has said that St Mary 's \" has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in Anglesey \" . = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is in the countryside in Rhodogeidio , in Anglesey , north Wales . It is about 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) north of Llannerch-y-medd , towards the north of Anglesey . It is reached by a footpath from a farm \u2013 it is only accessible on foot \u2013 and is surrounded by a churchyard . It was built in the 15th century as a chapel of ease to serve St Ceidio 's Church , Rhodogeidio , about 0.75 miles ( 1.25 km ) to the east . Restoration work was carried out in the 19th century , but the church later fell into disuse . It has been in ruins since sometime between 1937 , when the survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded its condition as \" fair \" , and 1970 , when it was given listed building status and its \" very poor \" condition noted . = = Architecture and fittings = = St Mary 's is a small church , measuring 30 feet by 12 feet 3 inches ( about 9.1 by 3.7 m ) . It dates from the late medieval period , and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones . It had a slate roof , although most of the roof has now gone , and there is a bellcote at the west end , which may be original rather than a later addition . There is no physical division between the nave and the chancel , although one account in the 19th century said that there had originally been a screen separating them , and some traces of it still remained at that time . Entrance to the church was through a doorway with a square head , in the north wall at the west end ; this dates from the 19th century . An inscribed stone near the doorway has the date 1798 and some initials , and it has been suggested that this marked the date of some renovation work . There are two windows on the south wall , one fully blocked and one partially blocked . The small window at the east end of the church dates from the latter part of the 15th century . Inside , little remains , but the ruins still have most of the original roof trusses ( one , at the west end of the church , is a replacement ) . There are some slate memorial tablets on the walls , dating from the middle of the 19th century , and a plain 12th-century circular font . The 1937 survey noted a bell dating from 1717 and some portions of 17th-century panelled seating near the pulpit ; these were not recorded when the church was given listed status in 1970 . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" .

                "St Edwen 's Church , Llanedwen = St Edwen 's Church , Llanedwen is a 19th-century parish church near the Menai Strait , in Anglesey , north Wales . The first church was founded here by St Edwen ( daughter of Edwin of Northumbria , king and saint ) in 640 , but the present structure dates from 1856 and was designed by Henry Kennedy , the architect of the Diocese of Bangor . It contains some memorials from the 17th and 18th centuries and a reading desk that reuses panel work from the 14th and 17th centuries . The 18th-century historian Henry Rowlands was vicar here , and is buried in the churchyard . The church is on land that forms part of the Plas Newydd estate , home of the family of the Marquess of Anglesey since 1812 and owned by the National Trust . Some of the Marquesses of Anglesey , and some of their employees , are also buried in the churchyard . The church is used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of seven in a combined parish . A service is held using the Book of Common Prayer each Sunday morning . St Edwen 's is one of the few churches in regular use in Wales to be lit entirely by candles . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is regarded as \" a good example of H Kennedy 's designs for a small-scale rural church . \" = = History and location = = St Edwen 's Church is in the south of Anglesey , north Wales , in a rural area known as Llanedwen . It is about 5 miles ( 8 km ) from the county town of Llangefni , about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) from the A4080 road between Llanfairpwllgwyngyll and Brynsiencyn and about 250 metres ( 270 yds ) from the Menai Strait that separates Anglesey from the rest of Wales . The church is on land that forms part of the Plas Newydd estate , which has been the home of the family of the Marquess of Anglesey since 1812 ; some of the former marquesses and their employees are buried in the churchyard . Plas Newydd and its grounds are now owned by the National Trust . The area of Llanedwen takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" . According to the 19th-century Anglesey historian Angharad Llwyd , the first church in the area was established by St Edwen in 640 . Nothing is known of Edwen 's life , but according to the manuscript sources , she was the daughter \u2013 perhaps the illegitimate daughter \u2013 or the niece of Edwin of Northumbria , a king who converted to Christianity in 627 and who was venerated as a saint after his death in 633 . The 12th-century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth said that Edwin was born whilst his mother was taking refuge in north Wales with Cadfan ap Iago . Llwyd described the church in 1833 as \" a small but neat edifice , of great antiquity \" . In 1840 , the church was rebuilt by John Welch . Writing in 1847 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that St Edwen 's was in the Early Perpendicular style , although its windows had been replaced , and measured 52 by 16 feet ( 16 by 5 m ) . The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited in May 1850 . He said that it was \" a very small church in a lovely situation \" , which had \" a beautiful view over the Menai \" . In 1856 , the church seen by Llwyd , Jones and Glynne was demolished and the present structure was erected , designed by Henry Kennedy , architect of the Diocese of Bangor . The only part of the old church to survive was some of the stonework at the base of the west wall . Some repair work was carried out in 1956 . St Edwen 's , which is used for worship by the Church in Wales , is one of seven churches in the combined benefice ( churches grouped together under an incumbent priest ) of Bro Dwynwen . A service is held every Sunday morning using the 1662 Book of Common Prayer , either Holy Communion or Morning Prayer ; there are no midweek services . The parish is within the deanery of Synod Ynys Mon , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2016 , the priest in charge is the Reverend E Roberts and the associate priest is Canon Professor Leslie Francis . People associated with the church include Henry Rowlands , vicar of St Nidan 's , Llanidan , and its associated churches ( including St Edwen 's ) in the first part of the 18th century . He wrote a history of Anglesey entitled Mona Antiqua Restaurata , published in 1723 . He is buried in the churchyard to the west of the door . His tombstone is inscribed in Latin with the words : \" All things are nought save what he gave to needy ones . These have force when arts perish and writings fall to pieces . \" William Bulkeley Hughes , who lived in the parish and died in 1882 , is also buried in the churchyard . He was a Member of Parliament for 40 years . The churchyard contains one Commonwealth war grave , of a First World War officer of the Westmorland and Cumberland Yeomanry . = = Architecture and fittings = = St Edwen 's is built from local red gritstone , formed into square blocks and dressed with sandstone . The roof is made from slate with stone edging . The church , which is in the Late Decorated style , has a tower topped with a broach spire at the north-west corner of the nave , supported by buttresses . The church is entered through a porch with an arched doorway in the lowest of the three stages of the tower . Inside , the woodwork of the roof is exposed ; some of the nave timbers might be medieval beams reused in the 1856 rebuilding . The nave and chancel are divided by an arch and by three steps leading up from the nave . The chancel and sanctuary are separated by an altar rail set on top of some wooden panels . There is a pair of windows in the west wall decorated with tracery ( stonework within the window frame forming a pattern ) . Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass , and birds ( phoenix and peacock ) are depicted at the top of the windows . The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes , a clergyman who died in 1801 . There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave ; the stained glass of the easternmost ( dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes ) shows biblical scenes . The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes ( who died in 1836 ) , his wife and children . The chancel has one window in the east wall , which has three lights ( sections of window separated by stone mullions ) . The pulpit has some 19th-century oak panelling and reuses some ornate 17th-century panel work that is decorated with pictures of cherubs , dragons , dogs and lions ' heads . The pews are made of pine ; the choir stalls also have some carved oak panels that may date from the 17th century . A reading desk from the 19th century reuses material from the 14th and 17th centuries , depicting a lion , a griffin and angels . The church also has an eight-sided sandstone font decorated with a carved cross . A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded seven 17th and 18th century memorials within the church , the oldest in memory of a Thomas Owen who died in 1646 . The tombs in the churchyard include one of a Sidney Griffith ( died 1618 ) and more than 20 others from the 17th and 18th centuries . The survey also noted some oak dog tongs , likely to be from the 19th century , and three 17th-century chairs . A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded an engraved chalice dated 1842 and a paten dated 1776 \u2013 77 ; both are made from silver and are decorated with foliage . A silver flagon bears an inscription to denote that it was given by William Bulkeley Hughes when the new church was consecrated in 1856 . The survey also noted a flagon from about 1700 and a dish , both made of pewter , but said that an 18th-century silver chalice had been lost some time after 1811 . St Edwen 's is one of the few churches in regular use in Wales to be lit only by candles . = = Assessment = = St Edwen 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 23 April 1998 , and has been listed because it is seen as \" a good example of H Kennedy 's designs for a small-scale rural church \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the fittings that incorporate \" some fine carved work of the 14th and 17th centuries . \" Sabine Baring-Gould , writing in 1908 , said that the rebuilt church was \" wholly devoid of interest \" . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region notes that the Incorporated Church Building Society ( active in the 19th century ) considered Kennedy 's design was \" inconsistent with the gravity of feeling which pervades the ancient churches of Wales . \" Harry Longueville Jones wrote in 1847 that the churchyard was \" one of the most interesting in Anglesey , from its picturesque appearance and situation . \" A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes St Edwen 's as \" a good example of an unspoilt 19th century country church \" , adding that is \" little changed since it was built . \" It says that it is in a \" tranquil spot \" , and notes that it is a landmark \" visible from a considerable distance \" .",
                "Chester Rows = Chester Rows consist of covered walkways at the first floor behind which are entrances to shops and other premises . At street level is another set of shops and other premises , many of which are entered by going down a few steps . The Rows , found in each of the four main streets of the city of Chester , Cheshire , England , are unique ; nothing precisely similar exists anywhere else in the world . Dating from the medieval era , the Rows may have been built on top of rubble remaining from the ruins of Roman buildings , but their origin is still subject to speculation . In some places the continuity of the Rows has been blocked by enclosure or by new buildings , but in others modern buildings have retained the Rows in their designs . Undercrofts or \" crypts \" were constructed beneath the buildings in the Rows . The undercrofts were in stone while most of the buildings in the Rows were in timber . Today about 20 of the stone undercrofts still exist , but at the level of the Rows very little medieval fabric remains . Many of the buildings containing portions of the Rows are listed and some are recorded in the English Heritage Archive . The premises on the street and Row levels are used for a variety of purposes ; most are shops , but there are also offices , restaurants , caf\u00e9s , and meeting rooms . Chester Rows are one of the city 's main tourist attractions . = = Description = = At street level the shops and other premises are similar to those found in other towns and cities , although many of the premises are entered by going down a few steps . On the first floor level are more shops and other premises , set back from the street , in front of which is a continuous walkway . The storey above this overlaps the walkway , which makes it a covered walkway , and this constitutes what is known as the \" Row \" . On the street side of the walkways are railings and an area which was used as shelves or stalls for the display of goods . The floors above the level of the Rows are used for commercial or domestic purposes , or for storage . The Rows are present , to a greater or lesser degree , in all the streets radiating from Chester Cross , namely Watergate Street , Northgate Street , Eastgate Street and Upper Bridge Street . They are continuous on both sides of Upper Bridge Street , along most of Watergate and Eastgate Street , but only for a short stretch along the east side of Northgate Street . Originally there were also Rows in Lower Bridge Street but these were blocked during the 17th and 18th centuries . As the ground floor buildings are usually lower than the street level , they are sometime known as \" crypts \" . However , as the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner points out , this is not a strictly accurate description because the level of the floors of the buildings is a half-storey rather than a full-storey level below the street . = = Origins = = Rows were built in the four main streets leading from Chester Cross , each of which originated during the settlement 's early development . In the Roman period the main street , now Watergate Street and Eastgate Street , lay on an east-west axis . It was joined at what is now Chester Cross by the main road from the south , present-day Bridge Street . During the Saxon period a road to the north was added , now called Northgate Street . Dendrochronological evidence shows that the Rows go back as far as the 13th century , but it is unlikely that they originated before 1200 . The first record of the Rows appears in 1293 , although it is uncertain whether it refers to a Row as it would be recognised today . The \" earliest unambiguous instance \" of the use of the term for an elevated walkway is in 1356 . Because the Chester Rows are unique and their precise origins are unknown , they have been the subject of speculation . Chester has suffered from a series of fires . In 1278 the fire was so severe that almost the entire town within the walls was destroyed . It has been suggested that following this fire , the owners were ordered to make their ground floors fireproof , leading to the stone-lined undercrofts . From this , the suggestion has been made that there was \" a general undertaking by the citizens of Chester ... to improve the commercial potential of their property by providing two-level access for customers \" . Another theory links the Rows with the debris left from the Roman occupation of Chester . The rubble from the Roman buildings which had fallen into ruin was piled up alongside the streets . It is suggested that in the medieval period buildings were constructed along the top of this debris . The buildings were set back from the street , a footpath passed in front of them , and wheeled vehicles passed along the street below . In time , the properties were improved and , possibly during the 13th century , cellars or undercrofts were excavated in the debris beneath them . When the buildings were further improved , upper stories were built which overlapped the lower storey , providing a covered walkway . Stalls or shelves were added on the street side of the walkway for the display of goods , and so the system of Rows was developed . In a few places , for example at the corner of Eastgate Street and Northgate Street , another building was constructed between the walkway and the street . It is thought that , apart from a relatively small number of later buildings , the system of the Rows had reached its full extent by about 1350 . = = Medieval period = = During the medieval period the Rows gave access to living accommodation . The doorway led into a hall , which was usually at right angles to the street . In some cases the front portion of the hall was used as a separate shop , and in other cases the whole hall was the shop . In the storey above the hall was the solar , a room providing private accommodation for the residents . In some cases , where the hall was larger , there were several shops on its frontage . Below the Rows , at street level , were crypts or undercrofts . Many of these were stone-lined with ribbed vaults , and they were used for storage or for selling more valuable goods . Behind the hall , on the level of the Rows , was more domestic accommodation . Normally the kitchen was a separate building in the yard behind the house . The back yard was also used for cesspits and for the disposal of rubbish . = = Subsequent development = = Although many of the Rows are still continuous , in some areas they have been blocked . In Lower Bridge Street there was originally a continuous Row ; the first building to break the sequence was at the north end of the street , the public house now known as The Falcon . In the 17th century this was the town house of the Grosvenor family . It was rebuilt in 1626 , maintaining its section of the Row . However in 1643 , during the Civil War siege of Chester , Sir Richard Grosvenor moved his family there from his country estate at Eaton Hall . In order to increase the size of the house he gained permission to enclose the Row . This set the fashion for other houses in Lower Bridge Street to enclose their sections of the Row . Later , completely new houses were constructed which did not incorporate the Row . One of these was Bridge House , built by Lady Calveley in 1676 ; it was the first house in Chester to be designed in neoclassical style . In 1699 John Mather , a lawyer , gained permission to build a new house at 51 Lower Bridge Street , which also resulted in the loss of part of the Row . In 1728 Roger Ormes , rather than building a new house , enclosed the Row at his home , Tudor House , making it into an additional room . During the Georgian era more sections of the Rows were blocked , especially by commercial development on the north side of Watergate Street . In 1808 Thomas Harrison designed the Commercial Coffee Room in Northgate Street in neoclassical style , with an arcade at the ground-floor level , rather than continuing the Row on the first floor . In 1859 \u2013 60 Chester Bank was built in Eastgate Street , again obliterating its part of the Row . However other architects continued the tradition of maintaining the Rows in their designs ; examples include the Georgian Booth Mansion of 1700 in Watergate Street , T. M. Penson 's Gothic Revival Crypt Chambers of 1858 in Eastgate Street , and buildings in modern style constructed in Watergate Street in the 1960s . = = Today = = About 20 stone undercrofts still exist , some of them vaulted , dating from the 13th or early 14th century . One of the finest is Cowper House at No. 12 Bridge Street , with an undercroft of six bays built in sandstone rubble . It has plain rib-vaulting on plain corbels ; the ribs are single-chamfered . On the other side of Bridge Street , at No. 15 , is another undercroft , this one having two double-chamfered arches . The Falcon , in Lower Bridge Street , has an undercroft which formerly had three bays but which has now been divided into two chambers . At No. 11 Watergate Street is a two-naved undercroft with four bays . Also in Watergate Street are undercrofts at Nos. 23 and 37 , the latter having 5 \u00bd bays . Crypt Chambers , at No. 28 Eastgate Street , has a four-bay undercroft . At the Row level , the medieval building was usually built in timber , and few examples remain . One which does remain is the building known as Three Old Arches . Consisting of three arches , the frontage of this shop is stone and is probably the earliest identified shopfront in England . The building also retains its undercroft and hall , the latter also built in stone . According to the records in the English Heritage Archive , 14 buildings incorporate sections of Chester Rows . The records in the National Heritage List for England show that at least 95 of the buildings containing sections of the Rows are listed ; 9 of these are listed as Grade I , 20 as Grade II * , and 66 as Grade II . The National Heritage List for England records the uses made by the premises at street level and in the Rows . Most of these are shops , but other uses include offices , restaurants and caf\u00e9s , and private dwellings . The building at No. 1 Bridge Street has shops at both street and Row levels . A department store occupies the street and Row levels ( and the storey above ) of Crypt Chambers . Bishop Lloyd 's House in Watergate Street has a shop at the street level and above this there are meeting rooms , and the office of Chester Civic Trust . As of 2010 , Booth Mansion , also in Watergate Street , contains a solicitors ' office . The former St Michael 's Church , which is now a heritage centre , includes part of Bridge Street Row in the lowest stage of its tower . A remaining example of a section of a Row with a building between the walkway and the street is No. 22 Eastgate Street . Since 1995 access to the Rows has been improved by a pedestrianisation scheme , which affects all the streets containing Rows . Most vehicles are prohibited from using the area between 08 : 00 and 18 : 00 , although unloading is allowed until 10 : 30 and from 16 : 30 . Chester Rows are a major tourist attraction in the city because of their unique nature , their attractive appearance , and the covered shopping experience they provide . On 7 July 2010 it was announced that Chester Rows were being considered as an applicant for the new United Kingdom Tentative List for World Heritage status by the Department of Culture Media and Sport .",
                "Lynde Point Light = The Lynde Point Light or Lynde Point Lighthouse , also known as Saybrook Inner Lighthouse , is a lighthouse in Connecticut , United States , on the west side of the mouth of the Connecticut River on the Long Island Sound , Old Saybrook , Connecticut . The first light was a 35 feet ( 11 m ) wooden tower constructed by Abisha Woodward for $ 2,200 and it was completed in 1803 . A new lighthouse was eventually needed and a total of $ 7,500 was appropriated on July 7 , 1838 . Jonathan Scranton , Volney Pierce , and John Wilcox were contracted to build the new 65-foot ( 20 m ) octagonal brownstone tower . It was constructed in 1838 and lit in 1839 . The lighthouse was renovated in 1867 and had its keeper 's house from 1833 replaced in 1858 with a Gothic Revival gambrel-roofed wood-frame house . In 1966 , the house was torn down and replaced by a duplex house . The original ten lamps were replaced in 1852 with a fourth-order Fresnel lens , and with a fifth-order Fresnel lens in 1890 . Lynde Point Lighthouse used whale oil until 1879 when it switched to kerosene . It was electrified in 1955 and fully automated by the United States Coast Guard in 1978 . In 1990 , it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and is significant for its \" superior stone work in the tapering brownstone walls \" . = = First light = = Out of a need for a lighthouse to mark the Old Saybrook harbor , the government paid $ 225 for William Lynde 's land at its entrance to erect a light . Abisha Woodward was contracted to build a 35 feet ( 11 m ) wooden tower for $ 2,200 and it was completed in 1803 . Due to erosion threatening the foundation of the lighthouse , a seawall was constructed in 1829 , and it was reinforced and widened in 1831 . Also constructed was a six-room frame structure to serve as the keeper 's quarters . The keeper 's building was replaced in 1933 . The light was criticized by many sailors for being too short to be seen at an effective distance , a problem exacerbated by a local fog from the marshland that obscured the light . A petition was made to have the tower raised 25 feet ( 7.6 m ) , but it was deemed a replacement would be better . = = Current light = = The United States Congress appropriated funds for the tower 's replacement by 1832 . On July 7 , 1838 , Congress appropriated an additional $ 2,500.00 to add to the other $ 5,000.00 appropriated for the new lighthouse . The contract for the lighthouse was awarded to Jonathan Scranton , Volney Pierce , and John Wilcox of Madison , Connecticut , on August 18 , 1838 . A new 65-foot ( 20 m ) octagonal brownstone tower was constructed in 1838 and lit in 1839 . The walls of the base of the light are 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) thick , tapering to 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) at the top . The lighthouse is painted white and has six windows , all facing the water . The lighthouse has been described as being \" similar to the masonry towers built earlier , ( New London Harbor Light , New Haven Harbor ( Five Mile Point ) Light , and Faulkner 's Island Light ) , but Lynde Point is considered to represent the finest work of the three \" . The wooden staircase was likely replaced in an 1868 renovation of the light . In 1886 , the Saybrook Breakwater Light was built . Lynde Point then became commonly known as the \" Saybrook Inner Light \" and Saybrook Breakwater became known as the \" Saybrook Outer Light \" . The keeper 's house from 1833 had a frame kitchen addition that connected to the lighthouse , but it was replaced in 1858 with a Gothic Revival gambrel-roofed wood-frame house . In 1966 , the house was torn down and replaced by a duplex house . In 1852 , a fourth-order Fresnel lens from Barbler and Fenestre replaced the original ten lamps and 9-inch ( 230 mm ) reflectors . In 1890 , a fifth-order Fresnel lens , which is still in the tower today , was installed . An appropriation of $ 800 was made for a fog bell in 1850 , and it was installed in 1854 at a cost of $ 1000 . Two years later the machinery to automatically strike the fog bell was completed . The 1867 renovation saw the addition of a fog siren , but it was removed and replaced with the fog bell in 1874 and a new fog bell was later installed in 1883 . Lynde Point Lighthouse used whale oil until 1879 when it switched to kerosene , it was electrified in 1955 and fully automated by the United States Coast Guard in 1978 . = = Importance = = In 1990 , it was added to the National Register of Historic Places . Templeton writes , \" Lynde Point exhibits superior stone work in the tapering brownstone walls . Of the three early masonry Lighttowers in the nominated group , Lynde Point is the latest and its construction is the best documented : two advertisements for construction proposals survive , containing the government 's specifications , and the construction contract as well . Lynde Point also is significant as part of the federal government 's early efforts to improve aids to navigation in Long Island Sound , when the mouths of important harbors and rivers were among the first sites chosen for lighthouse appropriations . \" Lynde Point is an active aid to navigation and is not open to the public . The Lynde Point Light was used in the 2005 horror movie Predator Island . = = List of keepers = = This list includes known keepers , but excludes assistants and non-officers of the Coast Guard .",

Constructed between 1671 and 1673 , it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction . It is the second largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world . It is Lahore 's most iconic and famous landmark and a major tourist attraction . Aurangzeb 's mosque 's architectural plan is similar to that of his father , Shah Jehan , the Jama Masjid in Delhi ; though it is much larger. it also functions as an idgah . The courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet , can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers ; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque . The minarets are 196 feet ( 60 m ) tall . The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures , but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh .

He built the mosque between 1671 and 1673 under the guidance of Fidai Khan Koka , his \" master of ordinance \" . On 7 July 1799 , the Sikh army of the Sukerchakia chief , Ranjit Singh , took control of Lahore . After the capture of the city , the Badshahi mosque was desecrated by Ranjit Singh , who used its vast courtyard as a stable for his army horses , and its 80 hujras ( small study rooms surrounding the courtyard ) as quarters for his soldiers and as magazines for military stores . Ranjit Singh used the Hazuri Bagh , the enclosed garden next to it , as his official royal court of audience . In 1818 , he built a marble edifice in the garden facing the mosque . In 1841 , during the First Anglo-Sikh War , Ranjit Singh 's son , Sher Singh , used the mosque 's large minarets for placement of zamburahs or light guns . It was used to bombard the supporters of Chand Kaur taking refuge in the besieged Lahore Fort , inflicting great damage to the fort itself . In one of these bombardments , the fort 's Diwan-e-Aam ( Hall of Public Audience ) was destroyed ( it was subsequently rebuilt by the British but it could not be exactly restored in the previous state ) . During this time , Henri De la Rouche , a French cavalry officer employed in the army of Sher Singh , used a tunnel connecting the Badshahi mosque to the Lahore fort to temporarily store gunpowder . In 1849 during the British Raj , the British continued using the mosque and the adjoining fort as a military garrison . The 80 cells ( hujras ) built into the walls surrounding the its vast courtyard on three sides were originally study rooms , which were used by the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh to house troops and military stores . The British demolished them so as to prevent them from being used for anti-British activities and rebuilt them to form open arcades or dalans . = = = 1849 \u2013 1947 = = = Because of increasing Muslim resentment against the use of the mosque as a military garrison , the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship . From then onwards , piecemeal repairs were carried out under the supervision of the Badshahi Mosque Authority . Extensive repairs commenced from 1939 onwards , when Sikandar Hayat Khan took on the task of raising funds for this purpose . It was not until 1852 that the British established the Badshahi Mosque Authority to oversee the restoration of the mosque as a place of worship . Although repairs were carried out , it was not until 1939 that extensive repairs began , supervised by the architect Nawab Zen Yar Jang Bahadur . The repairs continued until 1960 and were completed at a cost of 4.8 million rupees . = = = Post-independence = = = On the occasion of the 2nd Islamic Summit held at Lahore on 22 February 1974 , thirty-nine heads of Muslim states offered their Friday prayers in the Badshahi Mosque , including , among others , Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan , Faisal of Saudi Arabia , Muammar Gaddafi of Libya , Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait . The prayers were led by Mawl\u0101n\u0101 Abdul Qadir Azad , the then khatib of the mosque . Between 1939 and 1960 , the mosque was repaired to bring it back to its original condition . In 1993 , the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site . In 2000 , the marble inlay in the main prayer hall was repaired . In 2008 , replacement work on the red sandstone tiles on the mosque 's large courtyard commenced , using red sandstone especially imported from the original source near Jaipur , India , bringing it to be nearly restored . = = Features = = The mosque 's full name \" Masjid Abul Zafar Muhy-ud-Din Mohammad Alamgir Badshah Ghazi \" is written in calligraphy on marble above the entrance gate . The architectural plan of the mosque is similar to that of Jama Masjid , built by Aurangzeb 's father Shah Jahan in Delhi . It combines the functions of both a mosque and an idgah . On the eastern side of the mosque is the entrance stairway which leads through a vaulted entrance constructed of red sandstone . The courtyard measures 276,000 square feet and is enclosed by single-aisled arcades . At each of the four corners of the mosque , there is an octagonal , three storeyed minar of red sandstone which has an open , marble-covered canopy . The courtyard is framed by four smaller minarets . The prayer chamber has a central arched niche with five arches on either side which is about one third the size of the central niche . The largest dome is behind the central arch and on its two sides there are two bulbous marble domes . Besides the mosque has symmetry as well as balanced clarity and proportions . The minarets are 196 feet tall with an outer circumference of 67 feet and the inner circumference is eight and half feet . The mosque is built on a raised platform , which is reached by a flight of 22 steps . Though the rooms above the entrance gate are not open to the public , it is believed that it contains Muhammad 's and his son-in-law Ali 's hairs . The main prayer chamber is divided into seven chambers by engraved arches . On the top of the middle , there are three domes , one main and two minor which is a common feature of Mughal architecture . The courtyard is made up of brownstone slabs . The interior of the mosque is adorned with precious and semi-precious stones in floral design . The three chambers on each side of the main chamber contains rooms which are used for teaching purpose . The mosque can accommodate 10,000 worshippers in the prayer hall and 1,00,000 worshippers in the courtyard . The courtyard is the largest amongst other mosques in the world .",
                "St Mary 's Church , Bodewryd = St Mary 's Church , Bodewryd is a small medieval church in the hamlet of Bodewryd , in Anglesey , north Wales . The date of construction is unknown , but there was a church on this site in 1254 and the earliest feature to which a date can be given is a doorway in a 15th-century style dating to around 1500 . When the church was restored in 1867 after being struck by lightning , stained glass with Islamic-influenced patterns was included in the windows , a requirement of Lord Stanley of Alderley , the church 's benefactor , who was a convert to Islam . The church is used for worship by the Church in Wales , and is one of five churches in a combined parish . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is a \" simple , rural church of Medieval origins . \" = = History and location = = The date of foundation of the first religious building on this site is unknown . A church was recorded here in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 , and the church was owned by the Augustinian priory at Penmon , at the south-eastern corner of Anglesey , during the 13th century ; the priory also owned ( and therefore received the tithes from ) the Anglesey churches of Llanddona and St Cwyllog , Llangwyllog at this time . The current building has medieval walls , and the doorway of the porch on the north side of the church , which is of 15th-century style , is the oldest dateable part of the building . A 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales put the date for the doorway at c.1500. St Mary 's was restored in 1867 by Henry Kennedy , the architect of the Diocese of Bangor , after the previous church was struck by lightning . It was funded by Lord Stanley of Alderley , a convert to Islam , whose donations to rural churches carried the requirement that Islamic detail should be included in any restoration work . At St Mary 's , the windows have geometric patterns of small panes of coloured glass as a result . This condition was also imposed by him for the restoration work at the nearby church of St Peirio , Rhosbeirio ( now closed ) , where the new windows were also decorated with geometric patterns in glass . For many years , the church was associated with the Wynn ( or Wynne ) family of Bodewryd . They had an estate at Bodewryd from 1521 until 1755 , when Edward Wynne ( Chancellor of the Diocese of Hereford from 1707 to 1754 ) died without male heirs . His uncle , Humphrey Humphreys ( who was Bishop of Bangor and then Bishop of Hereford ) , was married in St Mary 's in 1690 ; the bishop 's sister had married into the Wynne family in 1672 . The church is by the side of the road in Bodewryd , in the north of Anglesey , about 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) from the town of Amlwch . It is surrounded by a rectangular churchyard , entered through a wooden gate . It is still in use for worship , belonging to the Church in Wales , and is part of the combined parish of Llanfechell with Bodewryd with Rhosbeirio with Llanfflewin and Llanbadrig . It is within the deanery of Twrcelyn , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the rector is the Reverend Canon G W Edwards . The church was used at one time as a chapel of ease for St Eilian 's Church , Llaneilian . = = Architecture and fittings = = The rectangular church , which has been described as \" tiny \" , is said by the Diocese of Bangor to be the second-smallest church in Anglesey . The nave and chancel ( which are not divided ) measure together 34 feet 9 inches by 14 feet ( about 10.6 m by 4.3 m ) . The church is constructed of rubble masonry , dressed with freestone and with a foundation of boulders . The roof , which has a bellcote at the west end , is made of slate ; the roof timbers can be seen from inside . The only bell , which is dated 1747 , is decorated with a vine scroll . The door to the church is on the north side through a porch ; the doorway to the porch has a rounded head and a 15th-century style doorjamb , but the porch itself is more modern . The windows in the nave ( one in the north wall , one in the west wall and two in the south wall ) have rounded tops . The window at the east end of the church , which dates from the late 16th century , is rectangular with three arched lights ( vertical sections ) set in a square frame . The lights are separated by mullions and there is an external hoodmould above the window . There are two fonts : one , which may be medieval in origin , is a gritstone bowl of rectangular shape ; the other , which may have been added during the 19th-century restoration , is an oval alabaster bowl , with rich decoration . The south wall of the chancel has a brass tablet to mark money received from Queen Anne 's Bounty in 1720 and Robert Wynn , rector of Llantrisant , Anglesey , in 1727 . There are various memorials on the interior walls . Edward Wynne ( who is buried in the churchyard ) , his siblings and parents are commemorated by various brass tablets . The 1937 survey of the church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire claims that seven generations of Wynne 's male ancestors were buried in the church , beginning with Rees ap Llewelyn in 1500 . The survey also recorded that the church possessed a silver cup from about 1641 donated by Wynne , a silver cup and paten donated by his sister Ellin in 1703 , and part of an oak table top with a Latin inscription and the date 1611 . = = Assessment = = The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 and has been listed as \" a simple , rural church of Medieval origins \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) notes that it \" retains Medieval fabric but is largely of 19th-century character \" , describing it as a \" simple vernacular building . \" The 19th-century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church as a \" small ancient edifice \" . She noted the memorials to the Wynnes as well as a tablet marking Edward Wynne 's \" munificence \" : she recorded that he had donated 121 acres ( 49 ha ) in 1722 and a rent charge of \u00a3 2 to endow the living , and that \u00a3 800 was also received from Queen Anne 's Bounty . A 2006 guide to the churches of the county describes it as \" one of the smallest churches in Anglesey \" , and says that it stood \" in a pleasant location . \"",
                "United States National Bank Building = The United States National Bank Building is a building located in downtown Portland , Oregon , that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Designed by famed Portland architect A. E. Doyle in a Roman classical style , the four-story building 's first section , facing Sixth Avenue , was completed and opened in 1917 . An extension westward to Broadway , approximately doubling its size , was constructed in 1925 . Since then the building has occupied one-half of a city block . It features a four-story-high colonnade of Corinthian order columns at its eastern end , originally the principal fa\u00e7ade , and extensive use of glazed terracotta . The interior is also decorated extensively with highly textured materials . The building was constructed for the United States National Bank of Portland ( USNB ) , which ultimately became part of U.S. Bancorp , whose retail banking division operates as U.S. Bank . In 2016 , almost 100 years after the building 's opening , it continues to serve as the bank 's main Portland branch . = = History = = The United States National Bank of Portland , the predecessor of present-day U.S. Bancorp , was established in Portland in 1890 , opening for business in February 1891 . During the following three decades , the bank experienced significant growth . It weathered the Panic of 1893 better than many of its competitors , and later acquired some of the competing Portland banks , including the Ainsworth National Bank ( in 1902 ) , the Wells Fargo Bank ( in 1905 ) , and the Lumbermen 's National Bank ( in 1917 ) . With the 1902 acquisition , U.S. National Bank moved its headquarters into a larger space formerly occupied by Ainsworth National , in the Ainsworth Building , then located at S.W. Third and Stark streets in downtown Portland . By the 1910s , the bank had outgrown its space . The firm purchased a quarter-block of land at the northwest corner of Sixth and Stark streets in early 1916 and hired Portland architect A. E. Doyle to design a new , dedicated headquarters building . Construction began in 1916 and was completed in 1917 ; the building opened to the public on July 30 , 1917 . Although the building now extends a full block along Stark Street , with entrances on both 6th Avenue and Broadway , it originally faced only 6th Street ( now 6th Avenue ) and extended only about halfway to Broadway . In 1922 ( another source says 1920 ) , the bank purchased the building that had occupied the quarter-block immediately to the west from the Elks organization which would allow the 1917 bank building to be expanded west to Broadway . ( The Elks were preparing to move to a new building elsewhere in downtown . ) Originally , a new 24-story building was planned for the site , but the bank ultimately decided to expand its existing building , keeping the same design and height for the new section . Shortly after demolition of the old Elks Building in early 1924 , construction of the bank building 's expansion began . The new section opened in 1925 , doubling the building 's size and adding an entrance on Broadway . Doyle was hired again to oversee the expansion , which helped to ensure that that new section would replicate the style of the original section as much as possible , making the expanded building look as though it were built as a single structure , rather than in two stages separated by eight years . In the same year , U.S. National Bank of Portland acquired the Ladd & Tilton Bank , which had been established in 1859 , and was the first financial institution in the Pacific Northwest . This acquisition made USNB \" the largest financial institution north of San Francisco and west of Minneapolis \" . In 1946 , U.S. National purchased the Wells Fargo Building ( since 1922 known as the Porter Building ) , a multistory office building located directly adjacent , immediately to the north , to expand its downtown Portland headquarters . United States National Bank of Portland changed its name to United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964 . By 1970 , the bank was operating 119 branches . At that time , it announced plans for another major expansion of its headquarters on property it had acquired diagonally across from the Wells Fargo Building . The entire oversize block , bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues , and Oak and Burnside Streets , had been acquired , its existing buildings to be razed and replaced by new U.S. National Bank buildings . The first of these was a seven-story building ( the U.S. Bank Plaza , at 5th & Oak ) , completed in 1974 . But the headline structure was the U.S. Bancorp Tower , a 42-story building that opened in 1983 ( having already been part of the bank 's long-term site plans in 1970 , but ultimately delayed until the 1980s ) . Notwithstanding this major expansion , the firm continued to own and use its landmark 1917 building , which company president LeRoy Staver , in a 1970 Oregonian article , called \" a jewel of a banking property and one that will never be duplicated \" . In a 1979 article , The Oregonian wrote that , \" The 1917-vintage U.S. National Bank , 321 S.W. Sixth Avenue , retains nearly all its original features , inside and out , a rare trait among Portland landmarks . \" The U.S. National Bank of Oregon was honored by the Portland Historical Landmarks Commission in that year for its longstanding commitment to maintaining the building in nearly original condition . The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 , and was still serving as the bank 's main branch . Since the end of 1968 , United States National Bank of Oregon has been owned by the then-newly formed holding company U.S. Bancorp , which provides consumer banking under the U.S. Bank name . Almost 100 years after its opening , the 1917-built , 1925-expanded original United States National Bank Building continues to serve as the main branch of U.S. Bank in Portland in 2016 . = = Description = = = = = Exterior = = = The building is five stories tall including a mezzanine level and , after its 1925 expansion , occupies a 100-by-200-foot ( 30 m \u00d7 61 m ) area , along the north side of SW Stark Street from Sixth Avenue to Broadway . The eastern fa\u00e7ade , facing Sixth Avenue , features six freestanding Corinthian columns , each 54 ft ( 16 m ) in height . These support a portico that is topped by a large and richly decorated Roman frieze , a cornice and balustrade . Decorations on the cornice include lion heads and palmettes . At the back of the portico , and behind the columns , are two Corinthian pilasters , at the far left and right ends of the fa\u00e7ade . Between these are \" five vertical bays separated by piers made of coursed , rusticated terra cotta . Window openings are set in cast-bronze frames . \" The five windows at the second-floor level are topped by cast-bronze segmental pediments . There are three entrance doorways in the three central bays , although originally there was only one . The central entrance features a pair of large bronze doors with highly decorated bas relief panels , surrounded by detailed terracotta , including a heraldic eagle in a pedimented cornice above the doorway . The bronze relief panels were cast in 1931 , replacing the 1917 door panels which had used replicas of early Greek , Roman and U.S. coins as a design motif . Designed by Avard Fairbanks , they \" depict noble concepts of American life , such as ' Knowledge and Service ' , ' Domestic Welfare ' , ' Progress through Direction ' , and so on . \" Fairbanks also designed bronze relief panels for the building 's western fa\u00e7ade , built in 1925 . The overall exterior design was modeled closely on a 1904 bank building , the headquarters of the Knickerbocker Trust Company , in New York City . The southern fa\u00e7ade , along Stark Street , is 200 ft ( 61 m ) long and features a line of 14 Corinthian pilasters . The 12 window bays on this side have frames made of cast iron . Above the pilasters and fourth-floor windows are a cornice and balustrade with a design similar to that used at the eastern end . The Stark Street side includes one entrance , which was present from 1917 , located at what was then the far back corner of the building , but its position became approximately midway along the Stark Street side following the 1925 expansion . At the building 's west end , constructed eight years later and facing Broadway , the fa\u00e7ade is similar to the eastern one , but the main body of the building extends to the corners of the lot , and instead of a full-width portico there is a recessed portico with only two columns in the center . Six pilasters line the eastern fa\u00e7ade , three to each side of the columns , all topped by Corinthian capitals , the same as on the building 's other two exposed sides . Another difference from the eastern fa\u00e7ade is that , on the western fa\u00e7ade , \" United States National Bank \" is inscribed in the central section of the frieze , in place of the rinceau decoration there at the building 's opposite end . Ornamental bronze lanterns flank the central entrance , which features bas relief panels cast in bronze in 1926 \u2013 27 and designed by Avard Fairbanks . The panels at the western entrance \" depict pivotal events in the historical development of the Columbia Basin \" . = = = Interior = = = The ground floor holds the main banking room ( the Portland branch of U.S. Bank ) , and a grand room measuring 100 by 40 feet ( 30 m \u00d7 12 m ) with 30-foot ( 9 m ) ceilings . The interior is extensively decorated with highly textured materials . Square columns of polished marble topped by Corinthian capitals that incorporate an eagle motif line all four sides of the main public space . The coffered ceiling is intricately detailed . The marble floor is patterned , and the teller windows are divided by Hauteville-marble pillars detailed with bas reliefs . A recessed mezzanine floor runs along the north and south sides , behind the columns . The bank vaults are in the basement , where the public space also has a marble floor . The third and fourth floors are office space , centered around a courtyard . A remodeling of the fourth-floor offices in 1948 , based on designs by Pietro Belluschi , incorporated Oregon myrtle in the paneling and custom furnishings . The bank 's board room , located on the third floor , includes a marble fireplace and stained glass windows by the noted Portland company , Povey Brothers Studio . The room is 55 ft \u00d7 30 ft ( 16.8 m \u00d7 9.1 m ) . Its walls are covered in dark walnut . Ornamental lighting fixtures with brass wall mountings adorn the east and west ends of the room , and a bronze ring chandelier hangs above the center . = = Immediate surroundings = = At its east end , the United States National Bank Building stands directly across 6th Avenue from another A. E. Doyle-designed bank building , the Bank of California Building , of 1925 . The aforementioned building 's Italianate style contrasts sharply with the U.S. National Bank Building 's classical design . The northbound Portland Transit Mall passes in front of the building 's east end , and during the mall 's construction in 1976 \u2013 77 the plain concrete sidewalk there was resurfaced in brick , and street trees were added .

The first church in this location is said to have been established by St Deiniol Fab ( to whom the church is dedicated ) in 616 . He was the son of St Deiniol , the first Bishop of Bangor . The current building , which is in Early English style , incorporates some material and fittings from an earlier church on the site , including the font and an 18th-century memorial in the porch . The vestry door has medieval jambs and the keystone of its arch , which is also medieval , is a carved human face . Some parts of the nave walls may also come from a previous building here . The church is no longer used for worship , and the village is now served by a church in Llanfairpwll . As of 2011 , the building ( without the surrounding grounds ) was for sale . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is regarded as \" a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church \" . = = History and location = = St Deiniol 's Church is near the centre of Llanddaniel Fab , a village in the south of Anglesey , north Wales . It is reached from the street by passing through a lychgate by the local war memorial . The village takes its name from the church ; the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , and -ddaniel is a modified form of the saint 's name . The date of first construction of a Christian place of worship in the area is uncertain , but it is said by 19th-century writers that a son of St Deiniol ( the first Bishop of Bangor ) established a church here in 616 . The son , also a saint , was known as Deiniol Fab ( Welsh for \" Deiniol the son \" ) , to distinguish him from his father . No part of a building from that time survives . A later edifice , dating from the 16th century or perhaps earlier , was replaced in the 19th century . Some parts of that structure may have been reused in the current church , as the 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire considered that sections of the walls of the nave may be from the older building . In 1833 , the antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the old church as \" a very ancient and dilapidated structure \" , which had \" some good specimens of the architecture of a very remote period \" . Writing in 1846 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones described it as one \" so much altered by successive reparations , that little of its original architectural character has been preserved \" . Repairs were carried out to the new church , and a vestry added to the north side , in 1873 . The work was overseen by Henry Kennedy , architect of the Diocese of Bangor . St Deiniol 's is no longer in use ; in 2006 , a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that no services had been held for a number of years , and added that ivy was growing across the building . The church 's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of Llanfairpwll , served by St Mary 's , Llanfairpwll . As of January 2011 , the church ( without the grounds ) was on sale for \u00a3 50,000 ; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that it could be used as a studio or for storage , subject to necessary consents being obtained . People associated with St Deiniol 's include the clergymen Henry Rowlands and Isaac Jones . Rowlands , who wrote a history of Anglesey ( Mona Antiqua Restaurata ) in 1723 , served as priest here and in nearby parishes from 1696 onwards . Jones , a translator , was curate of St Deiniol 's from 1840 until his death in 1850 . = = Architecture and fittings = = The Gothic Revival church is in the Early English style . It is built from rubble masonry dressed with limestone and has a slate roof . The vestry is partially built from material used in the old church . The door in the vestry 's north wall has medieval doorjambs , and the keystone of the pointed arch , which is also medieval , is a carved human face . The nave of the church ( where the congregation sat ) has no aisle . The chancel ( site of the altar ) is at the east end of the nave . There is a porch , which contains an 18th-century memorial , on the south side of the nave towards the west end , and a vestry to the north . Each section is steeply gabled , with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell . The windows in the nave have two lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) , save for one to the west of the porch , which has one light . The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows , the tallest in the middle . Internally , the walls have panelling at the bottom and painted plasterwork above . The roof has exposed timbers . There is a pointed chancel arch and three steps between the nave and chancel , with a further step to the sanctuary , which has a mosaic floor . The east windows and those on the north have stained glass . Fittings include the rectangular pulpit , the pews , and the altar table , which are all made of pine wood , and the octagonal font , made of granite with carvings on each side . The 1937 Royal Commission survey recorded that the church owned a plain silver cup , dated 1796 \u2013 1797 . A visual inspection of the church in 2006 determined that there were many cobwebs inside , but also that the pews and organ remained in place . = = Assessment = = St Deiniol 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is regarded as \" a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) states that it is \" coherently designed in an early Gothic style which is apt for its scale \" .",

It is generally regarded as the most famous shootout in the history of the American Wild West . The gunfight took place at about 3 : 00 p.m. on Wednesday , October 26 , 1881 , in Tombstone , Arizona Territory . It was the result of a long-simmering feud , with Cowboys Billy Claiborne , Ike and Billy Clanton , Tom and Frank McLaury on one side and town Marshal Virgil Earp , Special Policeman Morgan Earp , Special Policeman Wyatt Earp and temporary policeman Doc Holliday on the other side . Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed . Ike Clanton , who had repeatedly threatened to kill the Earps , claimed he was unarmed and ran from the fight , along with Billy Claiborne . Virgil , Morgan , and Doc Holliday were wounded , but Wyatt Earp was unharmed . The fight has come to represent a period in American Old West when the frontier was virtually an open range for outlaws , largely unopposed by law enforcement officers , who were spread thin over vast territories , leaving some areas unprotected . The gunfight was not well known to the American public until 1931 , when Stuart Lake published an initially well-received biography , Wyatt Earp : Frontier Marshal , two years after Earp 's death . The book was the basis for the 1946 film My Darling Clementine , directed by John Ford , and the 1957 film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral , after which the shootout became known by that name . Since then , the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books . Despite its name , the historic gunfight did not take place within or next to the O.K. Corral , which fronted on Allen Street and had a rear entrance lined with stalls on Fremont Street . The shootout actually took place in a narrow lot on the side of C. S. Fly 's Photographic Studio on Fremont Street , six doors west of the O.K. Corral 's rear entrance . Some members of the two opposing parties were initially only about 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) apart . About 30 shots were fired in 30 seconds . Ike Clanton , whose brother Billy had been killed , filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday . The lawmen were eventually exonerated by a local justice of the peace after a 30-day preliminary hearing and then by a local grand jury . The gunfight was not the end of the conflict . On December 28 , 1881 , Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in a murder attempt by outlaw Cowboys . On March 18 , 1882 , Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the glass door of a saloon and shot Morgan Earp , killing him . The suspects in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted . Wyatt Earp , newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County , took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta . He was pursued by county Sheriff Johnny Behan , who had received a Tucson warrant for Wyatt 's shooting of Frank Stilwell . = = Background to the conflict = = Tombstone , near the Mexican border , was formally founded in March 1879 ; it was a rapidly growing frontier mining boomtown . The Earps arrived on December 1 , 1879 , when the small town was mostly composed of tents as living quarters , a few saloons and other buildings , and the mines . Virgil Earp had been hired as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County , with his offices in Tombstone , only days before his arrival . In June 1881 he was also appointed as Tombstone 's town marshal ( or police chief ) . Though not universally liked by the townspeople , the Earps tended to protect the interests of the town 's business owners and residents , although Wyatt Earp helped protect Cowboy Curly Bill Brocius from being lynched after he accidentally killed Tombstone city Marshal Fred White . In contrast , Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan was generally sympathetic to the interests of the rural ranchers and Cowboys . In that time and region , the term cowboy generally meant an outlaw . Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers . = = Conflicting versions of events = = Many of the supporting facts about the events leading up to the gunfight and details of the gunfight itself are uncertain . Newspapers of the day were not above taking sides , and news reporting often editorialized on issues to reflect the publisher 's interests . John Clum , publisher of The Tombstone Epitaph , had helped organize a \" Committee of Safety \" ( a vigilance committee ) in Tombstone in late September 1881 . He was elected as the city 's first mayor under the new city charter of 1881 . Clum and his newspaper tended to side with the interests of local business owners and supported Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp . Harry Woods , the publisher of the other major newspaper , the The Daily Nugget , was an undersheriff to Behan . He and his newspaper tended to side with Behan , the Cowboys ( some of whom were part-time ranchers and landowners ) , and the rural interests of the ranchers . Much of what is known of the event is based on a month-long preliminary hearing held afterward , generally known as the Spicer hearings . Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony at the coroner 's inquest and the Spicer hearings , but only the reporter from The Daily Nugget knew shorthand . The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly . According to the Earps ' version of events , the fight was in self-defense because the Cowboys , armed in violation of local ordinance , aggressively threatened the lawmen , defying a lawful order to hand over their weapons . The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands , offering no resistance , and were shot in cold blood by the Earps . Sorting out who was telling the truth then was difficult and remains so . Though usually opposing each other in their reporting of events , reporting by both the Epitaph and the Nugget initially supported the lawmen 's version of events . Woods , the publisher of the pro-Cowboy Nugget , was out of town during the hearings , and an experienced reporter , Richard Rule , wrote the story . The Nugget staff had a close relationship with Sheriff Behan , but Rule 's story , as printed in the Nugget the day after the shootout , backed up the Earps ' version of events . This varied widely from Behan 's and the Cowboys ' later court testimony . Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan 's and the Cowboys ' view of events . Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nugget 's later view entirely and supported the lawmen . In addition , the autopsies of the deceased Cowboys indicated that none of them were shot with their hands up , as the Clantons had claimed . Part-time newspaper reporter Howell \" Pat \" Hayhurst transcribed the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s as part of a federal Federal Writers ' Project , part of the Works Progress Administration . According to one report , Hayhurst was a friend of the Behan family . After he completed his transcription , he kept the original document in his home , where it was destroyed in a house fire . = = Origins of the conflict = = = = = Earps versus Cowboys = = = The interpersonal conflicts and feuds leading to the gunfight were complex . Each side had strong family ties . The brothers James , Virgil , Wyatt , Morgan , and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family , working together as pimps , lawmen , and saloon owners in several Western towns , among other occupations , and had moved together from one town to another . Virgil served in the Union Army during the Civil War and in 1877 became a police officer in Prescott , Arizona . He followed that with a job as night watchman before he became a constable . Wyatt had held two jobs as a police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City , Kansas . James , Virgil and Wyatt Earp , together with their wives , arrived in Tombstone on December 1 , 1879 , during the early period of rapid growth associated with mining , when there were only a few hundred residents . Virgil had been appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal for the Tombstone area shortly before they arrived . In the summer of 1880 , Morgan and Warren Earp also moved to Tombstone . Wyatt arrived hoping he could leave \" lawing \" behind . He bought a stagecoach , only to find the business was already very competitive . The Earps invested together in several mining claims and water rights . The Earps were Republicans and Northerners who had never worked as cowmen or ranchers . The Earps came into conflict with Cowboys Frank and Tom McLaury , Billy and Ike Clanton , Johnny Ringo , and Curly Bill Brocius , among others . They were part of a large , loose association of cattle smugglers and horse thieves known as the Cowboys , outlaws who had been implicated in various crimes . Ike Clanton was prone to drinking heavily and threatened the Earp brothers numerous times . Tombstone resident George Parson wrote in his diary , \" A Cowboy is a rustler at times , and a rustler is a synonym for desperado \u2014 bandit , outlaw , and horse thief . \" The San Francisco Examiner wrote in an editorial , \" Cowboys [ are ] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country ... infinitely worse than the ordinary robber . \" At that time during the 1880s in Cochise County it was an insult to call a legitimate cattleman a \" Cowboy . \" Legal cowmen were generally called herders or ranchers . The Cowboys teamed up for various crimes and came to each other 's aid . Virgil Earp thought that some of the Cowboys had met at Charleston , Arizona , and taken \" an oath over blood drawn from the arm of Johnny Ringo , the leader , that they would kill us.' = = = The Earps as lawmen = = = Virgil Earp had been appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County by U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake before the Earps arrived in Tombstone on December 1 , 1879 . Virgil ran for the office of Tombstone 's city marshal ( or police chief ) in November 1880 but lost to Ben Sippy . Sippy left town in June 1881 , and Virgil was appointed to replace him . At the time of the gunfight and afterward , until he was wounded on December 29 , 1881 , Virgil was both Deputy U.S. Marshal and town marshal . The city suspended him as town marshal after Ike Clanton filed murder charges . With his business efforts yielding little profit , Wyatt Earp became a stagecoach shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo , guarding shipments of silver bullion , until he was appointed Pima County Deputy Sheriff on July 28 , 1880 . He held this position for only three months until after the election of November 9 , 1880 , when he resigned . While Wyatt was Pima County Deputy Sheriff , Morgan Earp took over his job as shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo . The job as Pima County Sheriff was the only job Wyatt held as a lawman in Arizona , except for occasions when Virgil temporarily appointed him to be a deputy town marshal , including the week prior to the gunfight . Morgan also occasionally assisted Virgil and at the time of the gunfight was wearing a deputy city marshal 's badge and drawing pay . When Virgil was maimed by an assassination attempt , Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in his place . He held that position until he left Cochise County in April 1882 . The Earps ' work as lawmen was not welcomed by the outlaw Cowboys , who viewed the Earps as badge-toting tyrants who ruthlessly enforced the business interests of the town . In direct conflict with the Earps ' roles as lawmen , Johnny Behan was Cochise County Sheriff . Wyatt Earp was an imposing , handsome man : blond , 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) tall , weighing about 165 to 170 pounds ( 75 to 77 kg ) , was broad-shouldered , long-armed , and muscular . He had been a boxer and was reputed to be an expert with a pistol . According to author Leo Silva , Earp showed no fear of any man . Earp had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense , hard-nosed lawman , but prior to the gunfight in October 1881 , he had been involved in only one prior shooting in Dodge City , Kansas during the summer of 1878 . Wyatt was an assistant marshal and with policeman James Masterson , along with a few other citizens , fired their pistols at several Cowboys who were fleeing town after shooting up a theater . A member of the group , George Hoyt ( sometimes spelled Hoy ) , was shot in the arm and died of his wound a month later . Wyatt always claimed to have been the one to shoot Hoyt , although it could have been anyone among the lawmen . The 1931 book Wyatt Earp : Frontier Marshal was a best-selling biography by Stuart N. Lake . It established Wyatt Earp 's role as a fearless lawman in the American Old West and the \" Gunfight at the O.K. Corral \" in the public consciousness . But Lake wildly exaggerated Wyatt 's role in the gun battle . He and many others in the popular media have embellished Wyatt 's role as the central figure in the gunfight . It was only discovered much later that Wyatt Earp : Frontier Marshal , based on a eight interviews with Earp , was largely fictional . The book and later Hollywood portrayals exaggerated Wyatt 's reputation and magnified his mystique as a western lawman . Among the lawmen involved in the O.K. Corral shooting , only Virgil had any real experience in combat , and he had far more experience than any of his brothers as a sheriff , constable , and marshal . Virgil served for three years during the Civil War and had also been involved in a police shooting in Prescott , Arizona Territory . Morgan Earp had no known experience with gunfighting prior to this fight , although he frequently hired out as a shotgun messenger . Doc Holliday had a reputation as a gunman and had reportedly been in nine shootouts during his life , although it has only been verified that he killed three men . One well-documented episode occurred on July 19 , 1879 , when Holliday and his business partner , former deputy marshal John Joshua Webb , were seated in their saloon in Las Vegas , New Mexico . Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon got into a loud argument with one of the saloon girls that he wanted to take with him . Gordon stormed from the saloon and began firing his revolver into the building . Before Gordon could get off his second shot , Holliday killed him . Holliday was tried for the murder but acquitted , mostly based on the testimony of Webb . Holliday had saved Wyatt Earp 's life at one time and had become a close friend . He had been living in Prescott , Arizona Territory and making a living as a gambler since late 1879 . There , he first met future Tombstone sheriff Johnny Behan , a sometime gambler and saloon owner . In late September 1880 , Holliday followed the Earps to Tombstone . = = = Rural Cowboys vs. Tombstone interests = = = The ranch owned by Newman Haynes Clanton near Charleston , Arizona was believed to be the local center for the Cowboys ' illegal activities . Tom and Frank McLaury worked with the rustlers buying and selling stolen cattle . Many of the rural ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing influence of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement . The ranchers largely maintained control of the country outside Tombstone , due in large part to the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan , who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers , and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps . Behan tended to ignore the Earps ' complaints about the McLaurys ' and Clantons ' horse thieving and cattle rustling . As officers of the law , the Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests , which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction . = = = Tombstone , a boomtown = = = After silver was discovered in the area , Tombstone grew rapidly . At its founding in March 1879 , it had a population of just 100 , and only two years later , in late 1881 , it had more than 7,000 citizens , excluding Chinese , Mexicans , women and children . Tombstone was the largest boomtown in the Southwest . Silver mining and its attendant wealth attracted many professionals and merchants , who brought their wives and families . With them came churches and ministers . They brought a Victorian sensibility and became the town 's elite . By 1881 there were fancy restaurants , a bowling alley , four churches , an ice house , a school , an opera house , two banks , three newspapers , and an ice cream parlor , along with 110 saloons , 14 gambling halls , and numerous brothels , all situated among a number of dirty , hardscrabble mines . Horse rustlers and bandits from the countryside came to town , and shootings were frequent . In the 1880s , illegal smuggling and theft of cattle , alcohol , and tobacco across the Mexico \u2013 United States border , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) from Tombstone , were common . The Mexican government assessed heavy export taxes on these items , and smugglers earned a handsome profit by stealing them in Mexico and smuggling them across the border . = = = Relevant law in Tombstone = = = To reduce crime in Tombstone , on April 19 , 1881 , the city council passed ordinance 9 , requiring anyone carrying a bowie knife , dirk , pistol or rifle to deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town . The ordinance was the legal basis for City Marshal Virgil Earp 's decision to confront the Cowboys , which resulted in the shoot-out . = = = Smuggling and stock thefts = = = In that border area there was only one passable route between Arizona and Mexico , a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon . In August 1881 , 15 Mexicans carrying gold , coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon . The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border , and they killed five Cowboys , including Old Man Clanton , in Guadalupe Canyon . The Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon . Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout , \" I naturally kept my eyes open and did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if I could help it . \" = = = Earp loses sheriff 's office to Behan = = = On July 27 , 1880 , Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell , whose offices were in the county seat of Tucson , appointed Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff . On October 28 , 1880 , Tombstone Town Marshal Fred White attempted to disarm some late-night revelers who were shooting their pistols in the air . When he attempted to disarm Curly Bill Brocius , the gun discharged , striking White in the abdomen . Wyatt saw the shooting and pistol-whipped Brocius , knocking him unconscious , and arrested him . Wyatt later told his biographer John Flood that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time , and didn 't see Brocius ' pistol on the ground . Brocius waived the preliminary hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson . Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon the next day to Tucson to stand trial , possibly saving him from being lynched . Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental . It was also demonstrated that Brocius ' pistol could be fired from half-cock . Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional . Based on the evidence presented , Brocius was not charged with White 's death . The Tombstone council convened and appointed Virgil Earp as \" temporary assistant city marshal \" to replace White for a salary of $ 100 per month until an election could be held on November 12 . For the next few weeks , Virgil represented federal and local law enforcement and Wyatt represented Pima County . In the November 2 , 1880 election for Pima County sheriff , Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul , who was expected to win . Votes arrived as late as November 7 , and Shibell was unexpectedly reelected . He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County , a job that Wyatt wanted . A controversy ensued when Paul uncovered ballot-stuffing by Cowboys and he sued to overturn the election . Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881 , but it was too late to reappoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on January 1 , 1881 , the eastern portion of Pima County containing Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County , which would need its own sheriff , based in the county 's largest city , Tombstone . This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor , and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job . The Cochise County sheriff 's position was worth more than $ 40,000 a year ( about $ 980,828 today ) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector , and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid . Behan utilized his existing position and his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position . He also promised Wyatt a position as his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt . Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise County sheriff on February 10 , 1881 . Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead . Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan 's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton . = = Earp conflicts with Cowboys = = Tensions between the Earp family and both the Clanton and McLaury clans increased through 1881 . = = = Stolen mules tracked to McLaury 's ranch = = = On July 25 , 1880 , Captain Joseph H. Hurst , of Company A , 12th Infantry , and Commanding Officer of Fort Bennett , asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to help him track Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker . This was a federal matter because the animals were U.S. property . Hurst brought four soldiers , and Virgil invited Wyatt and Morgan Earp , as well as Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams . The posse found the mules on the McLaury 's Ranch on the Babacomari Creek , north west of Tombstone , and the branding iron used to change the \" US \" brand to \" D8 \" . To avoid bloodshed , Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst they would return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw . Hurst went to nearby Charleston , but the Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules , laughing at Hurst and the Earps . In response , Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules . He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30 , 1880 . Virgil later said that McLaury had asked him if he had posted the handbills . When Virgil said he had not , McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank 's intention to kill Virgil . He warned Virgil , \" If you ever again follow us as close as you did , then you will have to fight anyway . \" This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps . = = = March stagecoach robbery and murder = = = On the evening of March 15 , 1881 , a Kinnear & Company stagecoach carrying US $ 26,000 in silver bullion ( about $ 637,538 in today 's dollars ) was en route from Tombstone to Benson , Arizona , the nearest freight terminal . Bob Paul , who had run for Pima County Sheriff and was contesting the election he lost due to ballot-stuffing , was temporarily working once again as the Wells Fargo shotgun messenger . He had taken the reins and driver 's seat in Contention City because the usual driver , a well-known and popular man named Eli \" Budd \" Philpot , was ill . Philpot was riding shotgun . Near Drew 's Station , just outside Contention City , a man stepped into the road and commanded them to \" Hold ! \" Three Cowboys attempted to rob the stage . Paul , in the driver 's seat , fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers , wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin . Philpot , riding shotgun , and passenger Peter Roerig , riding in the rear dickey seat , were both shot and killed . The horses spooked and Paul wasn 't able to bring the stage under control for almost a mile , leaving the robbers with nothing . Paul said he thought the first shot killing Philpot in the shotgun messenger seat had been meant for him because he would normally have been seated there . = = = = Suspects identified = = = = Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp , along with temporary federal deputies Wyatt and Morgan Earp , Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams , former Kansas Sheriff Bat Masterson ( who was dealing faro at the Oriental Saloon ) , and County Sheriff Behan set out to find the robbers . Wells Fargo issued a wanted poster offering a US $ 3,600 ( $ 1,200 per robber ) reward for capture of the robbers , dead or alive . Robbery of a mail-carrying stagecoach was both a federal crime and territorial crime , and the posse consisted of both county and federal authorities and deputies . The posse trailed the robbers to a nearby ranch where they found a drifter named Luther King . He wouldn 't tell who his confederates were until the posse lied and told him that Doc Holliday 's girlfriend had been shot . Fearful of Holliday 's reputation , he confessed to holding the reins of the robbers ' horses , and identified Bill Leonard , Harry \" The Kid \" Head and Jim Crane as the robbers . They were all known Cowboys and rustlers . Behan and Williams escorted King back to Tombstone . = = = = Suspect escapes Behan 's jail = = = = Somehow King walked in the front door of the jail and a few minutes later out the back . King had arranged with Undersheriff Harry Woods ( publisher of the Nugget ) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar , Sheriff Behan 's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable . On March 19 , King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale . Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail . The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King 's easy escape . Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo , leaving behind a number of debts , when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years . = = = = Earp pursues suspects = = = = The Earps pursued the other two men for 17 days , riding for 60 hours without food and 36 hours without water , during which Bob Paul 's horse died , and Wyatt and Morgan 's horses became so weak , that the two men walked 18 miles ( 29 km ) back to Tombstone to obtain new horses . After pursuing the Cowboys for over 400 miles ( 640 km ) they could not obtain more fresh horses and were forced to give up the chase . They returned to Tombstone on April 1 . Behan submitted a bill for $ 796.84 to the county for posse expenses , but he refused to reimburse the Earps for any of their costs . Virgil was incensed . They were finally reimbursed by Wells , Fargo & Co. later on , but the incident caused further friction between county and federal law enforcement , and between Behan and the Earps . = = = = Wyatt offers Ike reward money = = = = After he was passed over by Johnny Behan for the position of undersheriff , Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882 . He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff 's office . Wyatt later said that on June 2 , 1881 he offered the Wells , Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers . According to Wyatt , Ike was initially interested , but the plan was foiled when the three suspects \u2014 Leonard , Head and Crane \u2014 were killed in unrelated incidents . Ike began to fear that word of his possible cooperation had leaked , threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys . Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal , and said something to Ike , who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross . Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday ( who had learned of the deal ) for apparently revealing Ike 's willingness to help arrest his friends . = = = = Earp , Cowboy fallout = = = = The fallout over the Cowboys ' attempt to implicate Holliday and the Earps in the robbery , along with Behan 's involvement in King 's escape , was the beginning of increasingly bad feelings between the Earp brothers and Cowboy factions . = = = Earp and Behan attracted to Josephine Marcus = = = Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were interested in the same sheriff 's position and also may have shared an interest in the same woman , Josephine Marcus , known as Sadie . Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Marcus were married , but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women . Marcus ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out , although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer . She rented her home sometime before April 1881 , to Dr. George Goodfellow . Wyatt Earp was still living with his common-law wife , Mattie Blaylock , who was listed as his wife in the 1880 census , but she had a growing addiction to the opiate laudanum . There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Marcus and Earp , but Earp certainly knew her , because both Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon . Sadie , traveling as either Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp , left for Los Angeles on March 25 , 1882 , and then returned to her family in San Francisco . In July 1882 , Wyatt left Colorado and went to San Francisco , where he sought out Sadie and his brother Virgil , who was seeking treatment for his arm . In February or March 1883 , Sadie and Earp left San Francisco for Gunnison , where Earp ran a Faro bank until he received a request in April for assistance from Luke Short in Dodge City . Sadie was his common-law wife for the next 46 years . = = = September stage holdup = = = Tensions between the Earps and the McLaurys further increased when another passenger stage on the ' Sandy Bob Line ' in the Tombstone area , bound for Bisbee , was held up on September 8 , 1881 . The masked bandits robbed all of the passengers of their valuables since the stage was not carrying a strongbox . During the robbery , the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as \" sugar \" , a phrase known to be used by Frank Stilwell . Stilwell had until the prior month been a deputy for Sheriff Behan but had been fired for \" accounting irregularities \" . Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with a sheriff 's posse and tracked the Bisbee stage robbers . Virgil had been appointed Tombstone 's town marshal ( i.e. , chief of police ) on June 6 , 1881 , after Ben Sippy abandoned the job . However , Virgil at the same time continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal , and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits . At the scene of the holdup , Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel . The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell . = = = = Stilwell and Spence arrests = = = = Frank Stilwell had just arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner , Pete Spence , when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup . Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys . At the preliminary hearing , Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis . Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just as he had done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year . Released on bail , Spence and Stilwell were re-arrested October 13 by Marshal Virgil Earp for the Bisbee robbery on a new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier . The newspapers , however , reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred on October 8 near Contention City . Ike and other Cowboys believed the new arrest was further evidence that the Earps were illegally persecuting the Cowboys . They told the Earps that they could expect retaliation . While Virgil and Wyatt were in Tucson for the federal hearing on the charges against Spence and Stilwell , Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp . He told him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence , Stilwell , or the McLaurys again . The Tombstone Epitaph reported \" that since the arrest of Spence and Stilwell , veiled threats [ are ] being made that the friends of the accused will ' get the Earps . ' \" = = = = Cowboys accuse Holliday of robbery = = = = Milt Joyce , a county supervisor and owner of the Oriental Saloon , had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday . In October 1880 , Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce 's Oriental Saloon . Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from the Oriental Saloon . Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight , but Tyler ran . Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday . Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday 's revolver . But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver . Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday , but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm , disarming him , and then shot Joyce 's business partner William Parker in the big toe . Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his revolver . Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery . Holliday and his on-again , off-again mistress Big Nose Kate had many fights . After a particularly nasty , drunken argument , Holliday kicked her out . County Sheriff John Behan and Milt Joyce saw an opportunity and exploited the situation . They plied Big Nose Kate with more booze and suggested to her a way to get even with Holliday . She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in the attempted stagecoach robbery and murders . Holliday was a good friend of Bill Leonard , a former watchmaker from New York , one of three men implicated in the robbery . Judge Wells Spicer issued an arrest warrant for Holliday . The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday 's location at the time of the murders and Kate sobered up , revealing that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she didn 't understand . With the Cowboy plot revealed , Spicer freed Holliday . The district attorney threw out the charges , labeling them \" ridiculous . \" Doc gave Kate some money and put her on a stage out of town . = = = Ike Clanton 's conflict with Doc Holliday = = = Wyatt Earp testified after the gunfight that five or six weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel . Ike told Wyatt that Doc Holliday had told him he knew of Ike 's meetings with Wyatt and about Ike providing information on Head , Leonard , and Crane , as well as their attempted robbery of the stage . Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about these conversations . Earp testified that he told Ike he had not told Holliday anything . Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town . A month later , the weekend before the shootout , Morgan Earp , concerned about possible trouble with the Cowboys , brought Doc Holliday back from a fiesta celebration in Tucson where Holliday had been gambling . Upon his return , Wyatt Earp asked Holliday about Ike 's accusation . On the morning of Tuesday , October 25 , 1881 , the day before the gunfight , Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury drove 10 miles ( 16 km ) in a spring wagon from Chandler 's Milk Ranch at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains to Tombstone . They were in town to sell a large number of beef stock , most of them owned by the McLaurys . Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight , Holliday confronted Ike , accusing him of lying about their previous conversations . They got into a heated argument . Wyatt Earp ( who was not wearing a badge ) encouraged his brother , Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp , to intervene . Morgan escorted Holliday out onto the street and Ike , who had been drinking steadily , followed them . City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing . Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later , and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning . Ike told Earp that the fighting talk had been going on for a long time and that he intended to put an end to it . Ike told Earp , \" I will be ready for you in the morning . \" Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him . Ike sat down to have another drink , his revolver in plain sight , and told Earp \" You must not think I won 't be after you all in the morning . \" = = Morning of the shoot-out = = = = = Events leading up to the Ike Clanton court hearing = = = After Holliday 's confrontation with Ike Clanton , Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his room at Camillus Sidney \" Buck \" Fly 's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking , then went home and to bed . Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp played cards with Ike Clanton , Tom McLaury , Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan and a fifth man ( unknown to Ike and to history ) , until morning . At about dawn on October 26 , the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed . Ike Clanton testified later he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended . Not having rented a room , Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton had no place to go . Shortly after 8 : 00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the telegraph office . Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep , but Ike insisted he would not go to bed . Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him . Boyle later said that Ike told him , \" ' As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street , the ball would open \u2014 that they would have to fight ' ... I went down to Wyatt Earp 's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open . \" Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day . Later in the morning , Ike picked up his rifle and revolver from the West End Corral , where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town . By noon that day , Ike was still drinking and once-again armed in violation of the city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city . He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp . At about 1 : 00 pm , Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol-whipped him from behind . Disarming him , the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance . Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held . = = = Ike Clanton court hearing = = = While Wyatt waited for Virgil to return with Judge Wallace , witnesses overheard Wyatt tell Clanton , \" you cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch , and you know that I know you are a cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch , you 've threatened my life enough , and you 've got to fight ! \" , and Ike Clanton made the remark , \" Fight is my racket , and all I want is four feet of ground ! \" Ike reported in his testimony afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him . He said Wyatt , Virgil and Morgan offered him his rifle and to fight him right there in the courthouse , which Ike declined . Ike also denied ever threatening the Earps . Ike was fined $ 25 plus court costs and after paying the fine left unarmed . Virgil told Ike he would leave Ike 's confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel which was favored by Cowboys when in town . Ike testified that he picked up the weapons from William Soule , the jailer , a couple of days later . = = = Tom McLaury 's concealed weapon = = = Outside the court house where Ike was being fined , Wyatt almost walked into 28 year-old Tom McLaury as the two men were brought up short nose-to-nose . Tom , who had arrived in town the day before , was required by the well-known city ordinance to deposit his pistol when he first arrived in town . When Wyatt demanded , \" Are you heeled or not ? \" , McLaury said he was not armed . Wyatt testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom 's pants . As an unpaid deputy marshal for Virgil , Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband , as was the custom of that time . Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and pistol whipped Tom McLaury with it twice , leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street . Saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan testified at the Spicer hearing afterward that he saw McLaury deposit a revolver at the Capital Saloon sometime between 1-2 : 00 pm , after the confrontation with Wyatt , which Mehan also witnessed . Wyatt said in his deposition afterward that he had been temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial . Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal , which Virgil later confirmed . Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer , he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits- \u2014 a misdemeanor offense . Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies , including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp , could search him and take any required action . Wyatt , a non-drinker , testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys . At the time of the gunfight about two hours later , Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed . It was early afternoon by the time Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds . The day was chilly , with snow still on the ground in some places . Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling , drinking heavily , and without sleep . Now they were both out-of-doors , both wounded from head beatings , and at least Ike was still drunk . = = = More Cowboys enter town = = = At around 1 : 30 \u2013 2 : 00 pm , after Tom had been pistol-whipped by Wyatt , Ike 's 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom 's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town . They had heard from their neighbor , Ed \" old man \" Frink , that Ike had been stirring up trouble in town overnight , and they had ridden into town on horseback to back up their brothers . They arrived from Antelope Springs , 13 miles ( 21 km ) east of Tombstone , where they had been rounding up stock with their brothers and had breakfasted with Ike and Tom the day before . Both Frank and Billy were armed with a revolver and a rifle , as was the custom for riders in the country outside Tombstone . Apache warriors had engaged the U.S. Army near Tombstone just three weeks before the O.K. Corral gunfight , so the need for weapons outside of town was well established and accepted . Billy and Frank stopped first at the Grand Hotel on Allen Street , and were greeted by Doc Holliday . They learned immediately after of their brothers ' beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours . The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town . Angrily , Frank said he would not drink , and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom . By law , both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel . Instead , they remained fully armed . = = = Virgil and Wyatt Earp \u2019 s reactions = = = Wyatt said that he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger 's gun and hardware store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges . Ike testified afterward that Tom was not there and that he had tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike 's bandaged head and refused to sell him one . Ike apparently had not heard Virgil tell him that his confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel around the corner from Spangenberger 's shop . When Virgil Earp learned that Wyatt was talking to the Cowboys at Spangenberg 's gun shop , he went there himself . Virgil testified afterward that he thought he saw all four men , Ike Clanton , Billy Clanton , Frank McLaury , and Tom McLaury , buying cartridges . Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office , where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge , short , double-barreled shotgun . It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone , and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat . To avoid alarming Tombstone 's public , Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford 's Saloon . From Spangenberg 's , the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps . For unknown reasons the Cowboys then walked out the back of the O.K. Corral and then west , stopping in a narrow , empty lot next to C. S. Fly 's boarding house . Virgil initially avoided a confrontation with the newly arrived Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton , who had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable as the law required . The statute was not specific about how far a recently arrived visitor might \" with good faith , and within reasonable time \" travel into town while carrying a firearm . This permitted a traveler to keep his firearms if he was proceeding directly to a livery , hotel or saloon . The three main Tombstone corrals were all west of 4th street between Allen and Fremont , a block or two from where Wyatt saw the Cowboys buying cartridges . Miner Ruben F. Coleman later told The Tombstone Epitaph : I was in the O.K. Corral at 2 : 30 p.m. when I saw the two Clantons and the two McLaurys in an earnest conversation across the street at Dunbar \u2019 s corral . I went up the street and notified Sheriff Behan and told them it was my opinion that they meant trouble , and it was his duty , as sheriff , to go and disarm them . I told him they had gone to the West End Corral . I then went and saw Marshal Virgil Earp and notified him to the same effect . = = = Behan attempts to disarm Cowboys = = = Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan , a friend of the Cowboys , later testified that he woke up about 1 : 30 pm after the late-night card game , and went to get a shave at a barbershop . That 's where he first learned that the Cowboys were armed . Behan stated he quickly finished his shave and went to locate the Cowboys . At about 2 : 30 pm he found Frank McLaury holding a horse and talking to someone on Fourth Street near the corner of Fremont . When he saw Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury near C. S. Fly 's photography studio , he walked there with Frank . He told the Cowboys that they must give up their arms . Ike Clanton said he was not armed , and Tom McLaury pulled his coat open to show he was not carrying a weapon . The Cowboys were located in a narrow 15 \u2013 20 feet ( 4.6 \u2013 6.1 m ) lot between the Harwood house and Fly 's 12-room boarding house and photography studio at 312 Fremont Street , where Doc Holliday roomed . Behan later said he attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons , but Frank insisted that he would only give up his guns after City Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers were first disarmed . The Cowboys were about a block and a half from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont , where Ike and Tom 's wagon and team were stabled . Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th , from which he thought they would be departing if they were leaving town . While Ike Clanton later said he was planning to leave town , Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business . Will McLaury , Tom and Frank 's brother and a judge in Fort Worth , Texas , claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shoot out that Tom and Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas . He wrote that Billy Clanton , who had arrived on horseback with Frank , intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth . Will McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers ' murder . Paul Johnson told a different story , that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister , Sarah Caroline , in Iowa . Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah , one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings . Caroline married James Reed in Richland , Iowa at the end of November that year . = = = Virgil decides to disarm Cowboys = = = Citizens reported to Virgil on the Cowboys ' movements and their threats told him that Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed , in violation of the city ordinance . Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street . Virgil decided he had to disarm the Cowboys . His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboy 's repeated threats to the Earps , their proximity to Holliday 's room in Fly 's boarding house , and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street . Several members of the citizen 's vigilance committee offered to support him with arms , but Virgil said no . He had during the prior month appointed Morgan as a Special Policeman . He had also appointed Wyatt as a Special Policemen while Virgil had been in Prescott on business . He had also called on Doc Holliday that morning for help with disarming the Clantons and McLaurys . Wyatt spoke of his brothers Virgil and Morgan as the \" marshals \" while he acted as \" deputy . \" Virgil Earp picked up the short , double-barreled shotgun he had retrieved from the Wells Fargo office earlier . He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat . He took Holliday 's walking-stick in return . As usual , the Earps carried their revolvers in their coat pockets or in their waistbands . Wyatt Earp was carrying a .44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver . Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster , but this was concealed by his long coat , as was the shotgun . The Earps and Holliday walked west , down the south side of Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral , but out of visual range of the Cowboys ' last reported location . Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St. , the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan . He had left the Cowboys and came toward them , though he looked nervously backward several times . Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them , \" For God 's sake , don 't go down there or they will murder you ! \" Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan , \" I have disarmed them . \" Behan testified afterward that he 'd only said he 'd gone down to the Cowboys \" for the purpose of disarming them , \" not that he 'd actually disarmed them . When Behan said he had disarmed them , Virgil attempted to avoid a fight . \" I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants , and when he said he had disarmed them , I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand . \" Wyatt said I \" took my pistol , which I had in my hand , under my coat , and put it in my overcoat pocket . \" The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot . Wyatt testified he saw \" Frank McLaury , Tom McLaury , and Billy Clanton standing in a row against the east side of the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of Fly 's photograph gallery . Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don 't know [ Wes Fuller ] were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west . \" Addie Bourland corroborated Wyatt 's testimony , stating that she saw \" five men opposite my house , leaning against a small house west of Fly 's Gallery and one man was holding a horse , standing a little out from the house . \" = = The gunfight = = In the preceding weeks and hours , Ike Clanton had repeatedly threatened Doc Holliday and the Earps . The Earps were tired of the threats . Martha J. King was in Bauer 's butcher shop on Fremont Street . She testified that when the Earp party passed by her location , one of the Earps on the outside of the group looked across and said to Doc Holliday nearest the store , \" ... let them have it ! \" to which Holliday replied , \" All right . \" = = = Physical proximity = = = When the Earps approached the lot , the four law men were initially facing five Cowboys : Frank McLaury , Tom McLaury , Billy Clanton , Wes Fuller , and Ike Clanton . The Cowboys stepped away from the Harwood house . In testimony given by witnesses afterward , they disagreed about the precise location of the men and animals at the beginning of the gunfight and during . The coroner 's inquest and the Spicer hearing produced a sketch showing the Cowboys standing , from left to right facing Fremont Street , with Billy Clanton and then Frank McLaury near the Harwood house and Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton roughly in the middle of the lot . Opposite them and initially only about 6 to 10 feet ( 1.8 to 3.0 m ) away , Virgil Earp was on the left end of the Earp party , standing a few feet inside the vacant lot and nearest Ike Clanton . Behind him a few feet near the corner of C. S. Fly 's boarding house was Wyatt . Morgan Earp was standing on Fremont Street to Wyatt 's right , and Doc Holliday anchored the end of their line in Fremont Street , a few feet to Morgan 's right . Wyatt Earp drew a sketch in 1924 and another with John Flood on September 15 , 1926 that depicted Billy Clanton near the middle of the lot , close to the Harwood house . Tom and Frank McLaury stood deeper in the lot . Frank was in the center between the two buildings , holding the reins of his horse . Tom was closer to C. S. Fly 's boarding house . According to Wyatt 's sketches , Morgan was on the right of the lawmen , close to the Harwood house , opposite Billy Clanton near the Harwood house and close to Fremont St. Virgil was deeper in the lot , opposite Frank and Ike Clanton . Wyatt was to Virgil 's left , opposite Tom . Doc Holliday hung back a step or two on Fremont Street . Neither of Wyatt 's sketches included Ike Clanton or Billy Clairborne , who ran from the fight . = = = Gunbattle begins = = = Virgil Earp was not expecting a fight . Once Behan said that he 'd disarmed the Cowboys , Virgil traded the short , double-barreled shotgun he was carrying for Holliday 's cane . Virgil carried the cane in his right hand and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left . Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket . Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put his pistol in his overcoat pocket . Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury wore revolvers in holsters on their belts and stood alongside their saddled horses with rifles in their scabbards , possibly in violation of the city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town . When Virgil saw the Cowboys , he testified , he immediately commanded the Cowboys to \" Throw up your hands , I want your guns ! \" Wyatt said Virgil told the Cowboys , \" Throw up your hands ; I have come to disarm you ! \" Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their six-shooters . Virgil yelled : \" Hold ! I don 't mean that ! \" or \" Hold on , I don 't want that ! \" The single-action revolvers carried by both groups had to be cocked before firing . Jeff Morey , who served as the historical consultant on the film Tombstone , compared testimony by partisan and neutral witnesses and came to the conclusion that the Earps described the situation accurately . Who started shooting first is not certain ; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory . The smoke from the black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space . Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories , and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first . The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds . First two shots Virgil Earp reported afterward , \" Two shots went off right together . Billy Clanton 's was one of them . \" Wyatt testified , \" Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me , but I did not aim at him . I knew that Frank McLaury had the reputation of being a good shot and a dangerous man , and I aimed at Frank McLaury . \" He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers : \" The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself , he shooting at me , and I shooting at Frank McLaury . \" Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first . Clanton missed , but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach . All witnesses generally agreed that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other . General firing immediately broke out . Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed . When shooting started , the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side . Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw his hand to his right hip . Virgil said Tom followed the horse 's movement , hiding behind it , and fired once , if not twice , over the horse 's back . Holliday shoots Tom According to one witness , Holliday drew a \" large bronze pistol \" ( interpreted by some as Virgil 's coach gun ) from under his long coat , stepped around Tom McLaury 's horse , and shot him with the short , double-barreled shotgun in the chest at close range . Witness C. H. \" Ham \" Light saw Tom running or stumbling westward on Fremont Street towards Third Street , away from the gunfight , while Frank and Billy were still standing and shooting . Light testified that Tom fell at the foot of a telegraph pole on the corner of Fremont and 3rd Street and lay there , without moving , through the duration of the fight . After shooting Tom , Holliday tossed the shotgun aside , pulled out his nickel-plated revolver , and continued to fire at Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton . Ike Clanton runs Wyatt told the court afterward that Ike Clanton had bragged that he would kill the Earps or Doc Holliday at his first opportunity . But when the gunfight broke out , Clanton ran forward and grabbed him , exclaiming that he was unarmed and did not want a fight . To this protest Wyatt said he responded , \" Go to fighting or get away ! \" Clanton ran through the front door of Fly 's boarding house and escaped , unwounded . Other accounts say that Ike drew a hidden pistol and fired at the Earps before disappearing . Billy Claiborne also ran from the fight . Billy Clanton shot According to The Tombstone Epitaph , \" Wyatt Earp stood up and fired in rapid succession , as cool as a cucumber , and was not hit . \" Morgan Earp fired almost immediately , as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed . Morgan 's shot hit Billy in the right wrist , disabling his hand . Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand , Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun . Virgil and Wyatt were now firing . Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground . Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen , and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street . He tried and failed to grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse . Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead . Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street , and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket , grazing him . Holliday followed him , exclaiming , \" That son of a bitch has shot me and I am going to kill him . \" Morgan Earp picked himself up and also fired at Frank . Frank fell to the sidewalk on the east side of Fremont Street . A number of witnesses observed a man leading a horse into the street and firing near it and Wyatt in his testimony thought this was Tom McLaury . Claiborne said only one man had a horse in the fight , and that this man was Frank , holding his own horse by the reins , then losing it and its cover , in the middle of the street . Wes Fuller also identified Frank as the man in the street leading the horse . Morgan Earp wounded Though wounded , Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury kept shooting . One of them , perhaps Billy , shot Morgan Earp across the back in a wound that struck both shoulder blades and a vertebra . Morgan went down for a minute before picking himself up . Either Frank or Billy shot Virgil Earp in the calf ( Virgil thought it was Billy ) . Virgil , though hit , fired his next shot at Billy Clanton . Frank , now entirely across Fremont street and still walking at a good pace according to Claiborne 's testimony , fired twice more before he was shot in the head under his right ear . Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had fired the shot that killed Frank , but since neither of them testified at the hearing , this information is only from second-hand accounts . A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank , and saw Frank try to speak , but he died where he fell , before he could be moved . Billy Clanton was shot in the wrist , chest and abdomen , and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting position near his original position at the corner of the MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly 's Lodging House . Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot , and fired some shots after sitting , with the pistol supported on his leg . After he ran out of ammunition , he called for more cartridges , but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended . A few moments later , Tom McLaury was carried from the corner of Fremont and Third into the Harwood house on that corner , where he died without speaking . Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house , where Tom had been taken . Billy was in considerable pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine . He told those near him , \" They have murdered me . I have been murdered . Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air . \" Billy gasped for air , and someone else heard him say , \" Go away and let me die . \" Ike Clanton , who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death , was still running . William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Tough Nut Street . = = Outcome of the battle = = Ike Clanton , who had been threatening to kill the Earps for several months , including the day before , and Billy Claiborne were both unarmed . They ran from the fight unhurt . Wesley Fuller , a Cowboy who had been at the rear of the lot , left as soon as the firing began . Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse . Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen . During the gunfight , Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip . Virgil Earp was shot through the calf , he thought by Billy Clanton . Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired . Wyatt Earp was unhurt . Tom McLaury , his brother Frank , and Billy Clanton were killed . As the wounded lawmen were carried to their homes , they passed in front of the Sheriff 's Office , and Johnny Behan told Wyatt Earp he was under arrest . Wyatt paused two or three seconds and replied very forcibly : \" I won 't be arrested today . I am right here and am not going away . \" Dr. George Goodfellow treated the Earps ' wounds . = = = Cowboy wounds = = = Dr. Henry M. Mathews examined the dead Cowboys late that night . He found Frank McLaury had two wounds : a gunshot beneath the right ear that horizontally penetrated his head , and a second entering his abdomen one inch to the left of his navel . Mathews stated that the wound beneath the ear was at the base of the brain and caused instant death . Sheriff Behan testified that he had heard Morgan Earp yell \" I got him \" after Frank was shot . However , during the gunfight , Frank moved across Fremont street , putting Holliday on Frank 's right and Morgan on his left . This makes it much more likely that Holliday shot the fatal round that killed Frank . When he examined Tom McLaury 's body , Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds from a single shotgun round on the right side under his arm , between the third and fifth ribs . The wound was about four inches across . The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom 's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified . Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom , which the coroner 's exam supported . Dr. George Goodfellow testified about Billy Clanton 's wounds at the Spicer hearing . He stated that the angle of the wrist wound indicated that Billy 's hand could not have been raised over his head as claimed by Cowboy witnesses . In his coroner 's report , Mathews did not mention Billy 's arm wound , but witness Keefe , who examined the arm closely , testified later that Clanton was shot through the right arm , close to the wrist joint and \" the bullet passed through the arm from \" inside to outside , \" entering the arm close to the base of the thumb , and exiting \" on the back of the wrist diagonally \" with the latter wound larger . This indicated to the judge that Billy could not have been holding his coat 's lapels open , his arms raised , as the Cowboys testified . Dr. Mathews found two other wounds on Billy 's body . The first was two inches from Clanton 's left nipple , penetrated his lung . The other was in the abdomen beneath the twelfth rib , six inches to the right of the navel . Both were fired from the front . Neither passed completely through his body . The wound to Billy Clanton 's right wrist may have been inflicted by Morgan Earp or Doc Holliday immediately at the outset of the fight as Billy was drawing his gun . = = = Weapons carried by the Cowboys = = = Billy Clanton Billy Clanton was armed with Colt Frontier 1873 revolvers which were identified by their serial numbers at the Spicer hearing . C.S. Fly found Billy Clanton 's empty revolver in his hand where he lay and took it from him . Frank McLaury Frank McLaury 's was also armed with a Colt Frontier 1873 revolver which was recovered by laundryman B. E. Fellehy on the street a few feet from his body with two rounds remaining in it . Fellehy placed it next to Frank 's body before he was moved to the Harwood house . Dr. Mathews laid Frank 's revolver on the floor while he examined Billy and Tom . Cowboy witness Wes Fuller said he saw Frank in the middle of the street shooting a revolver and trying to remove a Winchester rifle from the scabbard on his horse . The two Model 1873 rifles were still in the scabbards on Frank and Tom McLaury 's horses when they were found after the gunfight . If , as was customary , Frank carried only five rounds , then he had fired only three shots . Tom McLaury Witnesses differed about whether Tom McLaury was carrying a weapon during the shootout or not . No revolver or rifle was found near his body and he was not wearing a cartridge belt . Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance . He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined . Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight , between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man . Behan testified that when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight , he was not thorough , and that Tom might have had a pistol hidden in his waistband . Behan 's testimony was significant , since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point . Behan 's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known , and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs . However , documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing . Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff , Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt . A story in the Cowboy-friendly newspaper , the Nugget , stated without attribution that \" The Sheriff stepped out and said [ to the Earps ] : ' Hold up boys , don 't go down there or there will be trouble ; I have been down there to disarm them . ' \" In his testimony , Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys , not that he had actually done so . The article said that Behan \" was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it . \" Given the Nugget 's close relationship to Behan ( it was owned by Behan 's deputy sheriff ) , it is likely they interviewed him . By Williams ' account , Behan told Virgil Earp immediately after the gunfight a story that corroborated the Nugget report , which the newspaper altered afterward to a version that matched the story Behan later told at the coroner 's inquest . Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan had seen Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp and before the gunfight , none of the Earps had any way of knowing that Tom had left his revolver at the saloon . Hotel keeper Albert \" Chris \" Billickie , whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel , saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer 's butcher shop about 2 : 00 p.m. He testified that Tom 's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded , as if it contained a pistol ( so he thought ) , when he emerged . Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom 's pants . However , the bulge in Tom 's pants pocket may have been the nearly $ 3,300 in cash and receipts found on his body , perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher . Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday believed that Tom had a revolver at the time of the gunfight . Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse 's neck and believed until he died that Tom 's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller . One eye witness , laundryman Peter H. Fellehy , stated that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself , and once shot the man fell . During that statement , Fellehy claimed the man still held his pistol in his hand . Although he never said he saw him shoot , he does indicate that Tom McLaury was armed . Ruben F. Coleman also said afterward that he thought Tom was armed , though he later equivocated on this point . He was quoted in the October 27 issue of The Tombstone Epitaph in which he said , \" Tom McLaury fell first , but raised and fired again before he died . \" Coleman also testified at the coroner \u2019 s inquest one day later . Part-time newspaper reporter Howell ' Pat ' Hayhurst transcribed all of the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s as part of the Federal Writers ' Project , in the Works Progress Administration . When he transcribed Coleman 's second testimony , he quoted Coleman as saying , \" Tom McLaury , after the first two shots were fired , ran down Fremont Street and fell ... I think that the report I gave to the Epitaph was pretty near correct as published . \" However , it 's known that Hayhurst arbitrarily removed text that he decided was not relevant . Author Stuart N. Lake later said Hayhurst \u2018 mutilated \u2019 the transcription . The documents were subsequently lost and are still unaccounted for . Even if Tom wasn 't armed with a revolver , Virgil Earp testified Tom attempted to grab a rifle from the scabbard on the horse in front of him before he was killed . Judge Spicer ruled afterward that \" if Thomas McLaury was one of a party who were thus armed and were making felonious resistance to an arrest , and in the melee that followed was shot , the fact of his being unarmed , if it be a fact , could not of itself [ in ] criminate the defendants [ Earps ] , if they were not otherwise criminated . \" [ sic ] Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne both said they were unarmed when they fled the gunfight . = = Public reaction = = The bodies of the three dead Cowboys were displayed in a window at Ritter and Reams undertakers with a sign : \" Murdered in the Streets of Tombstone . \" The Daily Nugget proclaimed : The 26th of October , 1881 , will always be marked as one of the crimson days in the annals of Tombstone , a day when blood flowed as water , and human life was held as a shuttle cock , a day to be remembered as witnessing the bloodiest and deadliest street fight that has ever occurred in this place , or probably in the Territory . The Tombstone Epitaph was more restrained in its language : The feeling among the best class of our citizens is that the Marshal was entirely justified in his efforts to disarm these men , and that being fired upon they had to defend themselves which they did most bravely . Since The Tombstone Epitaph was the local Associated Press client , its story was the version of events that most readers across the United States read first . The funerals for Billy Clanton ( age 19 ) , Tom McLaury ( age 28 ) and his older brother Frank ( age 33 ) were well attended . About 300 people joined in the procession to Boot Hill and as many as two thousand watched from the sidewalks . Both McLaureys were buried in the same grave , and Billy Clanton was buried nearby . The story was widely printed in newspapers across the United States . Most versions favored the lawmen . The San Francisco Exchange headlines their story , \" A Good Riddance \" . The Coroner 's Jury convened by Dr. Henry Matthews neither condemned nor exonerated the lawmen for shooting the Cowboys . \" William Clanton , Frank and Thomas McLaury , came to their deaths in the town of Tombstone on October 26 , 1881 , from the effects of pistol and gunshot wounds inflicted by Virgil Earp , Morgan Earp , Wyatt Earp , and one \u2014 Holliday , commonly called ' Doc Holliday ' . \" The initial public reaction was largely favorable to the Earps , but began to change when rumors began to circulate that Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury were unarmed , and that Billy Clanton and Tom McLaury even threw up their hands before the shooting . Within a few days , Phineas \" Fin \" Clanton arrived in town , and some began to claim that the Earps and Holliday had committed murder , instead of enforcing the law . Clara Spalding Brown , the wife of mining engineer Theodore Brown , was a correspondent for the San Diego Union and other California newspapers . She wrote that Tombstone residents were divided about the justification for the killings . Referring to the initial testimony offered by Ike Clanton , she wrote , \" Opinion is pretty divided as to the justification of the killing . You may meet one man who will support the Earps , and declare that no other course was possible to save their own lives , and the next man is just as likely to assert that there was no occasion whatever for bloodshed , and that this will be ' a warm place ' for the Earps hereafter . At the inquest yesterday , the damaging fact was ascertained that only two of the cowboys were armed , it thus being a most unequal fight . \" Even the Governor of the Arizona Territory , John C. Fr\u00e9mont , reported after the gunfight , \" Many of the very best law-abiding and peace-loving citizens [ of Tombstone ] have no confidence in the willingness of the civil officers to pursue and bring to justice that element of out-lawry so largely disturbing the sense of security ... [ The opinion ] is quite prevalent that the civil officers are quite largely in league with the leaders of this disturbing and dangerous element . \" = = Spicer hearing = = Four days after the shoot out , Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps . Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace , Wells Spicer . Morgan and Virgil were still recovering at home . Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $ 10,000 bail , which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch , local mine owner E.B. Gage , Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge , and other business owners appreciative of the Earps ' efforts to maintain order . Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending the outcome of the trial . Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial . The prosecution was led by Republican District Attorney Lyttleton Price , assisted by John M. Murphy , James Robinson , and Ben Goodrich . They were joined by William McLaury , Frank and Tom 's older brother , he also being an able attorney , who played a key role on the prosecutor 's team . The Earp 's attorney Thomas Fitch was an experienced trial lawyer and had earned a reputation as the \" silver-tongued orator of the Pacific . \" Spicer took written and oral testimony from a number of witnesses over more than a month . Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory . Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first . Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan testified on the third day of the hearing . During two days on the stand , he gave strong testimony that the Cowboys had not resisted but either threw up their hands and turned out their coats to show they were not armed . Behan 's views turned public opinion against the Earps , who were free on bail . He and other prosecution witnesses testified that Tom McLaury was unarmed , that Billy Clanton had his hands in the air , and that neither of the McLaurys were troublemakers . They portrayed Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury as being unjustly bullied and beaten by the vengeful Earps on the day of the gunfight . On the strength of the prosecution case , Spicer revoked the bail for Doc and Wyatt Earp and had them jailed on November 7 . They spent the next 16 days in jail . Defense accounts contradicted the testimony of Behan , Claiborne and Allen , who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first . Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday . Virgil , Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun . ( Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify . ) The prosecution 's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first , switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury , then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing . Three witnesses gave key evidence that swayed Justice Spicer to hold that Virgil had acted within his capacity as Sheriff and that there was insufficient evidence to indict the Earps and Doc Holliday for murder . H.F Sills was an AT & SF RR engineer who had just arrived in town and knew none of the parties involved . He testified that he saw \" the marshal go up and speak to this other party . I ... saw them pull out their revolvers immediately . The marshal had a cane in his right hand at the time . He throwed up his hand and spoke . I did not hear the words though . By that time Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp had fired their guns off . \" Grilled by the prosecution , he corroborated virtually all of the defense 's testimony . Addie Bourland was a dressmaker whose residence was across Fremont Street from Fly 's Boarding House . She testified that she saw both sides facing each other , that none of the Cowboys had held their hands up , that the firing was general , and that she had not seen Billy Clanton fall immediately as the Cowboys had testified . Judge J.H. Lucas of the Cochise County Probate Court had offices in the Mining Exchange Building about 200 feet ( 61 m ) from the shootout . Lucas ' corroborated Addie Bourland 's testimony that Billy Clanton was standing throughout the fight , which contradicted prosecution witnesses who maintained he went down immediately after being shot at close range in the belly . Spicer noted that no powder burns were found on his clothing . These witnesses ' testimony , especially that of H.F. Sills , a disinterested party , discredited much of the testimony given by Sheriff Johnny Behan , Ike Clanton and the other Cowboy witnesses . After hearing all the evidence , Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that Virgil , as the lawman in charge that day , had acted within his office and that there was not enough evidence to indict the men . He described Frank McLaury 's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a \" proposition both monstrous and startling ! \" He noted that the prosecution claimed that the Cowboys ' purpose was to leave town , yet Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne did not have their weapons with them . Spicer noted that the doctor who examined the dead Cowboys established that the wounds they received could not have occurred if their hands and arms had been in the positions that prosecution witnesses described . Spicer did not condone all of the Earps ' actions and criticized Virgil Earp 's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies , but he concluded that no laws were broken . He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil Earp . = = In popular culture = = The public perception of the Earp brothers ' actions , and especially those of Wyatt , were controversial . Even today , they have strongly opinionated admirers and detractors . = = = Gunfight sketch = = = A hand-drawn sketch of the gunfight , made by John Flood with Wyatt Earp 's assistance on September 15 , 1921 , was sold at auction in October 2010 for $ 380,000 . The map describes the position of a number of witnesses and all of the participants with the exception of Ike Clanton , who fled from the gunfight . = = = Paintings = = = In 1952 , Victor Clyde Forsythe , a popular painter of desert scenes and cowboy artist , painted \" Gunfight at O.K. Corral \" , a 43 by 60 inches ( 110 by 150 cm ) oil painting regarded by some as the most accurate depiction of the gunfight for many years . Forsythe \u2019 s father , William Bowen Forsyth and uncle , Ira Chandler owned a store , Chandler & Forsyth C.O.D. , at 328 Fremont Street , west of the back entrance to the O.K. Corral , and one-half block from the site of the gunfight . They claimed that had been present and witnessed the shoot out . Newspaper accounts of the painting reported that Forsythe had interviewed Tombstone residents and examined many of the existing buildings before beginning to plan his painting . In May 1988 , his studio printed and sold a limited edition of 390 copies of the painting . John Gilchriese became friends with John Flood , who had been Wyatt Earp \u2019 s secretary , confidante and best friend for many years . When Earp died , Flood inherited many of his personal belongings . Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese , who amassed over a number of years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp along with many unpublished photos of them and their family . Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral . The oil on masonite painting , titled The Street Fight , is 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet ( 1.93 m by 1.22 m ) . It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval . He referred to original documents in Gilchriese 's collection , including Wyatt Earp 's own diagram of the shootout , and unpublished notes made by John Flood , to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout . Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original , which Perceval signed . The prints were sold by the museum for $ 10 . After Gilchriese closed his museum , the painting along with other contents of the museum was sold at auction by John 's Western Gallery of San Francisco . The estimated auction price was $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 . The final sale price on June 25 , 2004 was $ 40,250 . It was put up for auction again on June 14 , 2014 with an estimated selling price of $ 40,000 - $ 60,000 but failed to sell . = = = Origin of the gunfight 's name = = = The shootout was described by Breakenridge in his 1928 book Helldorado : Bringing Law to the Mesquite as \" The Incident Near the O.K. Corral . \" In his popular book Wyatt Earp : Frontier Marshal , Stuart Lake titled his chapter about the conflict , \" At the O.K. Corral . \" But it was the popular movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral that cemented the incident and its erroneous location in popular consciousness . The movie and accompanying mythologizing also altered the way the public thought of the Earps and the outlaws . Prior to the movie , the media often criticized the Earps ' actions in Tombstone . In the movies , they became the good guys , always ready to stand for what is right . The incident has become a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and the symbolism of the fight between lawmen and the outlaw Cowboys . When the Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan , but escaped prosecution , Wyatt 's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people 's attention . The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist , between a modern nation that was rapidly industrializing , pushing out what had been a largely agrarian economy . The town of Tombstone has capitalized on widespread interest in the gunfight . Portions of the town are a historical district that has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. National Park Service . A local company produces daily theatrical re-enactments of the gunfight . = = = Film and television = = = With the widespread sales of televisions after World War II , producers spun out a large number of western-oriented shows . At the height of their popularity in 1959 , there were more than two dozen \" cowboy \" programs on each week . At least six of them were directly or indirectly connected with Wyatt Earp : The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp , Bat Masterson , Tombstone Territory , Broken Arrow , Johnny Ringo , and Gunsmoke . Hugh O 'Brien portrayed Earp on the namesake show , Wyatt Earp , which ran for six seasons . A 2003 episode of Discovery Channel 's Unsolved History used modern technology to attempt to re-enact the gunfight . They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place . They confirmed that the front to back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm was raised in a manner like that when holding a pistol and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters ' view of each other . The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution ( Sheriff Behan , Ike Clanton and Billy Clanton ) likely offered perjured testimony . They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard , as the horse turned away from him at the same time . The stories about the gunfight written in the 20th century affected American culture . Numerous dramatic , fictional , and documentary works have been produced about or referencing the event with varying degrees of accuracy .

                    "text": "Liverpool Town Hall = Liverpool Town Hall stands in High Street at its junction with Dale Street , Castle Street , and Water Street in Liverpool , Merseyside , England . It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and described in the list as \" one of the finest surviving 18th-century town halls \" . The authors of the Buildings of England series refer to its \" magnificent scale \" , and consider it to be \" probably the grandest ... suite of civic rooms in the country \" , and \" an outstanding and complete example of late Georgian decoration \" . It is not an administrative building but a civic suite , Lord Mayor 's parlour and Council chamber ; local government administration is centred at the nearby Municipal Buildings . The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby . An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785 . Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built . Minor alterations have subsequently been made . The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation , notably when viewed from Castle Street , the south-side , it appears as off-centre . This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street , the west-east axis , was continuous and built up across the junction so that the Town Hall was not visible originally from that aspect . The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position . The ground floor contains the city 's Council Chamber and a Hall of Remembrance for the Liverpool servicemen killed in the First World War . The upper floor consists of a suite of lavishly decorated rooms which are used for a variety of events and functions . Conducted tours of the building are arranged for the general public , and the hall is licensed for weddings . = = History = = The first recorded town hall in Liverpool was in 1515 and it was probably a thatched building . It was replaced in 1673 by a building slightly to the south of the present town hall . This town hall stood on \" pillars and arches of hewen stone \" and under it was the exchange for merchants and traders to carry out their business . Building of the present town hall began in 1749 on a site slightly to the north of its predecessor ; its foundation stone was laid on 14 September . The architect was John Wood the Elder , who has been described as \" one of the outstanding architects of the day \" . It was completed and opened in 1754 . The ground floor acted as the exchange , and a council room and other offices were on the upper floor . The ground floor had a central courtyard surrounded by Doric colonnades but it was \" dark and confined , and the merchants preferred to transact business in the street outside \" . Above the building was a large square dome with a cupola . The Town Hall was bombarded by striking seamen during the 1775 Liverpool Seamen 's Revolt . The very last act of the American Civil War was when Captain Waddell walked up the steps of Town Hall in November 1865 with a letter to present to the mayor surrendering his vessel , the CSS Shenandoah , to the British government . Improvements began in 1785 with an extension to the north designed by James Wyatt . Buildings close to the west and north sides were demolished , and John Foster prepared plans for the west fa\u00e7ade . In 1786 Wood 's square dome was demolished and plans were made by Wyatt for a new dome over the central courtyard . In 1795 , before the new dome was built , the hall was seriously damaged by a fire . Wyatt 's north extension was not significantly damaged , but Wood 's original building was gutted . The building was reconstructed and Wyatt 's new dome was added . The work was supervised by Foster and completed in 1802 . Under the dome the central courtyard was replaced with a hall containing a staircase . In 1811 a portico was added to the south side . The construction and decoration of the interior was completed by about 1820 . In 1881 an attempt to blow up the town hall by the Fenians was aborted . In 1899 \u2013 1900 the portico on the south face was rebuilt and extended , and the northern extension was enlarged to form a recess in the Council Chamber for the Lord Mayor 's chair . In 1921 a room on the ground floor was made into the Hall of Remembrance to commemorate the military men from Liverpool who died in the First World War . Part of the building was damaged in the Liverpool Blitz of 1941 ; this restored after the end of the Second World War . Further restoration was carried out between 1993 and 1995 . = = Architecture = = = = = Exterior = = = The town hall is built of stone with a slate roof and a lead dome . Its plan consists of a rectangle with a portico extending to the south and Wyatt 's rectangular extension to the north . The extension is slightly narrower than the rest of the building , and also has a projecting portico . The building has two storeys and a basement ; the stonework of the basement and lower storey is rusticated . The south face , overlooking Castle Street , has nine bays . Its central three bays are occupied by the portico . This has three rounded arches on the ground floor , and four pairs of Corinthian columns in the upper storey surrounding a balcony . The east and west faces also have nine bays in the original part of the building , plus an additional three bays to the north on Wyatt 's extension . The middle three bays of the nine original bays project slightly forward and are surmounted by a pediment . The roof of the north face is higher than that of the main building . This face has five bays , with a central portico of three bays . On its first floor are four pairs of Corinthian columns and standing on the roof above these are four statues dating from 1792 by Richard Westmacott ; these statues have been moved from the Irish Houses of Parliament . Above the upper storey windows on all faces are panels containing carvings , some of which relate to Liverpool 's foreign trade . The dome stands on a high drum supported on Corinthian columns . Around the base of the dome are four clock faces , each of which is supported by a lion and unicorn . On the summit of the dome is a statue , representing Minerva . It is 10 feet ( 3 m ) high and was designed by John Charles Felix Rossi . = = = Interior = = = = = = = Ground floor = = = = The main door in the south face leads to the Vestibule or Entrance Hall . It has a floor of encaustic tiles which include depictions of the arms of Liverpool and the liver bird . The room is panelled and on the east side is a large wooden fireplace containing 17th-century Flemish carvings . It has a groin-vaulted ceiling , and in the lunettes are murals painted in 1909 depicting events in Liverpool 's history . Below these are brass tablets containing the names of the freemen of Liverpool . Also in the entrance hall are bardic chairs from the two Eisteddfods held in the city . At the rear of the ground floor in Wyatt 's extension is the Council Chamber . This has mahogany-panelled walls and can seat 160 people . Adjacent to the Council Chamber is the Hall of Remembrance . On its wall are panels bearing the names of the military men who lost their lives in the First World War , and eight murals painted by Frank O. Salisbury in 1923 . In the centre of the ground floor is the Staircase Hall described in the Buildings of England series as \" one of the great architectural spaces of Liverpool \" . A broad staircase rises between two pairs of Corinthian columns to a half-landing , and narrower flights climb from that on each side to the upper floor . On the ground floor on each side of the staircase are display cabinets holding the city 's silver . On the half-landing is a statue of George Canning dated 1832 by Francis Chantrey , and hanging on the wall above this is a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Sir Edward Halliday . Above the staircase the dome is carried by four pendentives ; it rises to a height of 106 feet ( 32 m ) and its interior is coffered . Around the base of the dome is inscribed Liverpool 's motto , \" Deus Nobis Haec Otia Fecit \" , and in the pendentives are paintings dated 1902 by Charles Wellington Furse depicting scenes of dock labour . = = = = Upper floor = = = = All the rooms on this floor are designed for entertainment and they have connecting doors that allow for a complete circuit of the floor .

                    "text": "Harmondsworth Great Barn = Harmondsworth Great Barn ( also known as Manor Farm Barn ) is a medieval barn on the former Manor Farm in the village of Harmondsworth , in the London Borough of Hillingdon , England ( previously part of the historic county of Middlesex ) . It is north-west of fields and the A4 next to Heathrow Airport . Built in the early 15th century by Winchester College , it is the largest timber-framed building in England and is regarded as an outstanding example of medieval carpentry . It was described by the English poet John Betjeman as the \" Cathedral of Middlesex \" . A similar though smaller barn is part of the Manor Farm complex in Ruislip . The barn was briefly in royal ownership but passed into the hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s . It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex . After the company went bankrupt in 2006 , the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded . The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year . English Heritage stepped in , using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner 's consent , and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012 . It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group . = = Structure = = The barn measures 58.55 metres ( 192.1 ft ) long , 11.3 metres ( 37 ft ) wide , and 11.9 metres ( 39 ft ) high , with twelve bays , running in a north \u2013 south direction . It occupies a footprint of about 661 square metres ( 7,110 sq ft ) and has an internal volume of about 4,890 cubic metres ( 173,000 cu ft ) . There are three doors on the east side to permit the entry of wagons . The exterior of the barn is weatherboarded , with a hipped tiled roof . It was originally a much larger structure , with two wings , but the north wing was dismantled in 1774 and rebuilt in the now-demolished hamlet of Heathrow , on the site of the modern airport . The vast majority of the surviving structure is original ; it has been estimated that 95 per cent of the timbers , including the external weatherboarding , have survived from the original building . It has been described by English Heritage as \" a supreme example of late-medieval craftsmanship \u2013 a masterpiece of carpentry containing one of the best and most intact interiors of its age and type in all of Europe . \" It is an outstanding example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England . Barns of this type were based on a longitudinal frame , with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates . Because such barns tend to be both long and high , they experience high structural loads from the wind . They therefore have numerous internal braces , acting in much the same way as buttresses , to strengthen the structure . This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance , with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof . The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time , and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved . The barn 's main posts are made of oak . Each is about 14 inches ( 36 cm ) square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone , a common building material in medieval London . The posts were cut into shape using axes , adzes and saws , the marks from which can still be seen in some instances . The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together on the ground and scratched Roman numerals , called assembly marks , on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined . Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two . They were all placed upside down , relative to the original direction of the tree . This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top ; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof . Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right , they may have made some mistakes along the way , as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and mortises that were never used . Alternatively , the timbers may have been reused from another construction . The rows of arcade posts support tie beams , with curved braces to strengthen the frame . The collar beam , which supports the opposing principal rafters , is supported by the crown post . Roof purlins run the length of the barn and are tenoned into the principal rafters , with additional support from curved wind braces . Some aspects of this design are unusual , both in the way that they are executed and in terms of their early date . A number of features in the barn 's carpentry are described by English Heritage as \" experimental , precocious and regionally unusual , \" which is attributed to the very high level of skill of the master carpenters who built it . The use of aisles enabled the barn 's architects to increase its width and by doing so , provided the maximum space for threshing floors . The longer the barn was , the more threshing floors could be provided . English barns went through an evolution in the number of threshing floors ; the earliest had just one central floor , a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain . Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three threshing floors , allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time . The boards on the exterior of the barn are made from a mixture of oak , elm and softwoods such as pine and fir . Some are of modern or relatively modern origins ; those on the south end of the barn are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and are the result of the repairs made after the 1972 fire . Each side of the barn 's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76,000 tiles , which were originally held in place by oak pegs . Many of the tiles have been replaced over the years and the oak pegs have been replaced by galvanised peg nails due to the effects of decay . The floor of the barn was originally made of hard-packed flint gravel held together with iron panning , excavated from a local gravel deposit , which was used as a more readily available alternative to stone . In subsequent years it was repaired with brick , tile and , ultimately , cement , obscuring the original appearance of the floor . An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained from the outside of the west side of the barn . The design of the barn has provided inspiration to a number of architects in the 19th and 20th centuries who were involved with the Gothic Revival movement . Sir George Gilbert Scott visited the barn in 1850 and sketched it , using its design as the basis for proposals for the new ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch , New Zealand . The library of Mansfield College , Oxford designed by Basil Champneys in the late 1880s also owes its inspiration to the barn . Bedales School 's library , completed in 1922 and designed by Ernest Gimson , may also have had its origins in the barn 's design . = = History = = The manor of Harmondsworth was owned before the Norman Conquest by King Harold Godwinson , but was seized by William the Conqueror after Harold 's death at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . Three years later , William granted it to William FitzOsbern , one of his close confidants . It was subsequently transferred to the Abbey of Rouen . In 1391 , it was acquired from the abbot and prior by William of Wykeham , the Bishop of Winchester . He gave it to Winchester College , which he had founded in 1382 , as part of his endowment of that establishment . Its revenues went towards supporting the college . There was already a \" Great Barn \" on the site , and as early as 1110 a manor record shows that men who were not wanted for ploughing were required to \" thresh in the Great Barn until sunset \" . A granary was recorded in a survey conducted in 1293 \u2013 4 and a further survey of 1324 recorded the existence of a monastic grange in addition to the granary . The wheat barn at Harmondsworth was damaged in a storm in 1398 and records from Winchester College show that two carpenters were sent to make repairs , for which a large quantity of tiles , nails and other roofing materials was purchased . By this time , however , the existing barn was evidently becoming inadequate . The college 's records indicate that in 1426 \u2013 7 it commissioned two men , William Kypping ( or Kipping ) and John atte Oke , to obtain timbers from Kingston upon Thames to use for a new barn at Harmondsworth . This date matches an early fifteenth-century origin for the Great Barn 's timbers , which has been established through dendrochronology . The architect is not known , but it is possible that William Wyse may have been involved . He was the main carpenter for New College , Oxford and the master carpenter at Windsor Castle in 1430 , and worked on repairing the aisles at the church of St Mary 's in Harmondsworth , practically next door to the manor . Carpenters from Ickenham and Uxbridge were also involved and a tiler appears to have been employed by the college at the same time . Once completed , the barn would have been used to thresh and store grain from the manor farm . In 1544 , the manor was taken by King Henry VIII to add to his hunting estate around Hampton Court but he does not appear to have used it , and shortly afterwards he granted it to the Paget family . It remained in their hands until 1869 . During the first half of the 20th century the manor was owned by the Ashby family . The last Ashby to farm there died in 1948 and the farm was sold in 1950 to Peter Purser , who died in the late 1970s . It was already a Scheduled Monument and was given Grade I listed building status in March 1950 when new heritage protection legislation was brought into force . The barn continued to be used for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s . It had a couple of narrow escapes during the 20th century ; during the Second World War a German V-1 flying bomb flattened a nearby barn , but only managed to dislodge a few roof tiles on the Great Barn . The barn 's southern bay was seriously damaged by fire in 1972 but it was subsequently restored . The building was greatly admired by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman , who dubbed it \" the cathedral of Middlesex \" . It underwent a detailed eighteen-month survey in the late 1980s by the craftsman Peter McCurdy ( who later went on to rebuild Shakespeare 's Globe theatre ) , supported by the Museum of London . = = Neglect and rescue = = The barn and the surrounding Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group , a builder / property developer which aimed to restore the barn to serve as a showcase for the company . The farm underwent major changes , with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L-shaped office building constructed facing the barn . Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn , following an initial renovation carried out in 1989 . However , in 2006 , the company went into receivership . The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver 's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through . The receiver offered the barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for \u00a3 1 , but both refused the offer . Instead , a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn . The company had no other assets and it was reported that it was seeking to speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport . Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished , although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway . The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn , which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September . The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings ( SPAB ) raised the alarm in a 2009 edition of its magazine , Cornerstone , in which the deteriorating condition of the barn was highlighted as the magazine 's cover story . The magazine reported that on a recent visit \" more than a dozen gaps in the tiled roof were seen , some large . The site appeared to lack fire-fighting equipment or alarms , and could be easily accessed . Plants have taken root in the stone-and-brick plinth , and have begun to damage the medieval blocks upon which the barn stands . \" English Heritage issued a statement saying : \" The absentee owner of the barn has declined to engage with English Heritage ( and the local authority ) for some years despite our offers of help , support , advice and grants . It should be noted that the Heathrow expansion area would surround the site of the barn on three sides but would not , according to plans we have seen , propose its demolition or removal . However , this still leaves question marks over the barn \u2019 s future and in particular , the issues of viability and setting . \" Following the publication of the Cornerstone article , English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that would lead to the compulsory purchase of the barn . It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009 , without the owners ' consent , under an Urgent Works Notice . The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works , declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building . This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily , overriding the owners ' objections . The repairs mainly involved fixing holes in the roof and preventing the ingress of rain water , as well as repairing the weatherboards on the sides . The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the \u00a3 30,000 cost of the repairs that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012 . In January 2012 , a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for \u00a3 20,000 . By that time the government had abandoned its plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a liability for the company . Simon Thurley , the Chief Executive of English Heritage , called the barn \" one of the greatest medieval buildings in Britain , built by the same skilled carpenters who worked on our magnificent medieval cathedrals . Its rescue is at the heart of what English Heritage does . \" The local Member of Parliament , John McDonnell , praised the hard work of local people and English Heritage staff and said that he was \" now overjoyed that we have secured this wonderful building for future generations . \" The SPAB also welcomed the decision , calling the barn one of the \" symbols of the dominance of the rural economy in the past , and the immense investment in craftsmanship and materials that agriculture deserved . \" = = Reopening and future management = = The barn is managed by volunteers from the Friends of the Great Barn at Harmondsworth , a local preservation group , acting on behalf of the owners , English Heritage . It is open to the public for free on the second and fourth Sunday of each month between April and October .",

                    "text": "Reticulate whipray = The reticulate whipray or honeycomb stingray ( Himantura uarnak ) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae . It inhabits coastal and brackish waters across the Indo-Pacific region from South Africa to Taiwan to Australia , favoring sandy habitats . A large species reaching 2 m ( 6.6 ft ) in width , the reticulate whipray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc and an extremely long tail without fin folds . Both its common and scientific names refer to its ornate dorsal color pattern of many small , close-set dark spots or reticulations on a lighter background . However , the reticulate whipray is only one of several large spotted stingrays in the Indo-Pacific which , coupled with the variability of its coloration with age and locality , has resulted in a great deal of taxonomic confusion . Often encountered resting on the bottom during daytime , the reticulate whipray is a predator of bottom-dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes . Like other stingrays , it is aplacental viviparous , with the developing embryos nourished at first by yolk and later by histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" ) . Females bear litters of up to five pups in summer , following a gestation period of a year . The reticulate whipray is fished in Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian Ocean for meat , skin , cartilage , and other purposes . It is highly susceptible to population depletion because of its large size , inshore habits , and low reproductive rate , and is additionally threatened by extensive habitat degradation . Consequently , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Vulnerable . = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = In 1775 , Carsten Niebuhr published Descriptiones animalium \u2013 avium , amphibiorum , piscium , insectorum , vermium : qu\u00e6 in itinere orientali observavit , the work of his late friend , the Swedish naturalist Peter Forssk\u00e5l . Within Forssk\u00e5l had described Raja sephen , now commonly known as the cowtail stingray , with a spotted variant he called uarnak , derived from an Arabic word that describes the color pattern . No type specimen was designated . Forssk\u00e5l 's account formed the basis for two subsequent writings that named the spotted ray as a distinct species : Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre 's Raia scherit in 1788 , and Johann Friedrich Gmelin 's Raja uarnak in 1789 . Although Bonnaterre 's name was published first and thus would have had precedence , later authorities have regarded Forssk\u00e5l 's uarnak as the earliest available name even though it was not initially part of a binomial . Consequently , modern sources give uarnak as the valid specific epithet and either Gmelin or Forssk\u00e5l as the species authority . In 1837 , Johannes Peter M\u00fcller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle included the reticulate whipray in the newly created genus Himantura ; David Starr Jordan and Barton Warren Evermann made it the type species in 1896 . The reticulate whipray is closely related to H. undulata and H. leoparda , which share much of its range . All three species are very similar in size , shape , and color pattern , resulting in a long history of taxonomic confusion that only recently is starting to be untangled . In 2004 , Mabel Manjaji described the ' uarnak ' species complex , containing H. fai , H. gerrardi , H. jenkinsii , H. leoparda , H. toshi , H. uarnak , and H. undulata , plus three more undescribed species . The reticulate whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range , and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species . Alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray , leopard stingray , longtail stingray , and marbled stingray ; some of these names are shared by other , similar species . = = Description = = The pectoral fin disc of the reticulate whipray is diamond-shaped and wider than long , with the leading margins almost straight and the snout and outer corners angular . In juveniles , the disc is about as wide as long , with a more obtuse snout and rounded corners . The eyes are small and immediately followed by the spiracles ( paired respiratory openings ) . A short and wide curtain of skin with a minutely fringed rear margin is present between the long , thin nostrils . The mouth is relatively small , with a deep concavity at the center of the lower jaw and shallow furrows at the corners extending onto the lower jaw . A row of 4 \u2013 5 papillae ( nipple-like structures ) is found across the floor of the mouth . There are 26 \u2013 40 upper tooth rows and 27 \u2013 44 lower tooth rows . The pelvic fins are small and triangular . The tail is whip-like and extremely thin , measuring 3 \u2013 3.5 times as long as the disc when intact , and lacks fin folds . Usually one serrated stinging spine is located on the upper surface on the tail , some distance from the base . Adult rays have a wide band of flattened , heart-shaped dermal denticles that extend from between the eyes to the tail spine , increasing in density with age , along with two large pearl thorns at the center of the back . The tail behind the spine is covered by small thorns . The dorsal band of denticles is largely developed by the time the juveniles are 50 cm ( 20 in ) across . The coloration of the reticulate whipray varies substantially with age and locality . Adults generally have a dorsal pattern of numerous closely spaced dark brown spots or reticulations on a beige to yellow-brown background , which becomes blackish past the spine with lighter bands on the sides . The underside is pale , without markings . Juveniles are yellowish above with tiny , densely packed dark spots , around seven spots in a line between the spiracles , and three rows of spots in front of the sting . This large species has been reported to reach a disc width of 2 m ( 6.6 ft ) , a total length of 6 m ( 20 ft ) , and a weight of 120 kg ( 260 lb ) . = = Distribution and habitat = = The reticulate whipray occurs widely in the Indo-Pacific , with a range extending from off eastern South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula , westward along the coast of the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia , and reaching as far as Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands to the north , and New Guinea and northern Australia to the southeast . It has also colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal . This species seems to be common only in Australian waters , where it occurs from Shark Bay to Brisbane . Bottom-dwelling in nature , the reticulate whipray is generally encountered over sandy flats near beaches , in lagoons , and around coral reefs , from the intertidal zone to offshore waters 50 m ( 160 ft ) deep or more . In Shark Bay , it frequents intertidal sand flats during the warm season , and shifts to slightly deeper seagrass patches in the cold season . This species is tolerant of low salinities and has been known to enter estuaries and mangrove swamps , though records from fresh water in Southeast Asia are unverified and may represent misidentifications . Its preferred water temperatures are 23 \u2013 26 \u00b0 C ( 73 \u2013 79 \u00b0 F ) . = = Biology and ecology = = During the day , the reticulate whipray is generally inactive and spends much time resting motionless on the sea floor , sometimes buried in sand . In Shark Bay , Western Australia , this ray can be found resting singly or in small groups in very shallow water during high tide . Its lateral line extends to the tip of its extremely long tail , giving it advance warning of approaching predators such as bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops aduncus ) and hammerhead sharks ( Sphyrna ) . The cowtail stingray ( Pastinachus sephen ) prefers to rest with the reticulate whipray over others of its own species , because the whiprays ' longer tails grant them superior predator detection . These mixed-species groups often settle into a \" rosette \" with their tails pointing radially outward for maximum predator awareness . The reticulate whipray preys on a variety of benthic and neritic organisms , including crabs , shrimps , mantis shrimps , bivalves , gastropods , worms , jellyfish , and bony fishes . In the western Indian Ocean , about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes , in particular ponyfish and anchovies , with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder . By contrast , rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous , and are known to consume penaeid prawns . Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum , Dendromonocotyle colorni , Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus , Monocotyle helicophallus , M. multiparous , and M. spiremae , Thaumatocotyle australensis , and Tylocephalum chiralensis . Like other stingrays , the reticulate whipray is aplacental viviparous : the developing embryos are initially sustained by yolk , which is later supplanted by histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" , enriched with proteins and lipids ) produced by the mother . Females give birth to up to five pups in the summer , after a year-long gestation period . Off South Africa , the newborns measure 28 \u2013 30 cm ( 11 \u2013 12 in ) across and sexual maturation is attained at a disc width of approximately 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) , which corresponds to an age of 4-5 . Off Australia , the newborns measure 21 \u2013 28 cm ( 8.3 \u2013 11.0 in ) across , with males reported to mature at 82 \u2013 84 cm ( 32 \u2013 33 in ) across . The juveniles of this species , H. leoparda , and H. undulata differ in birth size , disc shape , denticle development , and amount of spotting , and are in fact more distinct from each other than are adults of the three species . Shark Bay may serve as a nursery area for young rays . = = Human interactions = = The reticulate whipray fights strongly on hook-and-line and is thus popular with recreational anglers , who usually release it alive . This species is caught by intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries operating in Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian Ocean , using bottom trawls , gillnets and tangle nets , beach seines , and longlines . In particular , it is caught in substantial numbers by an Indonesian trawl fishery targeting wedgefishes in the Arafura Sea . The meat , skin , and cartilage are utilized , though this species is not a highly valued food fish . It also has applications in Chinese medicine , and its tail may be sold as a curio . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the reticulate whipray as Vulnerable . Its large size , inshore habitat preferences , and slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing . Although specific data is lacking , significant declines in overall ray catches have been documented within its range , including in the Gulf of Thailand , the Arafura Sea , and off Pakistan . Habitat degradation also threatens this species : over 30 % of the mangroves in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared since 1980 , while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also taken their toll . Australian waters offer the reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure , as there it is not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices ( TEDs ) have reduced bycatch mortality . However , there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels .",

                    "text": "Varanus salvadorii = Varanus salvadorii is a monitor lizard found in New Guinea . It is also known by the common names crocodile monitor , Papua ( n ) monitor , Salvadori 's monitor and artellia . The largest monitor lizard in New Guinea , it is believed to be one of the longest lizards in the world , verified at up to 244 cm ( 8 ft ) , and in rare cases it may rival or exceed the length of the world 's largest lizard , the Komodo dragon . It is the sole member of the subgenus Papusaurus . V. salvadorii is an arboreal lizard with a dark green body and yellowish bands , a blunt snout and a very long tail . It lives in mangrove swamps and coastal rainforests in the southeastern part of the island , where it feeds on birds , small mammals , eggs , and carrion in the wild , using teeth better adapted than those of most monitors for seizing fast-moving prey . Like all monitors , it has anatomical features that enable it to breathe more easily when running than other lizards can , and V. salvadorii may have greater stamina than most monitors . Little is known of its reproduction and development , as the species is very difficult to breed in captivity . V. salvadorii is threatened by deforestation and poaching , and is protected by the CITES agreement . The lizard is hunted and skinned alive by tribesmen to make drums , who describe the monitor as an evil spirit that \" climbs trees , walks upright , breathes fire , and kills men \" ; yet the tribesmen maintain that the monitor gives warnings if there are crocodiles nearby . = = Taxonomy and etymology = = V. salvadorii was first described as Monitor salvadorii by Wilhelm Peters and Giacomo Doria in 1878 from a female specimen with a snout-to-vent length of 48 cm ( 19 in ) long and a tail measuring 114 cm ( 45 in ) in length . The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic waral ( \u0648\u0631\u0644 ) , meaning \" lizard \" . The term \" monitor \" is thought to have come about from confusion between waral and the German warnen , meaning \" warning \" . The term \" goanna \" came about as a corruption of the name \" iguana \" . The specific name is derived from a Latinization of Tommaso Salvadori , an Italian ornithologist who worked in New Guinea . Later , in 1885 , it was renamed Varanus salvadorii by George Albert Boulenger . The Papua monitor is occasionally confused for the Asian water monitor ( V. salvator ) because of their similar scientific names . = = = Evolutionary development = = = The evolutionary development of V. salvadorii started with the genus Varanus , which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to Australia . Around 15 million years ago , a collision between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed the varanids to move into what is now the Indonesian archipelago . V. salvadorii has been placed cladistically as part of a species cluster with the lace monitor ( V. varius ) and the Komodo dragon ( V. komodoensis ) . This study was based upon mitochondrial DNA and microcomplement fixation analysis . A theory has been put forth that the species diverged from a common ancestor , as the Torres Strait separating New Guinea from Australia is less than 90 km ( 56 mi ) long , a distance that could have been covered fairly easily with island hopping . However , the similarities between V. salvadorii and V. varius may simply be an example of convergent evolution . Another clade postulated by Eric Pianka places V. salvadorii in a larger \" Australian \" clade of large monitors , along with other species as the Komodo dragon , the lace monitor , the perentie ( V. giganteus ) , the Argus monitor ( V. panoptes ) , and the sand goanna ( V. gouldii ) . = = Distribution = = The largest of the seven species of monitors found on the island of New Guinea , V. salvadorii occurs in both the state Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian region of West Papua . It inhabits the high and low canopies of the lowland rainforests and coastal mangrove swamps , sometimes venturing out of these areas during floods in the rainy seasons . No detailed field investigation data are available for V. salvadorii , so the full extent of its range is unknown . Its remote and generally inaccessible habitat is the main factor in preventing detailed study of this animal in its natural habitat . = = Biology and morphology = = The most characteristic feature of this monitor is its blunt , bulbous snout , which makes this species look different from every other monitor on New Guinea , and lends to its common name of tree crocodile . The body of the lizard is dark green with rings of yellow spots . The tail is banded yellow and black and is extremely long , being more than twice as long as the snout-to-vent length . It has long , straight teeth and prominent , curved claws . There is no external sexual dimorphism . Unique among living varanid species , the animal 's tail is two-thirds longer than the snout-to-vent length in both juveniles and adults . Herpetologist Robert Sprackland gives the proportion as the tail being 210 % of the animal 's body length . At hatching , V. salvadorii is about 45 cm ( 18 in ) long , while a sexually mature female may grow to 150 cm ( 4.9 ft ) . This is possibly the longest living species of lizards , although it is considerably less massive and heavy than the Komodo dragon . Specimens are known to reach at least 244 cm ( 8.01 ft ) in length. but it may grow longer . A specimen reportedly measuring 323 cm ( 10.60 ft ) was caught in Konedobu by Dr. F. Barker . Several reported specimens have been claimed to exceed 350 cm ( 11.5 ft ) , some even to 610 cm ( 20.0 ft ) , but most of these were second-hand reports and no museum specimens in this size range are known . Weight in the species has been reported to be up to 90 kg ( 200 lb ) , but this is an unverified and possibly dubious report , this species is much more slender even in large specimens than comparable length Komodo dragons . The average size of this species is under 200 cm ( 6.6 ft ) and average body mass is reportedly about 20 kg ( 44 lb ) . However 10 adult specimens were found to weigh only 5 to 6.38 kg ( 11.0 to 14.1 lb ) at a length of 1.16 to 2.25 m ( 3.8 to 7.4 ft ) so even the afforementioned weigh is fairly optimistic for this species . The average size of V. salvadorii caught in one study were 99.2 cm ( 39.1 in ) with a weight of 2.02 kg ( 4.5 lb ) but presumably consisted of largely or entirely young specimens . Varanus salvadorii has mammal-like aerobic abilities ; this is accomplished by means of a positive pressure gular pump in the animal \u2019 s throat to assist lung ventilation . The majority of lizards cannot run and breathe at the same time due to Carrier 's constraint , but monitor lizards are exceptions to this rule . The development of this ventilatory pump is analogous to the evolution of the diaphragm in mammals , which ventilates the lung independently of locomotion ; scientists place V. salvadorii as the species with the highest endurance in this regard . This would suggest the lizard is at an evolutionary midpoint , relying on both forms of breathing . = = Behavior = = As an arboreal lizard , it can hang onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip . The primary use of the tail , however , is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another . The tail may also be used for defense , as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails . This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade , but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable . Although they are known to rest and bask in trees , they sleep on the ground or submerged in water . These monitors will rise up on their hind legs to check their surroundings , a behavior that has also been documented in Gould 's monitors ( V. gouldii ) . They are known to exhibit a warning posture , in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them . According to native belief , they will give a warning call if they see crocodiles . In general V. salvadorii avoids human contact , but its bite is capable of causing infection , like the Komodo dragon 's . One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection . = = = Diet = = = The teeth of V. salvadorii do not resemble those of other monitor species , which are typically blunt , peglike , and face slightly rearward . Their upper teeth are long and fang-like , standing vertical from the jawbone , designed to hook into fast-moving or feathered prey such as birds , bats , and rodents . Their lower teeth are housed in a fleshy sheath . In the wild , V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea , feeding on birds , eggs , small mammals , and carrion . Natives have reported it may take down pigs , deer , and hunting dogs , and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it . Its only competition is the New Guinea singing dog , a type of dingo . Captive specimens have been known to eat fish , frogs , rodents , chickens , and dog food . This species has been observed hunting prey in a unique fashion for monitor lizards . Rather than following its prey to ambush it from behind , V. salvadorii will stalk its prey and anticipate where it will run , meeting it headlong . = = = Reproduction = = = Reproduction has only been observed in captivity , so nothing is known about its reproduction in the wild . The egg clutches , comprising four to 12 eggs , are deposited around October to January , with the eggs showing a remarkable difference in dimensions , a phenomenon for which no explanation is known . Dimensions may vary from 7.5 cm \u00d7 3.4 cm to 10 cm \u00d7 4.5 cm ( 3.0 in \u00d7 1.3 in to 3.9 in \u00d7 1.8 in ) , while weight may vary from 43.3 to 60.8 g ( 1.53 to 2.14 oz ) . Most clutches laid in captivity have been infertile , and only four successful breedings have been documented thus far . Hatchlings are about 18 inches ( 46 cm ) long and weigh around 56 g ( 2.0 oz ) . Like those of many other monitors , the hatchlings of V. salvadorii are more colorful than adults , and feed primarily on insects and small reptiles . = = Conservation status = = Varanus salvadorii is currently protected under the CITES Appendix II , which requires an exportation permit for international trade . It is not listed on the IUCN Red List or the Endangered Species Act . It faces threats from deforestation and poaching , as it is hunted and skinned alive by native peoples to make drums , who consider the monitor an evil spirit that \" climbs trees , walks upright , breathes fire , and kills men \" . In 2008 , a total of 52 individuals were maintained at 17 zoological parks in the United States , with an unknown number in private collections .",

It was formed from two former Yugoslav gendarmerie regiments , was created with the approval of the German military authorities , and for a long period was controlled by the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Territory . It was also known as the Nedi\u0107evci after the leader of the Serbian pro-Axis puppet government , General Milan Nedi\u0107 , who eventually gained control of its operations . It assisted the Germans in imposing one of the most brutal occupation regimes in occupied Europe and helped guard and execute prisoners at the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade . Its leaders and much of the rank and file were sympathetic to the Chetnik movement of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 , and it was purged by the Germans on several occasions for that reason . In October 1944 , as the Red Army closed on Belgrade , the SDS was transferred to Mihailovi\u0107 's control by a member of the fleeing Nedi\u0107 administration , but it quickly disintegrated during its withdrawal west , with only a small number of former SDS members being captured by the British near the Italian-Yugoslav border in May 1945 . = = History = = = = = Background = = = Following the Axis invasion , occupation and dismantling of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , the Wehrmacht established the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia under a military government of occupation . The territory included most of Serbia proper , with the addition of the northern part of Kosovo ( around Kosovska Mitrovica ) , and the Banat . It was the only area of the partitioned Kingdom of Yugoslavia in which the German occupants established a military government , to exploit the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it , and its valuable resources , particularly non-ferrous metals . The Military Commander in Serbia appointed Serbian puppet governments to \" carry on administrative chores under German direction and supervision \" . On 29 August 1941 , the Germans appointed the Government of National Salvation ( Vlada Nacionalnog Spasa , \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0430 ) under General Milan Nedi\u0107 , to replace the short-lived Commissioner Administration . = = = Formation = = = The Serbian State Guard ( or SDS ) was established by Nedi\u0107 on the basis of an understanding he reached with the German Military Commander in Serbia , General der Artillerie ( Lieutenant General ) Paul Bader , and the Higher SS and Police Leader in Serbia , SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer und Generalleutnant der Polizei ( SS-General of Police ) August Meyszner , regarding the maintenance of law and order in the occupied territory . It was formed on 10 February 1942 from two former Yugoslav gendarmerie regiments , Drinski and Dunavski , but the law formally creating the force was not issued by Nedi\u0107 until 2 March 1942 . The SDS took over the role and functions of the gendarmerie , and was initially commanded by Stevan Radovanovi\u0107 . Sources vary on the strength of the SDS . The Germans initially set a maximum strength of 17,000 , but the SDS quickly reached a strength of 18,500 . Initially the SDS included four groups , the Rural Police ( poljska stra\u017ea ) , the Municipal Police ( gradska stra\u017ea ) , the Frontier ( or Border ) Guard ( grani\u010dna stra\u017ea ) , and the Village Guard ( selja\u010dka stra\u017ea ) . The SDS was equipped using arms and ammunition captured by the Germans from throughout Europe , and was organised as a largely static force split across five regions ( oblasts ) : Belgrade , Kraljevo , Ni\u0161 , Valjevo and Zaje\u010dar , with one battalion per region . Each region was further divided into three districts ( okrugs ) , each of which included one or more SDS companies . A branch of the SDS was created specifically for service in the Banat , and was known as the Banat State Guard . It was formed from the region 's German minority ( or Volksdeutsche ) , and in March 1942 numbered less than one thousand . Nedi\u0107 intended that the SDS would not only maintain law and order and guard the borders , but also monitor the people 's requirements and offer assistance and protection in areas such as \" health care , cultural , educational and economic life \" . The SDS was royalist and was rapidly infiltrated by Chetniks loyal to Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 . It also lacked sufficient officers , and although it had some initial successes , it never developed into an effective military force . Meyszner took overall control of the SDS three days after its formation , a decision which was strongly opposed by Nedi\u0107 . = = = Operations = = = Along with other collaborationist military and paramilitary units , the SDS was used against the Partisans operating within the Territory . In late 1941 , prior to the formation of the SDS , the Serbian gendarmerie had participated in the German-led Operation Uzice , which drove the Partisans and Chetniks from the U\u017eice area . The SDS routinely executed captured Partisans , and frequently took and murdered hostages in towns and villages . The SDS also included former members of the gendarmerie that had assisted German troops to round up hostages to be shot at both Kraljevo and Kragujevac in October 1941 . In July 1941 , the Banjica concentration camp had been established in the suburbs of Belgrade . It was initially guarded by both the Gestapo and the SDS , but sole responsibility was eventually transferred to the SDS , who behaved sadistically and violently towards the inmates . Survivors of the camp stated that executions at the camp were carried out by both the Belgrade Special Police and the SDS , and that those executed included children . A total of 3,849 people were killed at the camp before it was closed on 3 October 1944 . The SDS became increasingly unpopular with the population as time went on . Despite their limited independence , the SDS actively engaged in dehumanising Jews , Roma and communist Serbs , and in killing people from those groups or delivering them to the Germans for execution . They engaged in the execution of hostages both under Gestapo or Wehrmacht control and at their own initiative . The SDS clashed with other collaborationist formations at times , specifically Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107 's Serbian Volunteer Corps ( Srpski dobrovolja\u010dki korpus or SDK ) , and the Pe\u0107anac Chetniks loyal to vojvoda Kosta Pe\u0107anac . In March 1942 , Nedi\u0107 suggested to the Germans that the SDK and Pe\u0107anac Chetniks be incorporated into the SDS and that he take control of the force , but this idea was firmly rejected . In mid-1942 , Meyszner appointed Dragomir Jovanovi\u0107 , the German-approved mayor and chief of police of Belgrade , as chief of Serbian State Security , which included responsibility for the SDS . The Germans considered that Radovanovi\u0107 was a Mihailovi\u0107 sympathiser , so in June 1942 he was replaced by Colonel Borivoje Joni\u0107 , the brother of Nedi\u0107 's minister of education , Velibor Joni\u0107 . In July 1942 the SDS consisted of 15,000 \u2013 20,000 men . In August and September 1942 , Nedi\u0107 again tried to have the SDS placed under his command , and the German refusal to do so contributed to him tendering his resignation . Nedi\u0107 had threatened to resign several times previously for similar reasons , but on this occasion the Germans took it more seriously and offered him an audience with Adolf Hitler . On that basis , Nedi\u0107 remained at his post . In October 1942 , the Border Guard was transferred to the Ministry of Finance . Also in 1942 , the Gestapo arrested some SDS officers suspected of having links with Mihailovi\u0107 , and by the end of 1942 the Germans had purged the SDS in an attempt to eliminate those who sympathised with Mihailovi\u0107 . One of the senior SDS officers arrested by the Gestapo during the purge was Lieutenant Colonel Milan Kalabi\u0107 , the prefect of Po\u017earevac , and father of one of Mihailovi\u0107 's unit commanders , Nikola Kalabi\u0107 . The elder Kalabi\u0107 had been passing information , arms and ammunition to Mihailovi\u0107 's Chetniks . In October 1943 , Milan Kalabi\u0107 was executed by the Germans along with other Chetnik commanders and men . By 1943 , most of the rank and file of the SDS was sympathetic to Mihailovi\u0107 's Chetniks , and SDS units were regularly being \" disarmed \" by them , sometimes even staging mock battles to disguise transfers of much needed weapons and ammunition to Mihailovi\u0107 's forces . Jovanovi\u0107 himself provided financial assistance to Mihailovi\u0107 from his own discretionary funds . In April 1943 , units of the SDS were praised by German commanders for their fighting against the Partisans near Bijeljina in eastern Bosnia . In June 1943 , the Germans rounded up and executed 1,139 Serb civilians under suspicion that they had been collaborating with the resurgent Partisans . The SDS were involved in these crimes , and throughout 1943 were actively involved in committing atrocities against Serbian civilians . After many delays , on 18 September 1943 Nedi\u0107 met with Hitler in Berlin and was promised that he would be given command of the SDS and the SDK . Upon his return to Belgrade , Nedi\u0107 called upon the Military Commander in Serbia , General der Infanterie Hans Felber , to make arrangements for the transfer of command , but Felber advised him that he had received no orders to do so . It was not until 2 November 1943 that Nedi\u0107 was finally given command of both the SDS and SDK . In late 1943 the SDS reached its maximum strength of 36,716 men . By February 1944 , the SDS leadership were avoiding any direct confrontations with Mihailovi\u0107 's Chetniks . In the spring and summer of 1944 , the SDS had declined to a strength of around 24,000 \u2013 25,000 men . With the return of the Partisans to Serbia proper , the SDS began to incur serious casualties . For example , between 15 March and 15 August 1944 , the SDS lost 157 men killed , 107 wounded and 26 missing . By August 1944 , SDS units were responding to Mihailovi\u0107 's call for a general mobilisation by defecting openly to his Chetniks . = = = Withdrawal and capture = = = Three days after the fall of the Nedi\u0107 regime on 6 October 1944 , Felber transferred the command of the SDS to General Miodrag Damjanovi\u010d , the head of Nedi\u0107 's secretariat and a principal confidant of Mihailovi\u0107 within Nedi\u0107 's administration . Damjanovi\u010d immediately placed himself and the remaining 6,500 troops of the SDS under Mihailovi\u0107 's command . The SDS was then renamed the \" Serbian Shock Corps ( Srpski udarni korpus or SUK ) of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland \" once again under the command of Radovanovi\u0107 and it joined the withdrawal of other Chetnik formations towards the Sand\u017eak region then into northeastern Bosnia . This arrangement resulted in a difficult and uneasy alliance which began to disintegrate under the pressures of the withdrawal . In the last days of December 1944 , the SUK participated , along with other Chetnik formations , in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Partisan-held city of Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia . This failure and mutual recriminations between Mihailovi\u0107 's Chetniks and the SUK resulted in the effective disintegration of the SUK . By mid-January 1945 , 5,000 former SDS members had rejoined the Germans , with some returning to Serbia to take advantage of Josip Broz Tito 's amnesty . Most were transported to Austria where they were used in labour battalions under the direction of Organisation Todt , but about 1,500 were allowed to move to the Ljubljana Gap area , where they could join other collaborationist forces , such as the SDK or the Chetnik formations of Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107 or Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107 . Mihailovi\u0107 was not concerned about their departure , describing the former SDS troops as the \" worst troops in the world \" . The remnants of the SDS / SUK and Mihailovi\u0107 's Chetniks remained under the overall command of Damjanovi\u010d as part of the Chetnik \u0160umadija Division . These Chetniks had been under the command of the SS since 12 December 1944 . They crossed the river So\u010da and surrendered to the British near the Italian-Yugoslav border on 5 May 1945 . Fortunately for them , they were interned as prisoners of war and other than a few senior officers , were not repatriated to Yugoslavia to face trial . = = Uniform and journal = = The SDS wore either the 1940 pattern olive green uniform of the Royal Yugoslav Army , or the earlier Kingdom of Serbia pattern which was a green-grey in the case of officers , and a greyish-ochre colour for enlisted ranks . These were obtained from stores secured during the invasion . The Review of the Serbian State Guard ( Glasnik Srpske Dr\u017eavne Stra\u017ee ) was the official gazette of the SDS , published from 1942 to the end of 1943 . The journal was edited by Joni\u0107 , and contributors included Nedi\u0107 and Milan A\u0107imovi\u0107 . = = = Books = = = Anti\u0107 , Ana ( 2012 ) . \" Police Force Under Occupation : Serbian State Guard and Volunteers ' Corps in the Holocaust \" .

                "Battle of Sant Esteve d 'en Bas = The Battle of Sant Esteve d 'en Bas took place on 10 March 1695 in the Catalan front of the War of the Grand Alliance . It was fought between a column of French regular infantry under Brigadier Urbain Le Clerc de Juign\u00e9 , governor of the nearby French-occupied Castellfollit de la Roca , and 16 companies of Catalan miquelets and several armed peasants at the orders of Ramon de Sala i Sa\u00e7ala , the veguer of the town of Vic . Juign\u00e9 's force was in a punitive expedition to burn the village of Sant Esteve d 'en Bas , whose inhabitants had refused to pay war contributions to the French army , when it was attacked by the Catalan militia and nearly destroyed in two separate engagements . The first and more bloody fight took place at the wood of Malatosquera and the bridge of Sant Roc , where the French lost 500 men killed or wounded . Defeated , Juign\u00e9 and his remaining troops fled to Olot , where they entrenched themselves in a convent . The Catalans forced the French to surrender by setting the building on fire . At the slight cost of 7 men killed and 5 wounded , the miquelets and peasants under Sala i Sa\u00e7ala killed 260 French soldiers and took 826 prisoners . Juign\u00e9 was among the first . This French defeat was followed , just a month later , by the blockade by Spanish troops , miquelets and armed peasants , of the French garrisons of Castellfollit and Hostalric , which the French command decided to demolish and evacuate on July under the impossibility of keeping both positions . = = Background = = Catalonia was one of the main fronts of the Nine Years ' War . However , lack of means and poor relations with the peasantry due to the Revolt of the Barretinas marked for the Spanish Viceroy of Catalonia , the Duke of Villahermosa , the early stage of the conflict . In 1689 the Admiral of Castile , Juan Gaspar Enr\u00edquez de Cabrera , said to the Spanish Council of State that \" the best relief that Catalonia can have are the outer capabilities , what would be done from Flanders , from Milan and from Navarre \" . The French army under the Duke of Noailles , however , was also short of resources , and attrition warfare prevailed on the first four years of the war . In 1694 , Louis XIV committed more resources to his army in Catalonia , and Noailles managed to break the Spanish defenses , defeating the Spanish army at the battle of Torroella , on the banks of the Ter river , and seizing the ports of Roses , Palam\u00f3s and Cadaqu\u00e9s , and the important city of Girona . In 1695 the French command found that the inhabitants of the areas occupied by the French army were reluctant to pay war contributions and started to oppose an organized and growingly successful resistance . During the winter of 1694-1695 , the inhabitants of Calella repelled a punishment force of 800 or 1,000 French soldiers from the Blanes garrison and killed between 60 or 100 of them . French troops were also harassed by Catalan militia forces , the miquelets , who laid ambushes to Noailles ' forces from woods and heights . One of the most effective leaders of the miquelets was Captain Ramon de Sala i Sa\u00e7ala , the veguer of Vic , who achieved two victories over the French during the winter : on late December he overran a convoy on way to Hostalric , killing 25 French soldiers and taking 25 prisoners , and on 24 February he defeated a company of French dragoons at Navata , killing 7 of them and taking 28 prisoners and 32 horses . One of the villages that refused to pay the French was Sant Esteve d 'en Bas . Despite a French party looted the place in punishment , the villagers still refused to obey . A force of 700 soldiers was dispatched on 28 December to arrest the aldermen , but they found the village abandoned and sacked it again , taking with them two priests as hostages . In March 1695 , as the locals were still rebellious , Monsieur de Saint-Sylvestre , the French governor of Girona , ordered Brigadier Juign\u00e9 , commander of the garrison of Castellfollit , to punish the village for the third time in command of 1,300 chosen men from his own garrison and those of Figueres , Banyoles and Besal\u00fa . These troops were taken from the German Alsace regiment , the Swiss Manuel and Schellenberg regiments , and the French Royal-Artillery regiment . Philippe de Courcillon , a famous French diarist , labeled them as \" of the best troops of that country \" . = = Battle = = The French force left Castellfollit 9 March on the evening , passed at some distance from Olot and spent the night at the palanca de Cudella , a ford on the Fluvi\u00e0 river . At dawn , some peasants and miquelets discovered them and sent a warning to Sant Esteve d 'en Bas . Women and children sought shelter in the surrounding mountains , while the men prepared to fight off the French column . They also called for help Ramon de Sala i Sa\u00e7ala , who was at the nearby village of Sant Feliu de Pallerols , with Captains Josep Mas de Roda and Pere Baliart i Teula , recruiting men to raise three new companies of miquelets . In the meantime , Juign\u00e9 reached la Vall d 'en Bas \u2013 the Bas valley \u2013 , leaving a rearguard at El Mallol , and took positions on the hill of Puigpardines . From there , he dispatched a third of his force to burn Sant Esteve . The French troops had burned 16 buildings when Ramon de Sala ahead 8 companies of miquelets and Pere Baliart leading 8 others arrived to the village and forced them to flee to Juign\u00e9 's position . At the hill of Puigpardines , Juign\u00e9 was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants of the local somatent \u2013 a type of militia \u2013 , when the arrival of Sala 's , Mas ' and Baliart 's miquelets convinced him to withdraw . When they tried to cross back the Fluvi\u00e0 , however , they found the way blocked . Juign\u00e9 decided then attempting to escape to Olot across the wood of Malatosquera and through the bridge of Sant Roc , but the Catalans anticipated him . Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one , and while Josep Mas de Roda , leading the first one , pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood , he blocked the bridge of Sant Roc ahead the second group . During the running fight under the trees Juign\u00e9 's force lost 25 men and abandoned part of its ammunitions . The French column , despite the harassment , managed to take control of the bridge and started to cross to the opposite bank of the Fluvi\u00e0 . The miquelets and armed peasants , however , fired on them from the south and killed up to 70 French soldiers . According to Charles S\u00e9vin , marquis de Quincy , a contemporary French artillery general and military historian of Louis XIV 's reign , Juign\u00e9 's corps was able to retreat to Olot in good order . On the other hand , the local 19th-century Catalan historian Esteve Paluzie i Cantalozella claimed that the French troops fled in disarray , leaving 150 prisoners to the Catalans , which they carried to Sant Esteve d 'en Bas under a heavy escort . Arriving to Olot , most of Juign\u00e9 's force took positions inside the convent of El Carme , while 90 Swiss soldiers of the rear entrenched themselves inside the hospital of the village . While the Swiss troops promptly surrendered , the bulk of the French column , with Juign\u00e9 himself , still held for two hours . The miquelets and peasants encircled the building and managed to open a gap in its walls , only to be repelled in the hand-to-hand fight , losing two men killed and one wounded . Sala 's men then breached the wall of a chapel and stormed the convent again , but as the French were well clustered within , the assault was as well repelled . Sala ordered to set on fire the gates of the building , but the French walled the gap using stones and bricks . The Catalans managed to enter the building by setting on fire large amounts of pitch and sulfur on the two breaches they had opened . The fire and the smoke blinded and choked the French soldiers , which retreated to the convent 's cloister . After that , Juign\u00e9 , seriously wounded during the fight , requested terms and surrendered . = = Aftermath = = The French column surrenderd on the promise that the officers would not be stripped , but they all remained as prisoners of war and surrendered their weapons and money to the Catalans . Juign\u00e9 , with 136 other wounded soldiers and a German captain , remained in Olot to receive medical treatment , but he died shortly after . French losses amounted to 251 or 260 men killed \u2013 32 of them officers \u2013 and 826 prisoners , as opposed to 7 men killed and 5 wounded on the miquelets side . The figures are well known , as the French intendant of Girona , Ren\u00e9 Desgrigny , wrote a letter to Olot 's aldermen asking for the number and rank of the prisoners to exchange them when possible . In this letter , Desgrigny noted that Monsieur Juign\u00e9 was lucky to be dead , as the defeat would probably have cost him dearly . The 690 unscathed French prisoners were brought first to Vic and later to Barcelona , where they arrived on 15 March . Their entrance was seen by a large crowd and the Spanish Viceroy , the Marquis of Gasta\u00f1aga . In the weeks that followed the battle , the Spanish troops and local militia increased their pressure on Castellfollit 's garrison . On 5 April , the Catalan miquelets , supported by five companies of dragoons and several peasants , defeated a party of French troops from Berga and Castellfollit , killing 60 soldiers and taking 200 prisoners . Noailles , then ill of rheumatism , ordered Lieutenant-general Saint-Sylvestre to assemble a supply convoy to relieve Castellfollit , which he put under an escort of 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry . A corps of miquelets , Spanish dragoons and peasants led by Blai de Trinxeria attacked and defeated the convoy on 15 April . After that , the French garrisons of Castellfollit and Hostalric fell under an effective blockade . On 19 May , Saint-Sylvestre assembled an army of 8,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry and relieved Hostalric , but Castellfollit remained blockaded . Noailles and his second in command were not in good terms : if Saint-Sylvestre advocated for demolishing and abandoning both Hostalric and Castellfollit , Noailles was not willing to give ground . On late June , Louis XIV replaced Noailles for Louis Joseph , Duke of Vend\u00f4me . Noailles charged Saint-Sylvestre of incompetence and , as did with other high officers , of looting the country on his own benefit , which had put on arms the peasantry against the French army . On 8 July Vend\u00f4me led his troops before Castellfollit . Having expelled its population and eaten horses and mules , the French garrison , diminished by desertions , was in an unsustainable position , and Vend\u00f4me came to evacuate and demolish the fortress . After that , the French army took the way to Hostalric and demolished its defenses , returning to Girona on 28 July .",
                "Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) = The Battle of Bloody Creek was fought on 10 / 21 June 1711 during Queen Anne 's War . An Abenaki militia successfully ambushed British and New England soldiers at a place that became known as Bloody Creek after the battles fought there . The creek empties into the Annapolis River at present day Carleton Corner , Nova Scotia , and was also the location of a battle in 1757 . The battle was part of an orchestrated attempt by the leaders of New France to weaken the British hold on Annapolis Royal . The British had only captured the fort the previous year and they only had a very tenuous control of the area . The battle , in which the entire British force was captured or killed , emboldened the French and their native allies to blockade Annapolis Royal . Without heavy weapons , the force was unable to effectively attack the fort , and abandoned the siege when British reinforcements arrived by sea . = = Background = = Port Royal , the capital of the French colony of Acadia , was settled in 1604 , one year after Acadia 's founding , and served as the colonial capital for much of the next hundred years . It consequently became a focal point for conflict between the English colonists of New England and the Acadian inhabitants . It was destroyed in 1613 by English raiders led by Samuel Argall , but eventually rebuilt . In 1690 it was captured by forces from the Province of Massachusetts Bay , although it was restored to France on 20 September 1697 by the Treaty of Ryswick . In the 1710 Siege of Port Royal an expedition of New England militia and British marines under Francis Nicholson again captured Port Royal . The town was renamed Annapolis Royal , with Samuel Vetch as the British Governor of Nova Scotia , and the fort was renamed Fort Anne . This expedition left a garrison numbering about 450 men , that was composed of a combination of British marines and New England provincial militia . The garrison was reinforced with regular troops in the following months , however the British only had effective control of the fort and the nearby town . The terms of capitulation had included a provision in which the French residents within 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) of the fort were to be protected , provided they took an appropriate oath to the British crown . A total of 481 Acadians were covered by this provision , but by mid-January 1711 only 57 had actually taken an oath . When word of Port Royal 's fall reached France , the marine minister Pontchartrain ordered Antoine Gaulin , the French Catholic missionary priest to the loosely allied Indian tribes of present-day Maine and New Brunswick , to harass the British at Annapolis Royal so that they could not establish a firm foothold in the territory . Bernard-Anselme d 'Abbadie de Saint-Castin , the m\u00e9tis Acadian ( French father and a Penobscot mother ) , was given military command of Acadia , and received similar orders . = = Prelude = = The first winter was a particularly difficult one for the British garrison , which was reduced by early 1711 to about 240 \" effective men Officers included \" due to death , disease , and desertion . They had ongoing difficulty getting provisions and materials needed to repair the fort because of the reluctance of the Acadians to help . This reluctance was fueled in part by the activities of Saint-Castin and Gaulin \u2014 the Acadians in Annapolis Royal refused to do the necessary logging , citing the danger of Indian attacks . To counter this , the British began sending out armed parties to protect the loggers . These logging parties were sent into the woodlands up the Annapolis River , and the cut wood was floated down the river . In May 1711 Governor Vetch received reports that these work crews and others who supported the British were being harassed by Mi 'kmaq and Abenakis opposed to British rule . In his reports he noted that the fort was \" every day more and more Infested with skulking Indians \" , and that villagers within the banlieu ( the three-mile protection area ) were being harassed . Desperate for timbers to repair the fort , Vetch organized a force of 70 New England militia under Captain David Pigeon to accompany the fort 's engineer on an expedition up the river . Pigeon 's instructions were to assure the loggers that they would be paid and protected if they brought the timber down to the fort , but that there would be \" severity \" if they did not . Not long before Pigeon 's party set out , an Indian force organized by Gaulin and Saint-Castin arrived in the area north of Annapolis Royal , with instructions to harass and ambush the British when the opportunity presented itself . The exact size and composition of this force is not known with precision . Vetch reported it to be 150 , but other sources reported it to be as low as 50 men . Many historians report that the force was composed of Abenakis , although Geoffrey Plank and others claim that the force also included some Mi 'kmaq . British Lieutenant Paul Mascarene for a time thought that some local Acadians might have been involved , but thought this unlikely after learning of its recent arrival ( literally the day before , according to one account ) in the area . The identity and ethnicity of its leader is also uncertain ; Governor Vaudreuil reported that it was led by someone named l 'Aymalle . = = Battle = = The New Englanders departed Annapolis Royal on 10 / 21 June in a whaleboat and two flatboats , heading up the Annapolis River . Because they were delayed by the tide , word of the force 's departure preceded them , giving the Indians time to set up an ambush near the mouth of what later became known as Bloody Creek . The whaleboat was faster on the water , and was about a mile ( 1.6 km ) ahead of the flatboats when it reached the ambush site . The surprise was complete : all but one of the whaleboat 's men were killed . Hearing the gunfire , the flatboats hurried to catch up , and carelessly made directly for the whaleboat . This exposed them to fire from Indians on the shore , and they suffered further significant casualties before they were surrounded and the survivors surrendered . Sixteen were killed , nine wounded , and the rest were captured . = = Aftermath = = The victory at Bloody Creek rallied the local resistance , and prompted many of the Acadians who were nominally under British protection to withdraw to the north . Soon thereafter a force of some 600 warriors , including Acadians , Abenaki , and Mi 'kmaq , gathered and blockaded Fort Anne under the leadership of Gaulin and Saint-Castin . The defending garrison was small , but the attackers had no artillery and were thus unable to make an impression on the fort , and the fort was still accessible by sea . Gaulin went to Plaisance in Newfoundland for supplies and equipment to advance the siege ; Governor Philippe Pastour de Costebelle provided supplies , but the ship had the misfortune to encounter a major British fleet and was captured . That same expedition abandoned its goal of attacking Quebec when eight of its ships were lost on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River ; Governor Vetch , who had accompanied the expedition as a leader of the provincial militia , returned to Annapolis Royal with 200 provincial militia , after which the besiegers withdrew . Annapolis Royal remained in British hands for the remainder of the war , but Acadians and Indians continued to resist the British after peace was reached and Acadia was formally ceded to Britain with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . This resistance was motivated by a French desire to recover Acadia and by the concerns of the Abenaki and Mi 'kmaq , who had not been parties to Utrecht , to British encroachment on their lands and liberties after the war ended . The Indian disputes led to Dummer 's War in the 1720s ; it was fought primarily in northern New England , but British settlements in Nova Scotia were also attacked . The disputes between the French and British over Acadia / Nova Scotia were not resolved until the British conquests of the Seven Years ' War and the expulsion of the Acadians in the 1750s . The site was again the scene of battle during the Seven Years ' War , and has been designated by the Canadian government as a National Historic Site of Canada .",
                "Siege of Fort St. Jean = The Siege of Fort St. Jean ( also called St. John , St. Johns , or St. John 's ) was conducted by American Brigadier General Richard Montgomery on the town and fort of Saint-Jean in the British province of Quebec during the American Revolutionary War . The siege lasted from September 17 to November 3 , 1775 . After several false starts in early September , the Continental Army established a siege around Fort St. Jean . Beset by illness , bad weather , and logistical problems , they established mortar batteries that were able to penetrate into the interior the fort , but the defenders , who were well-supplied with munitions , but not food and other supplies , persisted in their defence , believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton . On October 18 , the nearby Fort Chambly fell , and on October 30 , an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted . When word of this made its way to St. Jean 's defenders , combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort , the fort 's defenders capitulated , surrendering on November 3 . The fall of Fort St. Jean opened the way for the American army to march on Montreal , which fell without battle on November 13 . General Carleton escaped from Montreal , and made his way to Quebec City to prepare its defences against an anticipated attack . = = Background = = Fort Saint-Jean guarded the entry to the province of Quebec on the Richelieu River at the northern end of Lake Champlain . When Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen captured Fort Ticonderoga and raided Fort St. Jean in May 1775 , Quebec was garrisoned by about 600 regular troops , some of which were widely distributed throughout Quebec 's large territory . = = = Continental Army preparations = = = The invasion of Quebec began when about 1500 men , then under the command of General Philip Schuyler , arrived at the undefended \u00cele-aux-Noix in the Richelieu River on September 4 , 1775 . On September 6 , the Americans began making forays toward Fort St. Jean , only 10 mi ( 16 km ) away . The army was initially composed of militia forces from New York and Connecticut , with most of its operation directed by Brigadier General Richard Montgomery , who took over complete command from Schuyler on September 16 , when Schuyler became too ill to continue leading the invasion . = = = British defensive preparations = = = Fort St. Jean had been under preparations for an attack from the south ever since Arnold 's raid on Fort St. Jean on May 18 , in which he captured its small garrison and Lake Champlain 's only large military ship . When news of that raid reached Montreal , 140 men under the command of Major Charles Preston were immediately dispatched to hold the fort . Another 50 Canadian militia were raised in Montreal on May 19 , and were also sent to the fort . When Moses Hazen , the messenger bearing news of Arnold 's raid , reached Quebec City and notified British Governor and General Guy Carleton of the raid , Carleton immediately dispatched additional troops from there and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to St. Jean . Carleton himself went to Montreal on May 26 to oversee arrangements for the defense of the province , which he decided to concentrate on St. Jean , as it was the most likely invasion route . By the time the Americans arrived at \u00cele-aux-Noix , Fort St. Jean was defended by about 750 men under the command of Major Charles Preston . The majority of these were regular troops from the 7th and 26th Regiments of Foot and the Royal Artillery . There were 90 locally-raised militia , and 20 members of Colonel Allen Maclean 's Royal Highland Emigrants , men who were veterans of the French and Indian War . A detachment of Indians ( probably Caughnawaga from a nearby village ) patrolled outside the fort under the direction of Claude de Lorimier and Gilbert Tice . The Richelieu River was patrolled by an armed schooner , the Royal Savage , under the command of Lieutenant William Hunter , with other boats under construction . The fort itself , sited on the west bank of the Richelieu River , consisted of two earthen redoubts about 600 feet ( 180 m ) apart , surrounded by a ditch 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) wide and 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) deep that was lined with chevaux de frise . The southern redoubt was roughly 250 by 200 feet ( 80 by 65 metres ) , and it contained 6 buildings , including a bake house , the fort 's magazine , and storage houses . The northern redoubt was slightly larger , enclosing a two-storey stone house that was used as a barracks . The defenders had cleared brush for several hundred yards around the fort to ensure a clear field of fire . They had put up a wooden palisade to the west of the redoubts , and dug a trench connecting the two redoubts , for ease of communications . The eastern side of the fort faced the river , where there was a shipyard and anchorage for the Royal Savage . = = First approach = = = = = Skirmish with Indians = = = On September 6 , Generals Schuyler and Montgomery led a force of men in bateaux to a landing point about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) upriver from Fort St. Jean . Schuyler remained with the boats while Montgomery led some men into the swampy lands above the fort . There they were surprised by about 100 Indians led by Tice and Lorimier . In the ensuing skirmish , the Americans suffered 8 dead and 9 wounded , while the Indians suffered 4 dead and 5 wounded , with Tice among the wounded . The American troops , which were relatively untried militia forces , retreated to the boats , where they erected a breastwork for protection . The fort 's defenders , seeing this , fired their cannon at the breastwork , prompting the Americans to retreat about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) upriver , where they set up a second breastwork and camped for the night . The Indians , resentful that neither the British forces in the fort nor the habitants had come to their support in the engagement , returned to their homes . At this camp , Schuyler was visited by a local man , believed by some historians to be Moses Hazen . Hazen , a Massachusetts-born retired officer who lived near the fort , painted a bleak portrait of the American situation . He said that the fort was defended by the entire 26th regiment and 100 Indians , that it was well-stocked and ready for a siege . He also said that the habitants , while friendly to the American cause , were unlikely to help the Americans unless the prospects for victory looked good . Schuyler held a war council on September 7 , in which the command decided to retreat back to \u00cele-aux-Noix . However , on September 8 , reinforcements arrived : another 800 men including Connecticut militia under David Wooster and New Yorkers with artillery , joined them . Heartened by this arrival , they decided instead to proceed with a nighttime attempt on the fort . Schuyler , whose illness was getting more severe ( he was so ill \" as not to be able to hold the pen \" ) , turned command of the army over to Montgomery . Reports of this first contact between opposing forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated , with many local reports claiming it as some kind of victory . The Quebec Gazette , for example , reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans , killing 30 and wounding 40 . Following this news , General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia . Officers of the militia reported to Montreal , but many militia men stayed home . By September 7 , a troop of about 120 men was raised , which was sent to Fort St. Jean . = = = Propaganda and recruiting = = = On September 8 , Schuyler sent Ethan Allen ( acting as a volunteer since he had been deposed as head of the Green Mountain Boys by Seth Warner ) and John Brown to circulate a proclamation announcing the Americans ' arrival , and their desire to free the Canadians from the bondage of British rule . Allen and Brown traveled through the parishes between St. Jean and Montreal , where they were well-received , and even provided with local guards . James Livingston , a local grain merchant ( and a relative of Montgomery 's wife ) , began raising a local militia near Chambly , eventually gathering nearly 300 men . Allen also visited the village of the Caughnawaga , from whom he received assurances of their neutrality . The Caughnawaga had been the subject of a propaganda war , with Guy Johnson , the British Indian agent , trying to convince them ( as well as other tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy ) to take up arms against the Americans . However , Schuyler had successfully negotiated an agreement in August with most of the Iroquois to remain neutral . Word of this agreement reached the Caughnawaga on September 10 ; when Carleton and Johnson learned of it , Johnson sent Daniel Claus and Joseph Brant in an attempt to change the minds of the Caughnawaga ; their entreaties were refused . = = Second approach = = On the night of September 10 , Montgomery led 1000 men out again , returning to the first landing site by boat . In the confusion of the darkness and the swamp , some of the troops were separated from the rest . When they encountered one another again , there was panic , as the each mistook the other for the enemy . After just 30 minutes in the swamp , they returned to the landing . Montgomery , who had stayed with the boats , sent the troops out again . This time , the vanguard encountered a few Indians and habitants , and again panicked . Two of the \" enemy \" were killed , but the troops again made a disorderly retreat to the landing , which their commander , Colonel Rudolphus Ritzema , was apparently unable to stop . While the command staff met to discuss the next move , word came in that the British warship Royal Savage was approaching . This started a disorganized retreat up the river back to Ile-aux-Noix , in which the command staff was nearly left behind . A third attempt was planned for September 13 ; bad weather delayed attempts until September 16 . However , General Schuyler was by this time so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga . He left that day , turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery . Schuyler was not the only one falling ill ; the bad weather , and the swampy , malaria-infested terrain of \u00cele-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops , as more of them became ill as well . The bad news was tempered by good ; an additional 250 troops , in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner , and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel , arrived at \u00cele-aux-Noix . = = Siege begins = = On September 17 , Montgomery 's army disembarked from their makeshift fleet just south of St. Jean , and sent out John Brown with a detachment to block the road going north from the fort to Montreal . A small flotilla of armed boats guarded the river against the possibility of Royal Savage attacking the army as it landed . Brown and his men made their first interdiction that day , capturing a wagon-train of supplies destined for the fort . Preston , seeing that this had happened , sent out a sortie to recover the goods . Brown 's men , who had had time to hide the supplies in the woods , retreated until the sounds of the conflict reached the main body of the army . Montgomery , along with Bedel and his company , rushed to Brown 's aid , and succeeded in driving the British back into the fort without recovering the supplies . During this encounter , Moses Hazen was first captured and questioned by Brown , and then arrested again by the British , and brought into the fort . That night , Hazen and Lorimier , the Indian agent , sneaked out of the fort and went to Montreal , to report the situation to Carleton . Montgomery began entrenching his troops around the fort on September 18 , and constructing a mortar battery south of the fort . He ordered Brown to establish a position at La Prairie , one of the sites where there was a crossing of the Saint Lawrence River to Montreal . Ethan Allen went with a small company of Americans to collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting , and take them to monitor Longueuil , the other major crossing point . Livingston had established a base at Point-Olivier , below Fort Chambly , another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River , and was urging his compatriots to join him there . Some Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston ; Livingston 's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize , and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city . Allen , who was already renowned for his bravado in the action at Fort Ticonderoga , decided , when he reached Longueuil on September 24 , to attempt the capture of Montreal . In the Battle of Longue-Pointe , this effort failed on the next day , with Allen and a number of men captured by the British . The alarm raised by Allen 's proximity to Montreal resulted in the mustering of about 1,200 men from rural districts outside Montreal . Carleton failed to capitalize on this upwelling of Loyalist support by using them for a relief expedition against the besieging Americans . After several weeks of inaction by Carleton , the rural men drifted away , called by the demands of home and harvest . ( Carleton did take advantage of the moment to order the arrest of Thomas Walker , a Montreal merchant who was openly pro-American and had been reporting to the Americans . ) The conditions for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult . The ground was swampy , and the trenches quickly became filled knee-deep in water . Montgomery described his army as \" half-drowned rats crawling through a swamp \" . To make matters even worse , food and ammunition supplies were running out , and the British showed no sign of giving in despite the American bombardment . Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans ; by mid-October , more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness . In the early days of the siege , the fort 's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries . Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that \" a deserter [ tells us where ] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as much as we can with shells . \" Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga , the fort 's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower . = = Large cannon arrive = = On October 6 , a cannon that was dubbed the \" Old Sow \" arrived from Ticonderoga . Put in position the next day , it started lobbing shells at the fort . Montgomery then began planning the placement of a second battery . While he first wanted to place one to the northwest of the fort , his staff convinced him instead to place on the eastern shore of the Richelieu , where it would command the shipyard and the Royal Savage . This battery , whose construction was complicated by an armed row galley sent from the fort to oppose the works , was completed on October 13 , and opened fire the next day . One day after that , the Royal Savage lay in ruins before the fort . Its commander had , in anticipation of her destruction , ordered her to be anchored where her supplies and armaments might be recovered . = = Fort Chambly taken = = James Livingston had advanced to Montgomery the idea of taking Fort Chambly , near where his militia was encamped . One of Livingston 's captains , Jeremy Duggan , had , on September 13 , floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean , and these guns were put to use to that end . Chambly , which was garrisoned by only 82 men , mostly from the 7th Foot , was surrendered on October 18 by its commander , Major Joseph Stopford , after two days of bombardment . Most seriously , Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans , primarily gunpowder , but also winter provisions . Six tons of powder , 6,500 musket cartridges , 125 muskets , 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured . Timothy Bedel negotiated a cease-fire with Major Preston so that the prisoners captured at Chambly could be floated up the river past St. Jean . The loss of Chambly had a dispiriting effect at St. Jean ; some of the militia wanted to surrender , but Preston would not allow it . Following Chambly 's capitulation , Montgomery renewed his intention to construct a battery northwest of St. Jean . This time , his staff raised no objections , and by the end of October guns that were emplaced there opened fire on the fort . = = Carleton tries to help = = In Montreal , Carleton was finally prodded to move . Under constant criticism for failure to act sooner , and mistrustful of his militia forces , he developed a plan of attack . He sent word to Colonel Allan Maclean at Quebec to bring more of his Royal Highland Emigrants and some militia forces to Sorel , from where they would move up the Richelieu toward St. Jean , while Carleton would lead a force across the Saint Lawrence at Longueuil . Maclean raised a force of about 180 Emigrants , and a number of militia . By the time he reached Sorel on October 14 , he had raised , in addition to the Emigrants , about 400 militia men , sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits . His and Carleton 's hopes were dashed on October 30 , when Carleton 's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 ( mostly militia , with some Emigrants and Indian support ) was repulsed by the Americans . A few of his boats were landed , but most were driven off by Seth Warner 's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly . Maclean attempted to press forward , but his militia forces began to desert him , and the forces under Brown and Livingston were growing in number . He retreated back to Sorel , and made his way back to Quebec . = = Surrender = = In late October , the American troop strength surged again with the arrival of 500 men from New York and Connecticut , including Brigadier General David Wooster . This news , combined with the new battery trained on the fort , news of the failed relief expedition , and dwindling supplies , made the situation in the fort quite grim . On November 1 , Montgomery sent a truce flag , carried by a prisoner captured during Carleton 's aborted relief attempt , into the fort . The man delivered a letter , in which Montgomery , pointing out that relief was unlikely to come , offered to negotiate a surrender . Preston , not entirely trusting the man 's report , sent out one of his captains to confer with Montgomery . The counteroffer , which Montgomery rejected , owing to the lateness of the season , was to hold a truce for four days , after which the garrison would surrender if no relief came . Montgomery let the captain examine another prisoner from Carleton 's expedition , who confirmed what the first one had reported . Montgomery then repeated his demand for an immediate surrender , terms for which were drawn up the next day . Preston 's troops marched out of the fort and surrendered their weapons on November 3 , with the regulars in full dress uniform . He surrendered 536 officers and soldiers , 79 Canadien and 8 English volunteers . = = Aftermath = = Following the news of St. Jean 's surrender , Carleton immediately began preparing to leave Montreal . He left Montreal on November 11 , two days before American troops entered the city without opposition . Narrowly escaping capture when his fleet was forced to surrender after being threatened by batteries at Sorel , he made his way to Quebec to prepare that city 's defenses . Casualties on both sides during the siege were relatively light , but the Continental Army suffered a significant reduction in force due to illness throughout the siege . Furthermore , the long siege meant that the Continental Army had to move on Quebec City with winter setting in , and with many enlistments nearing expiration at year 's end . Richard Montgomery was promoted to Major General on December 9 , 1775 , as a result of his successful capture of Saint Jean and Montreal . He never found out ; the news did not reach the American camp outside Quebec before he died in the December 31 Battle of Quebec . In 1776 , the British reoccupied the fort following the Continental Army 's abandonment of it during its retreat to Fort Ticonderoga . = = Legacy = = The British ( and then Canadian ) military occupied the Fort Saint-Jean site until 1995 , using it since 1952 as the campus of the Royal Military College , which still occupies part of the site .

                "Battle of Alton = The Battle of Alton ( also Storm of Alton ) , of the First English Civil War , took place on 13 December 1643 in the town of Alton , Hampshire , England . There , Parliamentary forces serving under Sir William Waller led a successful surprise attack on a winter garrison of Royalist infantry and cavalry serving under the Earl of Crawford . In the context of the First English Civil War , the Battle of Alton was the first decisive defeat of Sir Ralph Hopton , leader of Royalist forces in the south , and the event had a significant psychological effect on him as commander . More important to Hopton was the loss of men , however , as he was already short-handed in much-needed infantry . The successful Parliamentarians were able , after their victory , to attack and successfully besiege Arundel , a larger and more formidable Royalist outpost in the south of England . At dawn on the 13th , as Waller 's army approached Alton , Crawford fled with the cavalry to Winchester , leaving Colonel Richardus Boles to defend Alton with only the infantry . Outnumbered and overpowered , Boles 's men were soon forced to seek refuge in the Church of St Lawrence , where they made a desperate last stand . Boles was killed , along with most of his remaining men . The Parliamentarians won a clear victory , losing only a few men and taking many prisoners . Boles 's fight is also notable for its demonstrated drama and heroism . Stories boast of Boles , who is said to have killed a number of his enemies before falling himself . The battle of Alton is known as one of the \" most savage encounters \" of the English Civil War . Indeed , musket holes from this fierce fight can still be seen in the south door to the church and inside , where so many cornered men were killed and captured . The Battle of Alton was notably the first battle in the English Civil War to use leather guns , employed effectively by Waller before and during the battle proper . = = Background = = On 13 September 1643 , English Parliament ordered Major General William Waller to muster forces for the \" protection \" of Hampshire County . In November , he was given control of forces stationed in Farnham , a major Parliamentary staging ground , in order to take control of Kent , Surrey , Sussex and Hampshire . These forces were supplemented by the Red Regiment ( from Westminster ) and the Green and Yellow regiments ( from London ) . Also at Waller 's disposal were a personal regiment of foot soldiers and surviving cavalry from the Battle of Roundway Down . Waller marched from Farnam for Odiham and Alton , intending to occupy these towns while gradually approaching his objective , Basing . While not of great strategic importance , Basing 's proximity to the main road between London , Salisbury , and Winchester made it worthy of attention . Marching toward Alton , Waller halted at Bentley Green on 3 November , where he determined his capabilities . He marched further that day , but later retreated to Farnham . On 2 November , Waller attacked one hundred men of Bennett 's at Alton . From 7 \u2013 9 November , Waller laid siege to Basing House , but withdrew to Basingstoke in failure , with his soldiers near mutiny from poor weather conditions . He tried again on the night of 11 November , but retreated to Farnham to await Hopton 's army . Hopton arrived on 27 November , given by King Charles 1,580 horse , but only around 2,000 conscripted infantry and 500 troops recently returned from fighting in Munster , Ireland . Hopton had been ordered in late September to make secure Dorset , Wiltshire and Hampshire , and to push as far as possible toward London . Toward this end , Hopton spread his men across Hampshire County , quartering them for the winter at Winchester , Alresford , Petersfield and Alton . He did so to alleviate the burden on any one town , and because winter was approaching quickly . However , this left his army vulnerable . Hopton placed Crawford in charge of Alton , and on 1 December Crawford began to fortify the small town as quickly as he could . Crawford had at his disposal one cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment , though his exact number of men is unknown ; it was likely around 1,000 . = = Prelude = = During the week prior to the Battle of Alton , Waller scouted the town and planned his attack . He confided his intent to only a few of his senior men , maintaining secrecy . Waller did make another raid on the evening of 9 December , where a small party of his forces struck at Crawford 's lodging but fell back after the minor attack . During the morning hours of 12 December , Crawford sent a missive to Farnham , requesting of Waller that he be sent a \" runlet of sack \" , promising an ox in exchange . When the wine was sent , Crawford refused to send the ox , challenging Waller to fetch it himself . Reverend G.N. Godwin 's Civil War in Hampshire ( 1882 ) During this exchange , Waller , eager to repair his reputation after Roundway Down , promptly decided to attack Alton , the nearest Royalist outpost to Farnham and only ten miles away . According to the Mercurius Aulicus , a contemporary publication , Crawford was watching only the main road from Farnham at this time . = = Battle = = Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10 : 30 p.m. , on 12 December . At around midnight , 5,000 of Waller 's men marched west from Farnham toward Basing House . The Parliamentarians marched about two miles in this direction ( in order to confuse Royalist scouts ) , until around 1 : 00 a.m. , before abruptly turning south toward Alton . The march was quick and quiet , owing to a long frost which had hardened the roads and Waller 's judicious use of wooded areas . Also helpful in Waller 's advance was his use of leather guns , here employed for the first time in the English Civil War . Unlike heavier artillery , a leather gun could be led by a single horse , transported efficiently over difficult terrain , and still be an effective tool for bombardment . Waller 's forces reached the western side of Alton at around 9 : 00 a.m. , capturing six of Crawford 's sentries posted in the north . One Royalist sentry , however , managed to raise the alarm just before dawn , leading Crawford and his horse to quit Alton and head for Winchester at a gallop , as Waller approached the town . It is reported that they had promised the remaining infantry men that they would return soon with reinforcements . Initially , Crawford and his cavalry attempted to flee from the eastern border of Alton , but were routed back into town and to the south ( heading directly for Winchester ) by Parliamentary horse . The fleeing Royalists were chased for a half-mile by Waller 's heavy cavalry ( these under Sir Arthur Haslerig and nicknamed the \" Lobsters \" ) , losing a few men and some number of horses . Haslerig , forfeiting pursuit , guarded the entrances to the town . Meanwhile , Boles 's men concentrated to the north-west corner of town , before the Church of St Lawrence . A regiment of Waller 's infantry , five companies of Haslerig 's , and five companies of Kentish Men attacked Alton from the north and north-west . The Royalist infantry , however , took effective cover inside buildings , out of which they fired quickly ; they particularly favoured a large brick house near the church . This house , however , was soon abandoned as Waller 's artillery , positioned at the foot of the hill to the west , fired upon it , forcing these defenders to retreat to the church . The Parliamentary regiments from London and four companies from Farnham Castle descended the hill : Waller 's Red Regiment attacked a lunette and breastwork which the Royalists had built and which they were using as an effective fortification . The Green Regiment flanked the Royalists which were behind these fortifications forcing them out , while marching through town under the cover of smoke from a thatch house which they had set on fire . Soon after , the rest of Waller 's men entered the town en masse , flying their colours and pushing Boles 's men back to the Church of St Lawrence . From the church and nearby fortifications ( including a large earthwork on its north side ) , the Royalists held their ground for two hours . The Royalists fired from the windows of the church , and employed a scaffolding inside the church proper to fire from greater heights . Eventually , the Parliamentarians forced the Royalists to abandon the south-east part of the wall around the church . However , since the retreating men had left their muskets sticking up , the Parliamentarians were temporarily unaware that the Royalists had left . After some time it was concluded that the defenders had gone , and the Parliamentary army promptly attacked the churchyard , driving the last of Boles 's men into the church itself . Waller 's forces threw hand grenades into the windows while working to enter the church themselves . Inside the building , Boles declared he would , \" run his sword through him which first called for quarter . \" There had been no time for the Royalists to barricade the church doors , and the Parliamentarians soon managed to gain entry . Inside , the Royalists shot from behind a jury-rigged breastwork of dead horses . Some of Boles 's men were killed ; other surrendered . Boles did not give up , and he killed as many as seven men before being killed himself . With Boles killed , all but a few of the Royalists requested quarter . Inscribed in Boles 's honour was this epitaph : Alton will tell you of that famous Fight Which ys man made , and bade this world good-night . His Vertious Life fear 'd not Mortality , His body must , his Vertues cannot die , Because his Bloud was there so nobly spent , This is his Tombe ; that Church his Monument . Ricardus Boles , Wiltoniensis in Art . Mag . Composuit Posuitque Dolens . An . Domi 1679 . = = Aftermath = = During and after the battle , Waller captured at least 500 men , around 100 of these re-enlisting with him . Additionally , more than 100 Royalist soldiers were killed . Together , the men lost represented nearly half of Hopton 's infantry forces in the south . Waller , on the other hand , lost around ten men and gained much reputation for his success . Waller put his prisoners to work dragging the horse carcasses from the church , dismantling the scaffoldings inside , and burying their fallen comrades near the northern wall of the building . All of the captured men were then marched to Farnham tied together in pairs . Waller ordered his men to demolish the town 's fortifications , and had survivors that did not re-enlist paraded through the streets of London to mark his victory . Crawford 's hat , cloak and gifted wine were all left behind in Alton . From then on , it was said that Crawford , in fleeing , \" left his sack at Alton \" . King Charles , upon hearing of Boles 's death , called for a mourning scarf , lamenting at the loss of what he considered to be one of \" the best Commanders in this Kingdome \" . In the following weeks , letters were sent from Crawford and Hopton to Waller : Sir , your servant , Crawford Winton , 16 December . Ralf Hopton . Hopton was severely depressed by his defeat at Alton , more than seemed appropriate given its military import . On the Parliamentarian side , the morale boost enjoyed by Waller was significant , and on 15 December , the House of Commons of England ordered Sir Arthur Haslerig and Sir Gilbert Gerard to draft a letter to Waller commending him for his success . The Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Alton allowed Waller to advance south-east , and upon Arundel where he began a successful siege on the Royalists garrisoned there . Hopton was unable to break the siege with his few remaining foot soldiers , and the 1,000 horse he received from Oxford were unhelpful . After the Siege of Arundel , both armies were forced to retire for the winter due to the harsh weather .",
                "Battle of Roat\u00e1n = The Battle of Roat\u00e1n ( sometimes spelled \" Rattan \" ) was an American War of Independence battle fought on March 16 , 1782 , between British and Spanish forces for control of Roat\u00e1n , an island off the Caribbean coast of present-day Honduras . A Spanish expeditionary force under Mat\u00edas de G\u00e1lvez , the Captain General of Spanish Guatemala , gained control of the British-held island after bombarding its main defences . The British garrison surrendered the next day . The Spanish evacuated the captured soldiers , 135 civilians and 300 slaves , and destroyed their settlement , which they claimed had been used as a base for piracy and privateering . The assault was part of a larger plan by G\u00e1lvez to eliminate British influence in Central America . Although he met with temporary successes , the British were able to maintain a colonial presence in the area . = = Background = = Following the entry of Spain into the American War of Independence in 1779 , both Spain and Great Britain contested territories in Central America . Although most of the territory was part of the Spanish Captaincy General of Guatemala , the British had established logging rights on the southern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula ( present-day Belize ) , and had established informal settlements ( lacking formal colonial authority ) on the Mosquito Coast of present-day Honduras and Nicaragua . Guatemalan Governor Mat\u00edas de G\u00e1lvez had moved quickly when the declaration of war arrived , seizing St. George 's Caye , one of the principal British island settlements off the Yucatan coast . Many of the British fled that occupation to the island of Roat\u00e1n , another British-controlled island about 40 miles ( 64 km ) off the Honduran coast . British commander Edward Marcus Despard used Roat\u00e1n as a base for guerilla-style operations to extend and maintain British influence on the Mosquito Coast , and for privateering operations against Spanish shipping . ( Sources do not indicate whether Despard was present on Roat\u00e1n at the time of the Spanish attack ; if he was , he was probably not captured , since he continued to be active in the area . Stephens suggests that he was on Jamaica at the time . ) G\u00e1lvez , who had been ordered by King Charles to \" dislocate the English from their hidden settlements on the Gulf of Honduras \" , began planning offensive operations against the British mainland settlements as early as 1780 , after the British abandoned their failed expedition into Nicaragua . He raised as many as 15,000 militia , and received financial and logistical support from many parts of the Spanish colonial empire in the Americas . For logistical and diplomatic reasons , no operations were launched until after the American victory at Yorktown in October 1781 . The British loss opened the possibility that the British would be able to deploy troops to Central America to better defend the area . G\u00e1lvez ' plans called for assaults on the British presence in the Bay Islands ( principally Roat\u00e1n ) , followed by a sweep along the coast to eliminate the British from the mainland . Troops from central Guatemala were staged in early 1782 at Trujillo for the assault on Roat\u00e1n , while additional forces moved overland from Nicaragua , Honduras , and Salvador toward the principal British settlement of Black River . G\u00e1lvez arrived at Trujillo on March 8 to organise the assault on Roat\u00e1n . Leaving a force of 600 at Trujillo to further harass the British and their partisan allies , he embarked another 600 troops onto transports , and sailed for Roat\u00e1n on March 12 , escorted by three frigates ( Santa Matilde , the Santa Cecilia , and the Antiope ) and a number of smaller armed naval vessels , under the command of Commodore Enrique Macdonell . The British residents of Roat\u00e1n were aware of the ongoing Spanish military activities . The main settlement , New Port Royal , was defended by Forts Dalling and Despard , which mounted 20 guns . The island 's white non-slave population was however quite small . In 1781 they appealed to the British commander at Bluefields for support , but he was only able to send additional weapons , which did not add significantly to the island 's defenses . = = Battle = = The Spanish fleet arrived off Roat\u00e1n early on March 13 , and , after its defenders fired several ineffectual cannon shots , anchored out of range while G\u00e1lvez sent a party in to request the surrender of the island 's defenders . The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options , which G\u00e1lvez granted . After that time had elapsed , the defenders indicated that they were prepared to stand their ground , and refused to surrender . Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas , so G\u00e1lvez then held council , and a plan of attack was formulated . At about 10 : 15 am on March 16 , Spanish guns opened up against Forts Dalling and Despard , which guarded the mouth of New Port Royal 's harbour . By 1 : 00 pm the British guns there had been silenced , and Major General Gabriel Herbias began landing troops . After the two forts were secured , the Spanish warships entered the harbour and began raking the town with cannon fire , while British artillery fired back from positions in the hills above the town . This exchange continued until sunset , at which point the British defenders capitulated . The Spanish had two killed and four wounded in the battle , while only two slaves were wounded on the other side . = = Aftermath = = Terms of surrender were agreed the next day . G\u00e1lvez and his men remained on the island for several days , collecting weapons , rounding up slaves that had run away , destroying all the buildings and agriculture on the island , as well as burning many of the ships in the harbour , which they assumed to be used in smuggling and other illicit trade . The Spanish left the island on March 23 , carrying as prisoners of war 81 British soldiers , 300 slaves , and 135 British civilians . The prisoners were sent to Havana , where the slaves were auctioned off and the others held until they could be exchanged . G\u00e1lvez was able to only temporarily partially eliminate British influences in the area . He followed up his success at Roat\u00e1n with the capture of Black River in early April , but any attempt to advance further bogged down . James Lawrie , the commander at Black River , and Edward Marcus Despard successfully recaptured Black River , and were able to hold it until the end of the war .",
                "Battle of White Plains = The Battle of White Plains was a battle in the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War fought on October 28 , 1776 , near White Plains , New York . Following the retreat of George Washington 's Continental Army northward from New York City , British General William Howe landed troops in Westchester County , intending to cut off Washington 's escape route . Alerted to this move , Washington retreated farther , establishing a position in the village of White Plains but failed to establish firm control over local high ground . Howe 's troops drove Washington 's troops from a hill near the village ; following this loss , Washington ordered the Americans to retreat farther north . Later British movements chased Washington across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania . Washington then crossed the Delaware and surprised a brigade of Hessian troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton . = = Background = = British General William Howe , after evacuating Boston in March 1776 , regrouped in Halifax , Nova Scotia , and embarked in June on a campaign to gain control of New York City . The campaign began with an unopposed landing on Staten Island in early July . British troops made another unopposed landing on Long Island on August 22 , south of the areas where General George Washington 's Continental Army had organized significant defenses around Brooklyn Heights . After losing the Battle of Long Island on August 27 , General Washington and his army of 9,000 troops escaped on the night of August 29 \u2013 30 to York Island ( as Manhattan was then called ) . General Howe followed up with a landing on Manhattan on September 15 , but his advance was checked the next day at Harlem Heights . After an abortive landing at Throg 's Neck , he landed troops with some resistance at Pell 's Point on October 18 to begin an encircling maneuver that was intended to trap Washington 's army between that force , his troops in Manhattan , and the Hudson River , which was dominated by warships of the Royal Navy . Howe established a camp at New Rochelle , but advance elements of his army were near Mamaroneck , only 7 miles ( 11 km ) from White Plains , where there was a lightly defended Continental Army supply depot . = = Prelude = = On October 20 , General Washington sent Colonel Rufus Putnam out on a reconnaissance mission from his camp at Harlem Heights . Putnam discovered the general placement of the British troop locations and recognized the danger to the army and its supplies . When he reported this to Washington that evening , Washington immediately dispatched Putnam with orders to Lord Stirling , whose troops were furthest north , to immediately march to White Plains . They arrived at White Plains at 9 am on October 21 , and were followed by other units of the army as the day progressed . Washington decided to withdraw most of the army to White Plains , leaving a garrison of 1,200 men under Nathanael Greene to defend Fort Washington on Manhattan . General Howe 's army advanced slowly , with troops from his center and right moving along the road from New Rochelle to White Plains , while a unit of Loyalists occupied Mamaroneck . The latter was attacked that night by a detachment of Lord Stirling 's troops under John Haslet , who took more than thirty prisoners as well as supplies , but suffered several killed and 15 wounded . As a result , Howe moved elements of his right wing to occupy Mamaroneck . On October 22 , Howe was reinforced by the landing at New Rochelle of an additional 8,000 troops under the command of Wilhelm von Knyphausen . Washington established his headquarters at the Elijah Miller House in North White Plains on October 23 , and chose a defensive position that he fortified with two lines of entrenchments . The trenches were situated on raised terrain , protected on the right by the swampy ground near the Bronx River , with steeper hills further back as a place of retreat . The American defenses were 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) long . Beyond that , on the right , was Chatterton 's Hill , which commanded the plain over which the British would have to advance . The hill was initially occupied by militia companies numbering several hundred , probably including John Brooks ' Massachusetts militia company . On October 24 and 25 , Howe 's army moved from New Rochelle to Scarsdale , where they established a camp covering the eastern bank of the Bronx River . This move was apparently made in the hopes of catching Charles Lee 's column , which had to alter its route toward White Plains and execute a forced march at night to avoid them . Howe remained at Scarsdale until the morning of October 28 , when his forces marched toward White Plains , with British troops on the right under General Henry Clinton , and primarily Hessian troops on the left under General von Heister . = = Battle = = While Washington was inspecting the terrain to determine where it was best to station his troops , messengers alerted him that the British were advancing . Returning to his headquarters , he ordered the 2nd Connecticut Regiment under Joseph Spencer out to slow the British advance , and sent Haslet and the 1st Delaware Regiment , along with Alexander McDougall 's brigade ( Rudolphus Ritzema 's 3rd New York Regiment , Charles Webb 's 19th Continental Regiment , William Smallwood 's 1st Maryland Regiment , and the 1st New York Regiment and 2nd New York Regiments ) to reinforce Chatterton Hill . Spencer 's force crossed the Bronx River , set up behind a stone wall , and exchanged fire with the Hessians led by Colonel Johann Rall that were at the head of the British left column . Eventually forced to retreat when Clinton 's column threatened their flank , these companies retreated across the Bronx River , while fire from the troops on Chatterton Hill covered their move . Rall 's troops attempted to gain the hill , but were repelled by fire from Haslet 's troops and the militia , and retreated to a nearby hilltop on the same side of the river . This concerted defense brought the entire British Army , which was maneuvering as if to attack the entire American line , to a stop . While Howe and his command conferred , the Hessian artillery on the left opened fire on the hilltop position , where they succeeded in driving the militia into a panicked retreat . The arrival of McDougall and his brigade helped to rally them , and a defensive line was established , with the militia on the right and the Continentals arrayed along the top of the hill . Howe finally issued orders , and while most of his army waited , a detachment of British and Hessian troops was sent to take the hill . The British attack was organized with Hessian regiments leading the assault . Rall was to charge the American right , while a Hessian battalion under Colonel Carl von Donop ( consisting of the Linsing , Mingerode , Lengereck , and Kochler grenadiers , and Donop 's own chasseur regiment ) was to attack the center . A British column under General Alexander Leslie ( consisting of the 5th , 28th , 35th , and 49th Foot ) was to attack the right . Donop 's force either had difficulty crossing the river , or was reluctant to do so , and elements of the British force were the first to cross the river . Rall 's charge scattered the militia on the American right , leaving the flank of the Maryland and New York regiments exposed as they poured musket fire onto the British attackers , which temporarily halted the British advance . The exposure of their flank caused them to begin a fighting retreat , which progressively forced the remainder of the American line , which had engaged with the other segments of the British force , to give way and retreat . Haslet 's Delaware regiment , which anchored the American left , provided covering fire while the remaining troops retreated to the north , and were the last to leave the hill . The fighting was intense , and both sides suffered significant casualties before the Continentals made a disciplined retreat . = = Casualties = = John Fortescue 's History of the British Army says that Howe 's casualties numbered 214 British and 99 Hessians . However , Rodney Atwood points out that Fortescue 's figure for the Hessians includes the entire Hessian casualties from 19 \u2013 28 October and that in fact only 53 of these casualties were incurred at the Battle of White Plains . This revised figure would give a total of 267 British and Hessians killed , wounded or missing at White Plains . Henry Dawson , on the other hand , gives Howe 's loss as 47 killed , 182 wounded and 4 missing . The American loss is uncertain . Theodore Savas and J. David Dameron give a range of 150-500 killed , wounded and captured . Samuel Roads numbers the casualties of 47 killed and 70 wounded . Henry Dawson estimates 50 killed , 150 wounded and 17 missing for McDougall 's and Spencer 's commands but has no information on the losses in Haslet 's regiment . = = Aftermath = = The two generals remained where they were for two days , while Howe reinforced the position on Chatterton Hill , and Washington organized his army for retreat into the hills . With the arrival of additional Hessian and Waldeck troops under Lord Percy on October 30 , Howe planned to act against the Americans the following day . However , a heavy rain fell the whole next day , and when Howe was finally prepared to act , he awoke to find that Washington had again eluded his grasp . Washington withdrew his army into the hills to the north on the night of October 31 , establishing a camp near North Castle . Howe chose not to follow , instead attempting without success to draw Washington out . On November 5 , he turned his army south to finish evicting Continental Army troops from Manhattan , a task he accomplished with the November 16 Battle of Fort Washington . Washington eventually crossed the Hudson River at Peekskill with most of his army , leaving New England regiments behind to guard supply stores and important river crossings . Later , British movements chased him across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania , and the British established a chain of outposts across New Jersey . Washington , seeing an opportunity for a victory to boost the nation 's morale , crossed the Delaware and surprised Rall 's troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton . = = Legacy = = Each year on or near the anniversary date , the White Plains Historical Society hosts a commemoration of the event at the Jacob Purdy House in White Plains , New York . Two ships in the United States Navy were named for the Battle of White Plains . CVE-66 was an escort carrier in World War II . AFS-4 was a combat stores ship that was decommissioned in 1995 after suffering extensive damage in 1992 's Typhoon Omar . According to some historians , the Headless Horseman depicted in Washington Irving 's short story \" The Legend of Sleepy Hollow \" was inspired by a real-life Hessian soldier who lost his head by cannon fire during this battle .",
                "Pyrrhus ' invasion of the Peloponnese = Pyrrhus ' invasion of the Peloponnese in 272 BC was an invasion of south Greece by Pyrrhus , King of Epirus . He was opposed by Macedon and a coalition of Greek city-states ( poleis ) , most notably Sparta . The war ended in a joint victory by Macedonia and Sparta . After being defeated by the Roman Republic in the Pyrrhic War in 275 BC , Pyrrhus ( r . 297 \u2013 272 BC ) decided to turn his attention to Greece . He declared war on Antigonus Gonatas ( r . 283 \u2013 239 BC ) of Macedon and in a rapid campaign , managed to defeat him and make himself king of Macedon . In 272 BC , Pyrrhus agreed to assist the disgruntled Spartan prince , Cleonymus , who requested his assistance in securing the Spartan throne . Pyrrhus advanced with his army through central Greece and upon reaching the Peloponnese , he marched against Sparta . The city was sparsely defended at the time as the majority of its army had been taken to Crete by King Areus I ( r . 309 \u2013 265 BC ) . The Spartans led by Crown Prince Acrotatus were able to withstand a series of Epiriote assaults until Macedonian reinforcements and Areus ' army arrived to relieve the defenders . Following the arrival of the relieving force , Pyrrhus lifted the siege and prepared to winter in Laconia . However , he was approached by an Argive citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of Argos . Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity , Antigonus took his army to Argos , being harried along the way by the Spartans . Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night , Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus ' Macedonians . In the ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e , Pyrrhus was slain . His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece . = = Prelude = = Following entreaties from the Greek polis of Tarentum in 281 BC , Pyrrhus , the king of Epirus in northern Greece , invaded Italy with an army of 25,500 and 20 war elephants . The aim of the expedition was to combat the aggression of the Roman Republic , which was increasingly annexing the Greek cities of Magna Graecia . Upon arriving in Italy in 280 BC , Pyrrhus assumed command of an army consisting of the Greeks of Magna Graecia . Adding these forces to his own from Epirus , he engaged and defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea , near Tarentum in 280 BC . The Epiriote victory caused a number of native groups such as the Samnites and the Lucanians , who were also fearful of Roman expansionism to join Pyrrhus . Subsequently , Pyrrhus advanced towards Rome and at the Battle of Asculum he vanquished another Roman army . Despite having bested the Romans in their battles , Pyrrhus had sustained heavy casualties . With his Italian allies wavering , Pyrrhus decided to abandon his campaign against Rome . At this point in time , Pyrrhus had two options available . Firstly , he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant by the death of King Ptolemy Keraunos at the hands of the Gallic invaders of Greece . Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC . Alternatively , he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression . Ultimately , in 278 BC , Pyrrhus decided to direct his army against the Carthaginians in Sicily . Pyrrhus was highly successful in his campaign against Carthage and by 275 BC had managed to restrict them to the settlement of Lilybaeum in the far west of the island . Despite these victories , Pyrrhus ' despotic disposition and pretensions alienated his Sicilian allies who began to abandon him . In light of these developments , Pyrrhus decided to return to mainland Italy to continue his war against Rome . The Epiriotes attacked the Roman army but after the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum , he returned to Epirus . Despite Pyrrhus leaving a garrison there , Tarentum succumbed to Rome in 272 BC . = = War against Macedon = = On his return to his homeland , Pyrrhus found himself in a difficult position . His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army , leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment . In order to secure funds to pay his troops , Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas , the new king of Macedon . Citing Antigonus ' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli , Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC . He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries . It has been speculated that by invading Macedon , Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt , Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II , however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely . Initially , Pyrrhus had simply viewed his incursion into Macedon as an opportunity to plunder . However , the capture of numerous towns and the defection to his side of 2,000 Macedonian soldiers caused him to make his objective the seizure of the Macedonian throne . Antignous marched with his army to western Macedon and was confronted by Pyrrhus at the Battle of the Aous . Pyrrhus began the engagements by slaughtering Antigonus ' Gallic rearguard before securing the surrender of the Macedonian war elephants . Demoralised by these sudden reverses , the Macedonian phalangites responded to Pyrrhus ' appeals and defected to the Epiriote side . Abandoned by his army , Antigonus managed to escape to Thessaloniki with a small force of cavalry . He was able to entrench himself there , protected by his strong navy which enabled him to maintain links with his possessions in southern Greece . Antigonus ' flight left Pyrrhus in complete control of the Macedonian hinterland and Thessaly in central Greece . However , not all of Macedon surrendered to the Epiriote king and he was compelled to send his general , the Spartan Prince Cleonymus to capture Edessa . Despite initially being welcomed with enthusiasm by the Macedonians , he managed to alienate his new subjects when his Gallic troops ransacked the royal Macedonian tombs at Vergina . By late 274 BC or early 273 BC , Pyrrhus secured the occupation of Macedonia and returned to Epirus , leaving his son Ptolemy to govern the region . = = Advance into the Peloponnese = = Following his Macedonian triumph , Pyrrhus was approached by his officer Cleonymus . The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland . Cleonymus ' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold . Firstly , he was angry that he had been overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew , Areus II . Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus ' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature . Furthermore , Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife , Chilonis , was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus , the son of Areus . Pyrrhus ' motivation for agreeing to assist Cleonymus is more complex . By installing Cleonymus on the throne , the Epiriote would secure Sparta as an ally . Additionally , by invading the Peloponnese , Pyrrhus would be able to subdue any cities which had remained loyal to Antigonus . In doing so , he could prevent Antigonus using the peninsula as a base from which to launch a counter-attack on Macedon . The size of the force assembled by Pyrrhus is indicative of his intention to extend his hegemony into the Peloponnese . The Epiriote king mustered an army consisting of 25,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry as well as 24 war elephants . In 272 BC , Pyrrhus marched his army through Central Greece to the city of Pleuron from where they were ferried across the Gulf of Corinth to the Peloponnese . This suggests that the invasion was supported by the Aetolian League , a powerful confederate in Central Greece which was allied with Pyrrhus and hostile to Antigonus . Antigonus attempted to exploit Pyrrhus ' absence from Macedon by launching an invasion to reclaim his kingdom . However , his attack on Macedon was unsuccessful as he was defeated in battle by Pyrrhus ' son , Ptolemy . Unperturbed by Antigonus ' offensive , Pyrrhus advanced into the Peloponnese where he was welcomed in Achaia . The Epiriote army marched to Megalopolis , a central Peloponnesian city which lay on the border with Sparta . Several of Sparta 's neighbours , namely Megalopolis , Elis and many of the Achaians poleis , supported Pyrrhus invasion as they would profit from the reduction of Spartan influence in the region . While his force was camped at Megalopolis , Pyrrhus received ambassadors from Messene , Athens , the Achaian League and Sparta . In response to the Spartans ' inquires as to the reasons for his Peloponnesian incursion , Pyrrhus managed to dupe the envoys . He told the Spartans that he had come to liberate any cities still held by Antigonus and that he hoped to send his sons to Sparta to obtain a traditional education at the agoge . However , when the emissaries returned to Sparta , Pyrrhus advanced into Laconia . He advanced south , following the course of the Eurotas River and ravaging the lands of the Spartan perioeci . It may have been at this time that Pyrrhus assigned Cleonymus a series of independent commands as he is recorded as subjugating the city of Alifeira in Elis as well as sacking Zarax in the Parnon region of Laconia . Pyrrhus ' perfidy was met with anger in Sparta and ambassadors were immediately sent to Pyrrhus to rebuke him . = = Siege of Sparta = = The Spartans were caught unawares by Pyrrhus ' invasion . Areus had taken the majority of the Spartan army with him to Crete , where he was campaigning on behalf of Gortyn at the request of Ptolemaic Egypt . The result was that the settlement was lightly defended . Arriving at Sparta as night fell , Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack the city immediately . However , the Epiriote declined to as he was fearful of the damage that would be wrought by Gallic troops if they entered the city at night and moreover expected the sparsely defended city to surrender in the morning . The Spartan council of Elders , the gerousia , suggested that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection . They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia , the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city 's defence . In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest , the women and the elderly began bolstering defences . Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him , the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance . Moreover , messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus , despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile . Pausanias , the Greek geographer , claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos . The Epiriotes launched their first assault against the city at daybreak . However , they were unable to get a firm footing because of the trench and were repulsed by the defenders , who were encouraged by the women . In order to circumvent this obstacle . Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and Chaonians commanded by Ptolemy to attempt to go around the trench . Finding their path blocked by the wagons , they began to pulling them out of the ground . Aware of the danger , Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into the trench after inflicting heavy casualties upon them . Unable to make an impact on the defences , Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall . After receiving a favourable omen during the night Pyrrhus renewed his assault . An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded . In an attempt to nullify the Spartans ' advantage , the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta . Responding to this Spartan counter-attack , Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city , spreading panic amongst the defenders . However , at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly . Pyrrhus ' fall threw his companions into a state of dismay , permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles . Despite this , Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp . Prompted by this unsuccessful foray , Pyrrhus order his army to return to its camp . He now expected the Spartans seek terms as the severity of their casualties would make the defence unsustainable . However , Sparta was saved by the arrival of unexpected reinforcements . In the interim , Antigonus had launched another offensive in northern Greece and succeeded in evicting Pyrrhus ' garrisons from Macedon ( this possibly accounts for the presence of Ptolemy in Pyrrhus ' army ) . Having reclaimed his kingdom , Antigonus moved south into the Peloponnese , probably using the sea route to avoid a confrontation with the Aetolian League . Upon his arrival in Corinth , he sent his general Ameinias the Phocian with a group of mercenaries to assist the Spartans . The arrival of the Macedonia mercenaries was closely followed by Areus ' return from Crete with 2,000 men . Enheartened by the arrival of these reinforcements , the defenders prepared to face Pyrrhus ' next assault . The Epiriotes launched an attack in the morning but after this was repelled Pyrrhus became convinced of the futility of the situation and ordered his men to lift the siege . = = March to Argos = = Pyrrhus retreated with his army into the Laconian hinterland with the purpose of wintering there before making another attempt against Sparta . However , as his troops were ravaging the surrounding countryside , he received news that Antigonus was marching on Argos from Corinth on his way to trap Pyrrhus in Laconia . Pyrrhus was approached by Aristeas , the leader of the democratic faction in Argos , who sought Epiriote support to counter the pro-Macedonian aristocratic party of Argos led by Aristippos . Accepting Aristeas ' proposal , Pyrrhus began his march north to the Argolis . Pyrrhus ' advance on Argos did not go smoothly as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus . By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat , the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus ' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians . In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear , Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command . Pyrrhus hoped that the presence of his son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable to him to extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing . Ptolemy 's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus . In the ensuing struggle , Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout . The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry . Upon hearing of his son 's death and the collapse of his rearguard , Pyrrhus summoned his Molossian cavalry and charged the Spartans . In the battle that followed , Pyrrhus killed the Spartan leader Evaclus with his own hand and succeeded in annihilating the pursuing Spartan troops . After this skirmish , the Epiriotes continued their march to Argos . However , upon reaching his destination , he found that Antigonus had arrived at Argos first and camped to the city 's north . The Macedonian presence compelled Pyrrhus to pitch camp at Nauplion to the south of Argos . Pyrrhus attempted to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched battle on the plain in front of Argos but the Macedonian king was unmoved . The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings , beseeching them to respect the city 's neutrality . Antigonus agreed to the Argives ' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity . While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos , he failed to give a pledge and as a result was regarded with suspicion . = = Battle of Argos = = During the night , Pyrrhus was able to enter Argos . While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force , Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas . Hammond opines that it is more likely that Aristeas admitted Pyrrhus into the city . Although Pyrrhus ' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora , the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate . In order for them to enter , the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city . Furthermore , Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus . This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel , the Aspis , and seek aid from Antigonus . The Macedonian king responded immediately , advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus . The situation further deteriorated for Pyrrhus when Areus entered Argos with a force of 1,000 lightly armed Cretans and Spartans . The Argives , assisted by their Spartan and Macedonian allies , launched a counter-attack on Pyrrhus ' Gallic troops in the agora and threw them into a state of panic . Due to the labyrinthine layout of the city and the darkness , both Pyrrhus ' advancing troops and those of his opponents become scattered throughout Argos . The result was that Pyrrhus , entering the city at the head of his cavalry to assist the Gauls , was unable to effectively communicate his commands to his soldiers . Realising the difficulty of his situation , Pyrrhus ordered his army to retreat from Argos as day broke . Understanding that the gates were too narrow for his army to exit in an orderly fashion , Pyrrhus ordered Helenus to tear down part of the wall and to be prepared to fend off any enemy counter-attacks against the retreating troops . However , the instructions brought by the messenger were unclear and instead of organising the retreat , Helenus advanced with the rest of the army into Argos . With the majority of his troops streaming in through the gates , Pyrrhus ' line of retreat was blocked off . The disorder was exacerbated when Pyrrhus ' largest elephant fell and blocked the gateway and another elephant started running amok after his mahout was felled . The weight of the enemy 's assault pushed Pyrrhus and his troops from the agora and compelled them to fight in the narrow street leading to the Diamperes Gate . In the fighting which ensued , Pyrrhus was wounded by a spear wielded by an Argive . As Pyrrhus turned to strike down his assailant , he was hit on the head by a roof tile thrown by his attacker 's mother . Pyrrhus was either killed by the force of the tile 's impact or , alternately , having fallen dazed from his horse he was decapitated by one of Antigonus ' Macedonian soldiers , Zopyrus . Pyrrhus ' head was brought by Halcyoneus to Antigonus , who expressed dismay when he saw it and upbraided his son for acting in such a barbarous manner . Upon Pyrrhus ' death , Epiriote resistance crumbled and Antigonus accepted the surrender of Helenus , giving him Pyrrhus ' body for burial . = = Aftermath = = The expedition into the Peloponnese was a disaster for Epiriote ambitions . Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus to return to his homeland with the remainder of his army , Epirus ceased to be a regional power . Pyrrhus ' son and successor , Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king . Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus ' conquests of Tymphaea , Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon . Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north . Antigonus emerged from the conflict as the unchallenged ruler of Macedon and the leading power in Greece . After his victory in Argos , Antigonus was able to install his supporter Aristippos as tyrant of the city and appointed various pro-Macedonian leaders as tyrants in other Greek cities . His support for tyrants over democratic rulers would lead to growing resentment amongst the Greek cities against Macedon . On his journey north to Macedon , Antigonus succeeded in placing garrisons in the cities of Chalcis and Eretria on the important island of Euboia with the outcome being that he further consolidated his power in Greece . The Spartan-Macedon alliance proved to be transient . Angered by Macedon 's supremacy and full of ambition , Areus formed a coalition with several Greek poleis , most notably Athens . In the resulting Chremonidean War , Areus was slain by his former ally Antigonus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC . The war ended in a defeat that was so crushing for Sparta that it would not rise as a regional power again until the reign of Cleomenes III thirty years later . = = = Ancient sources = = = Pausanias ; Jones , W.

                    "text": "Battle of Fort Cumberland = The Battle of Fort Cumberland ( also known as the Eddy Rebellion ) was an attempt by a small number of militia commanded by Jonathan Eddy to bring the American Revolutionary War to Nova Scotia in late 1776 . With minimal logistical support from Massachusetts and four to five hundred volunteer militia and Natives , Eddy attempted to besiege and storm Fort Cumberland in central Nova Scotia ( near the present-day border between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick ) in November 1776 . The fort 's defenders , the Royal Fencible American Regiment led by Joseph Goreham , a veteran of the French and Indian War , successfully repelled several attempts by Eddy 's militia to storm the fort , and the siege was ultimately relieved when the RFA plus Royal Marine reinforcements drove off the besiegers on November 29 . In retaliation for the role of locals who supported the siege , numerous homes and farms were destroyed , and Patriot sympathizers were driven out of the area . The successful defense of Fort Cumberland preserved the territorial integrity of the British Maritime possessions , and Nova Scotia remained loyal throughout the war . = = Background = = Nova Scotia was generally poorly defended in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War , and unrest in the eastern regions provoked fears of an American-led uprising . Although some reinforcements had reached Halifax by early 1776 , the frontiers of the province were only lightly defended . Fort Cumberland was located on the Isthmus of Chignecto , which connects modern mainland Nova Scotia with New Brunswick . The area was strategically important in earlier conflicts between the French colony of Acadia and British-controlled Nova Scotia . Originally built by the French in 1750 as Fort Beaus\u00e9jour , Fort Cumberland was in deplorable condition . Won from the French in the Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour in 1755 , the fortifications had been minimally garrisoned by the British after the Seven Years ' War and abandoned in 1768 . As early as June 1775 , Colonel Joseph Goreham had been ordered by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia for the defense of the province against Patriot activity . Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776 , Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition . But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms . Furthermore , the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause , and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort , even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect . = = Discontent in Nova Scotia = = Jonathan Eddy was a Massachusetts-born resident of Cumberland County , Nova Scotia , where the fort was located . He and John Allan , both of whom served in the provincial assembly , were the prime movers of Patriot activity in the area , which was one of several hotbeds of agitation in Nova Scotia . The other major areas of Patriot activity were Maugerville in the St. John River valley of Sunbury County ( present-day New Brunswick ) , and Cobequid , and there were also pockets of activity in Pictou and the Passamaquoddy Bay area , which separates present-day Maine and New Brunswick . Patriots in these communities were in contact with each other , and those of Cumberland and Maugerville were active in trying to interest nearby natives ( Passamaquoddy , Maliseet , and Mi 'kmaq ) in their cause . Eddy believed that with military assistance from the Thirteen Colonies , he might be able to bring down the strongly Loyalist administration of Nova Scotia . Early in 1776 , Eddy went to Massachusetts in an attempt to interest political and military leaders there in supporting action in Nova Scotia , while Allan worked to raise interest in Nova Scotia . Allan 's work was made more difficult by the arrival of Colonel Goreham and his troops to refortify Fort Cumberland , and by the activities of Michael Francklin , a former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and a vocal Loyalist . Eddy returned empty-handed to Nova Scotia in June 1776 , only to learn that Goreham had put a price on his head . The activities of Goreham 's Fencibles in the Cumberland area were successful enough that Patriot activities there were effectively forced underground ; the center of these activities was shifted to Maugerville in part as a consequence of this . Goreham , a veteran of the French and Indian War , was also able to blunt Patriot inroads in the native communities , where the Mi 'kmaq refused to take sides , and the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy , at first supportive of the Patriots , ultimately did not turn out in the numbers Eddy had hoped for or been promised . Eddy returned to Massachusetts in August . While the Second Continental Congress and George Washington would not authorize , fund , or otherwise support military activities in Nova Scotia , Eddy was able to convince the Massachusetts Provincial Congress to provide some material support ( primarily muskets , ammunition , powder , and other military supplies ) for an attempt on Fort Cumberland . It also allowed Eddy to engage in recruiting in the District of Maine . = = Raising the militia = = Eddy left Boston in September and sailed to Machias , where he recruited about 20 men . On October 13 , this party sailed from Machias for Passamaquoddy Bay . Coincidentally , John Allan , who was working on a longer-term plan for military action , sailed from Campobello Island for Machias the same day . The two parties met at sea , where Allan attempted to dissuade Eddy from his plan , informing him that the Mi 'kmaq ( the largest tribe in Nova Scotia ) would not help him . Allan extracted a promise from Eddy to wait at Campobello while he went to Machias to meet with the council there . When the Machias council learned of how little native support there was , they sent a letter to Eddy urging him to give up the effort . Eddy persisted , and left Campobello , having added nine Passamaquoddy recruits to his band . From Campobello , Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville , where 27 men were recruited , and then up to the Maliseet settlement at Aukpaque ( just upriver from present-day Fredericton ) . There he learned the bad news that Pierre Tomah , the main Maliseet chief , was not interested in taking up the hatchet . Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin , one of Tomah 's competitors , and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families of those men . In another disappointment , none of the local Acadians joined , contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area . = = Prelude = = With a force now numbering about 72 , Eddy sailed up the Bay of Fundy to Shepody Outpost . The exact location of this outpost , established probably by Joseph Goreham in September , is subject to debate . It may have been present-day Hopewell Cape , New Brunswick on the Bay 's western side , or it may have been Fort Folly Point on its eastern side . In any case , it was there that Eddy captured a patrol of Goreham 's Fencibles on October 25 , killing one and wounding another . The prisoners were shipped back to Machias , and Eddy sent some of his men to Cocagne in a largely fruitless effort to enlist Mi 'kmaqs in the cause . Eddy himself continued on to Memramcook , where about two dozen of the Acadian locals joined him . This enlarged force marched to Sackville , where more settlers joined the force , swelling it ( by Eddy 's account ) to about 180 men . Goreham was finally alerted to Eddy 's actions on November 4 , when a boat sent with supplies for the Shepody patrol was informed of Eddy 's activities by locals . Goreham heightened the guard on the fort , but did not immediately attempt to notify Halifax or Windsor , since he was uncertain what routes away from the fort might have been blocked by Eddy . On October 31 , the frigate Juno escorted the supply sloop Polly to Fort Cumberland , where she docked below the fort on the Aulac River . The Polly was laden with supplies to last the fort through the winter , and work began immediately to unload those supplies . Juno , easily visible from Sackville , was a concern to Eddy , since her presence added to the fort 's defenses . Fortunately for Eddy , she sailed on November 3 , leaving Polly docked below the fort . On November 6 , Eddy 's patrols began ranging closer to the fort , alerting Goreham to the approaching force . Goreham took no additional steps to protect the Polly , and any attempts to get word of his predicament out were again delayed by his decision to await the return of scouts he had dispatched earlier . ( The fate of the scouts is uncertain ; they did not return before the fort was invested . ) That evening , thirty of Eddy 's men surprised the sleepy guards aboard the Polly , taking thirteen prisoners . They also seized another ship , owned by a Patriot sympathizer , that happened to be anchored nearby . On the morning of November 7 Goreham decided that it was time to get a message to Windsor . He sent a party of men down to the dock that morning . These men , numbering about 30 , were taken prisoner by Eddy 's men as rapidly as they arrived due to their unawareness that Eddy had control of the ship . The Polly was then sailed to Fort Lawrence , to the east of Fort Cumberland , where the supplies were landed . Sentries in the fort spotted the move , and Goreham , realizing Eddy had taken the ship , fired an ineffectual cannonade against the ship . = = Siege = = Goreham took stock of his situation . Nearly one quarter of his garrison ( more than 60 men ) had been captured by Eddy , along with critical fuel and other supplies that had not been unloaded from the Polly before her seizure . His defenses consisted of a hastily constructed palisade that encompassed most of the fort , and six cannons , for which his men had only completed three mounts . The fort 's military complement was 176 men , including officers and artillerymen . Over the next few days , local militia arrived to raise the garrison 's size to about 200 , although this included individuals not effective for combat due to illness . On both November 7 and 8 he again attempted to get messengers out of Eddy 's cordon , without success . On November 8 Eddy was joined by about 200 men from Cobequid and Pictou , and he finally felt ready to act on November 10 . Eddy sent a letter demanding that Goreham surrender his garrison . Goreham refused , suggesting in retort that Eddy surrender . The next day authorities outside the area learned of Eddy 's activities . Michael Francklin , patrolling in the Bay of Fundy for privateers , recovered a ferry that had been taken , and learned from its passengers that Eddy was active . When the news reached Halifax through the efforts of Thomas Dixson , Lieutenant Governor Marriot Arbuthnot responded by dispatching orders on the 15th for any available ship based at Annapolis to go to Fort Edward in Windsor , to convoy troops to relieve the siege . Commodore Sir George Collier had previously dispatched the HMS Vulture into the Bay of Fundy on rumors of privateering activity there , so he ordered the HMS Hope to locate the Vulture so that she could assist . However , the Hope captured a prize and returned to Halifax ; she was then sent out again to accompany a supply ship to Fort Cumberland . In the meantime , the Vulture fortuitously arrived at Windsor , where she took on some marines and Fencibles . Lacking artillery , the rebels attempted to storm the fort on the night of November 12 , attempting a feint to draw Goreham 's strength away from the weak points of the defenses . The experienced Goreham saw through the feint and repulsed the attack . One of Eddy 's Maliseet warriors sneaked into the fort and very nearly opened a gate but was stopped at the last moment . Following the failed attack , Eddy effectively lost control of the expedition , as a council of leaders formed against him . Night attacks ordered by the council on November 22 and 23 succeeded in capturing and burning several buildings , but Goreham grimly held his ground , and the invaders were again repulsed . On November 27 , the Vulture arrived . Rather than retreat in the face of arriving relief , the rebels increased their guard ; Goreham , with some intelligence about the size of the force opposing him , planned a sortie . Early on the morning of November 29 , Major Thomas Batt led 150 men from the Vulture 's Royal Marine contingent and the Royal Fencible Americans , and scattered Eddy 's men , killing and wounding several , at the cost of two dead and three wounded . = = Aftermath = = Batt 's men chased Eddy 's , but bad weather and the lack of adequate footwear eventually caused him to call off the pursuit . Eddy 's forces scattered , with many retreating overland to Maugerville . Some of the Massachusetts men took more than two months to reach Machias . Homes and farms of rebel supporters were burned in reprisal but British authorities took a lenient approach toward captured rebels , including Richard John Uniacke , who went on to become Attorney General of Nova Scotia . Goreham issued an offer of pardon for those who would surrender their arms , which more than 100 locals accepted . This prompted Major Batt to file charges against Goreham for neglect of duty ; Goreham was exonerated . The victory at Fort Cumberland strengthened the British presence in Nova Scotia , in part by driving Patriot sympathizers like Allan and Eddy out of the province , but also by cowing those that remained , often by requiring people to make pledges to the Crown . Some unrest continued for the remainder of the war ( e.g. , the Battle at Miramichi ) , although no further large scale military threat occurred . The most significant attempt occurred in the summer of 1777 , when John Allan was authorized by Congress to take actions in Nova Scotia ; however , only a small number of forces were raised for this effort at Saint John , and a British show of force put an end to the attempt . Eddy appears to have been involved with Allan 's work , but his movements prior to August 1777 are uncertain . Commodore Collier followed up by attacking Machias , intending to break Allan 's plans . Eddy led the defense of Machias during the battle on August 13 \u2013 15 , 1777 . ( Collier 's action was in fact unnecessary ; the Massachusetts Provisional Congress had in early August voted to disband forces recruited for Allan 's expedition , because of the imminent threat posed by the army of General John Burgoyne in upstate New York . ) The Battle of Fort Cumberland was poorly documented in 19th-century histories of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , often receiving only minimal mention . The involvement of local inhabitants ( natives , Acadians , and English-speakers ) in the siege was generally understated or unknown . The site of Fort Cumberland has been preserved as a National Historic Site of Canada , and is administered by Parks Canada .",

The battle , which began on 13 September 1759 , was fought by the British Army and Navy against the French Army on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City , on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin , hence the name of the battle . The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides , but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France , influencing the later creation of Canada . The culmination of a three-month siege by the British , the battle lasted about 15 minutes . British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadien militia under General Louis-Joseph , Marquis de Montcalm , employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts . Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle ; Wolfe received three gunshot wounds that ended his life within minutes of the beginning of the engagement and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs . In the wake of the battle , the French evacuated the city ; their remaining military force in Canada and the rest of North America came under increasing pressure from British forces . While the French forces continued to fight and prevailed in several battles after Quebec was captured , the British did not relinquish their hold on the virtually impregnable Citadelle . That tenacity carried over to other areas in North America ; within four years , France ceded most of its possessions in eastern North America to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris . The decisive success of the British forces and the subsequent capture of Quebec City formed part of what became known as the \" Annus Mirabilis \" in Great Britain . = = Overview = = As the Seven Years ' War entered its later stages through 1758 and 1759 , French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attacks from British armies . In 1758 after defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon , the British took Louisbourg in August , causing Atlantic Canada to fall into British hands , and opening the sea route to attack Quebec . Fort Frontenac fell to the British in the same month , costing the French supplies for the Ohio Valley campaign . When some of the Indian supporters of the French made peace with the British , France was forced to draw its troops back . French leadership , specifically Governor de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm , were unsettled by the British successes . However , Quebec was still able to protect itself as the British prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759 . James Wolfe expected to lead 12,000 men , but was greeted by only approximately 400 officers , 7,000 regular troops , and 300 gunners . Wolfe 's troops were supported by a fleet of 49 ships and 140 smaller craft led by Admiral Charles Saunders . In preparation for the fleet 's approach to Quebec , James Cook surveyed a large portion of the river , including a dangerous channel known as The Traverse . Cook 's ship was one of the first ships up the river , sounding the channel and guiding the fleet as it moved up , eventually landing Wolfe and his men on the \u00cele d 'Orl\u00e9ans on 28 June . The French attempted to attack the fleet by sending seven fire ships downriver to disrupt the landing , but the ships fired too early and British sailors in longboats were able to pull the flaming craft clear of the fleet . The following day , Wolfe 's troops landed on the south bank of the river at Point Levis , nearly directly across the river from Quebec ; an artillery battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by bombardment . Despite an air of defeatism among the leadership , the professional French troops and New French militia defenders focused preparations for the British attacks on the Beauport Shore . Montcalm and his staff , Major-General Fran\u00e7ois de Gaston , Chevalier de L\u00e9vis , Colonel Louis Antoine de Bougainville , and Lieutenant-Colonel de Sennezergue , distributed some 12,000 troops in a nine-kilometre-long collection of fortified redoubts and batteries from the Saint-Charles River to the Montmorency Falls , along the shallows of the river in areas that had previously been targeted by British attempts to land . Prior to the arrival of the British , a small fleet of supply ships had arrived in Quebec with much needed supplies . Those supplies , along with 500 reinforcements , were likely behind the lengthened siege . Wolfe , on surveying the town of Beauport , found that the houses there had been barricaded and organized to allow for musket fire from within ; they were built in an unbroken line along the road , providing a formidable barrier . In addition , a screen of trees along the Montmorency River made an approach on that route dangerous . On 31 July , the first serious attempt by Wolfe 's troops to land on the northern shore led to the Battle of Beauport , also known as the Battle of Montmorency . Approximately 3,500 troops , supported by a heavy bombardment , attempted to land , but were caught under fire in the river shallows . Members of the Louisbourg Grenadiers , who reached the beach , attempted a generally undisciplined charge on the French positions , but came under heavy fire ; a thunderstorm ended the fight and allowed Wolfe to pull his troops back after taking some 450 casualties to Montcalm 's 60 . Some French officers felt the Montmorency defeat would be the last British attack ; Vaudreuil wrote afterwards that \" I have no more anxiety about Quebec . Wolfe , I assure you , will make no progress \u2026 He contented himself with losing about five hundred of his best soldiers . \" He predicted another attack would come within days . Others in the French camp felt the campaign was over . For the remainder of the summer , Wolfe 's focus changed , possibly due to frustration with Montcalm 's tactics . His troops , along with American Rangers , attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence . An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed , and many colonists killed . The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm 's army out of its fortifications , but was unsuccessful . However , the attacks did reduce the amount of supplies available to the French , especially as the British navy , unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely , was successfully blockading the ports in France . = = Preparations = = Through the summer siege , illness spread through the British camps . In August , Wolfe himself was bedridden , causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops . With many men in camp hospitals , British fighting numbers were thinned , and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed by the end of September , or Britain 's opportunity would be lost . In addition , his frustration with Montcalm 's defensive stance continued to grow . In a letter to his mother , Wolfe wrote , \" The Marquis of Montcalm is at the head of a great number of bad soldiers , and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him ; but the wary old fellow avoids an action , doubtful of the behaviour of his army . \" Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege , relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted , and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack . After considering and rejecting a number of plans for landings on the north shore , a decision was made in late August by Wolfe and his brigadiers to land upriver of the city . If successful , such a landing would force Montcalm to fight , as a British force on the north shore of the St. Lawrence would cut his supply lines to Montreal . Initial suggestions for landing sites ranged as far as 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) up the St. Lawrence , which would have given the French troops one or two days to prepare for the attack . Following the failed British assault on Montmorency , Montcalm altered his deployment , sending Bougainville and a column of approximately 1,500 regular troops , 200 cavalry , and a group of New French militia \u2014 some 3,000 men in all \u2014 upriver to Cap-Rouge to monitor the British ships upstream . He further strengthened his defences of the Beauport shore following the abandonment of the British camp at Montmorency , which he regarded as preparations for a descent ( amphibious attack ) on Beauport . In spite of warnings from local commanders , he did not view an upstream landing as a serious possibility . The British , meanwhile , prepared for their risky deployment upstream . Troops had already been aboard landing ships and drifting up and down the river for several days when Wolfe on 12 September , made a final decision on the British landing site , selecting L 'Anse-au-Foulon . L 'Anse-au-Foulon is a cove situated southwest of the city , three kilometres upstream from Cap Diamant . It lies at the bottom of a 53-metre ( 174 ft ) high cliff leading to the plateau above , and was protected by a battery of guns . It is not known why Wolfe selected Foulon , as the original landing site was to be further up the river , in a position where the British would be able to develop a foothold and strike at Bougainville 's force to draw Montcalm out of Quebec and onto the plains . Brigadier-General George Townshend wrote that \" by some intelligence the General had , he has changed his mind as to the place he intended to land . \" In his final letter , dated HMS Sutherland , 8 : 30 p.m. 12 September , Wolfe wrote : Wolfe 's plan of attack depended on secrecy and surprise . His plan required that a small party of men should land by night on the north shore , climb the tall cliff , seize a small road , and overpower the garrison that protected it , allowing the bulk of his army ( 5,000 men ) to ascend the cliff by the small road and then deploy for battle on the plateau . Even if the first landing party succeeded in their mission and the army was able to follow , such a deployment would still leave his forces inside the French line of defense with no immediate retreat but the river . It is possible that Wolfe 's decision to change the landing site was owing less to a desire for secrecy and more to his general disdain for his brigadiers ( a feeling that was reciprocated ) ; it is also possible that he was still suffering the effects of his illness and the opiates he used as painkillers . Anderson believes Wolfe ordered the attack believing the advanced guard would be repulsed , and anticipated dying gallantly with his men rather than returning home in disgrace . = = Landing = = Bougainville , tasked with the defence of the large area between Cap Diamant and Cap Rouge , was upstream with his troops at Cap Rouge on the night of 12 September , and missed seeing numerous British ships moving downstream . A camp of approximately 100 militia led by Captain Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor , who had unsuccessfully faced the British four years previously at Fort Beaus\u00e9jour , had been assigned to watch the narrow road at L 'Anse-au-Foulon which followed a streambank , the Coul\u00e9e Saint-Denis . On the night of 12 September and morning of 13 September , however , the camp may have contained as few as 40 men , as others were off harvesting . Vaudreuil and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of L 'Anse-au-Foulon being vulnerable , but Montcalm dismissed them , saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight , remarking , \" It is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that they can in the same night cross the river , disembark , climb the obstructed acclivity , and scale the walls , for which last operation they would have to carry ladders . \" Sentries did detect boats moving along the river that morning , but they were expecting a French supply convoy to pass that night \u2014 a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified . When the boats , loaded with the first wave of British troops , were challenged , a French-speaking officer , either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders , was able to answer the challenge in excellent French , allaying suspicion . The boats , however , had drifted slightly off course : instead of landing at the base of the road , many soldiers found themselves at the base of a slope . A group of 24 volunteers led by Colonel William Howe with fixed bayonets were sent to clear the picket along the road , and climbed the slope , a manoeuvre that allowed them to come up behind Vergor 's camp and capture it quickly . Wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain . Thus , by the time the sun rose over the Plains of Abraham , Wolfe 's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs . = = Battle = = The plateau was undefended save for Vergor 's camp , as Vaudreuil had ordered one of the French regiments to relocate to the east of the city not long before the landing . Had the immediate defenders been more numerous , the British might have been unable to deploy or even been pushed back . An officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to on the night of the 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame . The first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from Vergor 's camp , but one of Montcalm 's aides felt the man was mad and sent him away , then went back to bed . Saunders had staged a diversionary action off Montmorency , firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops , many of them taken from field hospitals ; this preoccupied Montcalm . Montcalm was taken aback to learn of the British deployment , and his response has been regarded as precipitate . Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville 's column ( allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position ) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces , or even yielded the city to Wolfe , he instead elected to confront Wolfe 's force directly . Had he waited , the British would have been entirely cut off \u2014 they had nowhere to go but back down the Foulon , and would have been under fire the entire way . To an artillery officer named Montbelliard , Montcalm explained his decision thus : \" We cannot avoid action ; the enemy is entrenching , he already has two pieces of cannon . If we give him time to establish himself , we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have . \" = = = First engagements = = = In total , Montcalm had 13,390 regular troops , Troupes de la Marine , and militia available in Quebec City and along the Beauport shore , as well as 200 cavalry , 200 artillery ( including the guns of Quebec ) , 300 native warriors ( including many Odawa under Charles de Langlade ) , and 140 Acadian volunteers , but most of these troops did not participate in the action . Many of the militia were inexperienced ; the Acadian , Canadian , and indigenous irregulars were more used to guerilla warfare . By contrast , the British troops were almost all regulars . On the morning of 13 September , Wolfe 's army formed a line first with their backs to the river , then spread out across the Plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River . While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec , the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank , sheltering in the trees and scrub ; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River . The British troops , numbering approximately 3,300 , formed into a shallow horseshoe formation that stretched across the width of the Plains , the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long . In order to cover the entire plain , Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep , rather than the more conventional three ranks . On the left wing , regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line . The defenders pushed the British from one house , but were repelled and , in retreat , lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands . Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left , and may have confused Montcalm as to the width of the lines . As Wolfe 's men waited for the defenders , the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush . As French troops arrived from Beauport , Montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the British from their position . Accordingly , he deployed the forces immediately available in and near Quebec City and prepared an immediate attack , without waiting for further reinforcements from the Beauport shore . He arrayed his approximately 3,500 soldiers into place , his best regulars three deep , others six deep and his poorest regiment in column . At approximately 10 a.m. , Montcalm , riding his dark horse and waving his sword to encourage his men , ordered a general advance on the British line . As a European-trained military leader , Montcalm 's instinct was for large , set-piece battles in which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order . Such actions required a disciplined soldiery , painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground , trained to march in time , change formation at a word , and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys . Though his regular regiments ( the \" troupes de terre \" or \" metropolitans \" ) were adept at such formal warfare , in the course of the campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen , whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual : they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload , thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range . = = = Battle on the plains = = = As the French approached , the British lines held their fire . Wolfe had devised a firing method for stopping French column advances in 1755 that called for the centre \u2014 in this case , the 43rd and 47th Foot regiments \u2014 to hold fire while waiting for the advancing force to approach within 30 yards ( 27 m ) , then open fire at close range . The French held their fire and both armies waited for two or three minutes . The French finally fired two disorganized volleys . Wolfe had ordered his soldiers to charge their muskets with two balls each in preparation for the engagement . Captain John Knox , serving with the 43rd Foot , wrote in his journal that as the French came within range , the regiments \" gave them , with great calmness , as remarkable a close and heavy discharge as I ever saw . \" After the first volley , the British lines marched forward a few paces towards the shocked French force and fired a second general volley that shattered the attackers and sent them into retreat . Wolfe , positioned with the 28th Foot and the Louisbourg Grenadiers , had moved to a rise to observe the battle ; he had been struck in the wrist early in the fight , but had wrapped the injury and continued on . Volunteer James Henderson , with the Louisbourg Grenadiers , had been tasked with holding the hill , and reported afterwards that within moments of the command to fire , Wolfe was struck with two shots , one low in the stomach and the second , a mortal wound in the chest . Knox wrote that one of the soldiers near Wolfe shouted \" They run , see how they run . \" Wolfe , on the ground , opened his eyes and asked who was running . Upon being told that the French had broken , he gave several orders , then turned on his side and said \" Now , God be praised , I will die in peace \" , and died . With Wolfe dead and several other key officers injured , British troops fell into a disorganised pursuit of the retreating French troops . The 78th Fraser Highlanders were ordered by Brigadier-General James Murray to pursue the French with their swords , but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a floating battery covering the bridge over the St. Charles River as well as militia that remained in the trees . The 78th took the highest number of casualties of all British units in the battle . An eyewitness with the 78th Highlanders ( Dr. Robert Macpherson ) wrote three days after the battle : The Highlanders pursued them to the very Sally Port of the town . The Highlanders returned towards the main body . When the highlanders were gathered together , they lay 'd on a separate attack against a large body of Canadians on our flank that were posted in a small village and a Bush of woods . Here , after a wonderful escape all day , we suffered great loss both in Officers and men but at last drove them under the cover of their cannon which likeways did us considerable loss . \" Townshend took charge of the British forces and realised that Bougainville 's column was approaching from the British rear , having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge . He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming French , a day-saving manoeuvre ; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force , Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm 's army slipped back across the St. Charles . During the retreat , Montcalm , still mounted , was struck by either canister shot from the British artillery or repeated musket fire , suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh . He was able to make it back into the city , but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning . He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell . The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties on both sides of the field ; the French had 644 men killed or injured , while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded . = = Aftermath = = In the wake of the battle , a state of confusion spread through the French troops . Governor de Vaudreuil , who later wrote to his government and put the full blame for the French rout on the deceased Montcalm , decided to abandon Quebec and the Beauport shore , ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with Bougainville , leaving the garrison in Quebec under the command of Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay . Meanwhile , the British , first under the command of Townshend and later with Murray in charge , settled in to besiege the city in conjunction with Saunders ' fleet . Within days , on 18 September , de Ramezay , Townshend and Saunders signed the Articles of Capitulation of Quebec and the city was turned over to British control . The remaining French forces positioned themselves on the Jacques-Cartier River west of the city . The British Navy was forced to leave the St. Lawrence shortly after the capture of Quebec due to pack ice closing the mouth of the river . Before the ice left the rivers in April , the Chevalier de L\u00e9vis , Montcalm 's successor as French commander , marched his 7,000 troops to Quebec . James Murray , the British commander , had experienced a terrible winter , in which scurvy had reduced his garrison to only 4,000 . On 28 April 1760 , L\u00e9vis ' forces met and defeated the British at the Battle of Sainte-Foy , immediately west of the city ( near the site of Universit\u00e9 Laval today ) . This battle proved bloodier than that of the Plains of Abraham , with about 850 casualties on the French side and 1,100 on the British side . The British were defeated in the battle , but were able to withdraw within the walls of Quebec , which was now under siege . A lack of artillery and ammunition , combined with British improvements to the fortifications , meant that the French were unable to take the city before the arrival of the British fleet in mid-May which defeated Levis ' support ships . A naval battle fought at Quiberon Bay , just off the coast of France , proved the decisive battle for this part of New France . The Royal Navy destroyed the French fleet , meaning France could not send a reserve force to save New France . The success of the French army 's offensive against Quebec in the spring of 1760 had depended on the dispatch of a French armada , with fresh troops and supplies . At Montr\u00e9al that September , L\u00e9vis and 2,000 troops were confronted with 17,000 British and American troops . The French capitulated on 8 September 1760 , and the British took possession of Montreal . The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763 to end the war and gave possession of parts of New France to Great Britain , including Canada and the eastern half of French Louisiana \u2014 lying between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains . = = Legacy of the Plains = = Today , while much of the foreshore along the base of the cliffs that were scaled by William Howe 's men the morning of the battle has been taken over by industry , the Plains of Abraham themselves are preserved within one of Canada 's National Urban Parks . There is a monument on the site of the Battle of Sainte-Foy . In 2009 , a number of activities were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham . A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself ( as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy ) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder . Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a slap in the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority . Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place , there could be violence . The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event . Another commemorative event was proposed for the anniversary , the Moulin \u00e0 paroles . Thousands gathered on the Plains of Abraham to listen to recitations of 140 significant texts from Quebec history , including the 1970 FLQ Manifesto . The inclusion of that document in the event led to condemnations and a boycott from federalist politicians and the withdrawal of some government funding for the event . The Moulin \u00e0 paroles took place without incident .",

                    "text": "Hans-Joachim Marseille = Hans-Joachim Marseille ( 13 December 1919 \u2013 30 September 1942 ; German pronunciation : [ hants jo\u02c8a\u03c7\u026am m\u0251r\u02c8se\u026a ] ) was a Luftwaffe fighter pilot and flying ace during World War II . He is noted for his aerial battles during the North African Campaign and his Bohemian lifestyle . One of the most successful fighter pilots , he was nicknamed the \" Star of Africa \" . Marseille claimed all but seven of his \" official \" 158 victories against the British Commonwealth 's Desert Air Force over North Africa , flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter for his entire combat career . No other pilot claimed as many Western Allied aircraft as Marseille . Marseille , of French Huguenot ancestry , joined the Luftwaffe in 1938 . At the age of 20 he graduated from one of the Luftwaffe 's fighter pilot schools just in time to participate in the Battle of Britain , without notable success . A charming person , he had such a busy night life that sometimes he was too tired to be allowed to fly the next morning . As a result , he was transferred to another unit , which relocated to North Africa in April 1941 . Under the guidance of his new commander , who recognised the latent potential in the young officer , Marseille quickly developed his abilities as a fighter pilot . He reached the zenith of his fighter pilot career on 1 September 1942 , when during the course of three combat sorties he claimed 17 enemy fighters shot down , earning him the Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub , Schwertern und Brillanten ( Knight 's Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords , and Diamonds ) . Only 29 days later , Marseille was killed in a flying accident , when he was forced to abandon his fighter due to engine failure . After he exited the smoke-filled cockpit , Marseille 's chest struck the vertical stabiliser of his aircraft . The blow either killed him instantly or incapacitated him so that he was unable to open his parachute . = = Early life = = Hans-Joachim \" Jochen \" Walter Rudolf Siegfried Marseille was born to Charlotte ( maiden name : Charlotte Marie Johanna Pauline Gertrud Riemer ) and Hauptmann Siegfried Georg Martin Marseille , a family with paternal Huguenot ancestry , in Berlin-Charlottenburg Berliner Strasse 164 on 13 December 1919 at 11 : 45 pm . As a child , he was physically weak , and he nearly died from a serious case of Influenza . His father Siegfried was an Army officer during World War I , and later left the armed forces to join the Berlin Police force . Siegfried later rejoined the Army in 1933 , and was promoted to General in 1935 . Promoted again he attained the rank of Generalmajor on 1 July 1941 . He served on the Eastern Front from the beginning of Operation Barbarossa . Siegfried Marseille was killed by partisans near Pyetrykaw on 29 January 1944 . He was buried in the cemetery of Selasje . Hans-Joachim also had a younger sister , Ingeborg \" Inge \" . While on sick leave in Athens at the end of December 1941 , he was summoned to Berlin by a telegram from his mother . Upon arriving home , he learned his sister had been \" slain by a jealous lover \" ; Hans-Joachim never recovered emotionally from this blow . When Marseille was still a young child his parents divorced and his mother subsequently married a police official named Reuter . Marseille initially assumed the name of his stepfather at school ( a matter he had a difficult time accepting ) but he reverted to his father 's name of Marseille in adulthood . He acquired the reputation of being a rebel from a lack of discipline , a characteristic that would plague him early on in his Luftwaffe career . Marseille also had a difficult relationship with his natural father whom he refused to visit in Hamburg for some time after the divorce . Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father , who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that was to initially hamper his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe . However , the rapproachment with his father did not last and he did not see him again thereafter . Marseille attended the 12th Volksschule Berlin ( 1926 \u2013 1930 ) , and from the age of 10 , the Prinz Heinrich Gymnasium in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg ( 1930 \u2013 1938 ) . He was considered to be a lazy student at first , and was constantly playing pranks and getting into trouble . Toward the end of his school years he started to take his education more seriously and qualified as one of the youngest ( at 17 years , six months ) to achieve his Abitur , graduating in early 1938 . Marseille then expressed his desire to become a \" flying officer . \" = = = Entry into the Luftwaffe = = = Although not athletic in physique , Marseille received a good report for a term with the Reichsarbeitsdienst ( \" State Labour Service \" ) Abtlg . 1 / 177 in Osterholz-Scharmbeck near Bremen , between 4 April and 24 September 1938 . He joined Luftwaffe on 7 November 1938 , as a Fahnenjunker ( officer candidate ) and received his military basic training in Quedlinburg in the Harz region . On 1 March 1939 Marseille was transferred to the Luftkriegsschule 4 ( LKS 4 \u2014 air war school ) near F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck . Among his classmates was Werner Schr\u00f6er . Schr\u00f6er reports that Marseille was often in breach of military discipline . Consequently Marseille was ordered to stay on base while his class mates were on weekend leave . Quite frequently Marseille ignored this and left Schr\u00f6er a note : \" Went out ! Please take my chores . \" On one occasion , while performing a slow circuit , Marseille broke away and performed an imaginary weaving dogfight . He was reprimanded by his commanding officer , Hauptmann Mueller-Rohrmoser , and taken off flying duties and his promotion to Gefreiter postponed . Soon after , during a cross-country flight , he landed on a quiet stretch of Autobahn ( between Magdeburg and Braunschweig ) and ran behind a tree to relieve himself . Some farmers came to enquire if he needed assistance , but by the time they arrived Marseille was on his way , and they were blown back by his slipstream . Infuriated , the farmers reported the matter and Marseille was again suspended from flying . Those he graduated with had been made full officers by early 1940 , while Marseille 's indiscipline left him with the rank of Oberf\u00e4hnrich at the end of 1941 . Marseille completed his training at Jagdfliegerschule 5 ( 5th fighter pilot school ) in Wien-Schwechat to which he was posted on 1 November 1939 . Jagdfliegerschule 5 at the time was under the command of the World War I flying ace and recipient of the Pour le M\u00e9rite Eduard Ritter von Schleich . One of his teachers at the Jagdfliegerschule 5 was the Austro-Hungarian World War I ace Julius Arigi . Marseille graduated from Jagdfliegerschule 5 with an outstanding evaluation on 18 July 1940 and was assigned to Erg\u00e4nzungsjagdgruppe Merseburg . Marseille 's unit was assigned to air defence duty over the Leuna plant from the outbreak of war until the fall of France . On 10 August 1940 he was assigned to I. Jagd / Lehrgeschwader 2 , based in Calais-Marck , to begin operations over Britain and again received an outstanding evaluation this time by his Hauptmann and Gruppenkommandeur , Herbert Ihlefeld . = = World War II = = = = = Battle of Britain = = = In his first dogfight over England on 24 August 1940 , Marseille was involved in a four-minute battle with a skilled opponent . He defeated his opponent by pulling up into a tight chandelle , to gain an altitude advantage before diving and firing . The British fighter was struck in the engine , pitching over and diving into the English Channel ; this was Marseille 's first victory . Marseille was then engaged from above by more enemy fighters . By pushing his aircraft into a steep dive then pulling up metres above the water , Marseille escaped from the machine gun fire of his opponents : \" skipping away over the waves , I made a clean break . No one followed me and I returned to Leeuwarden [ sic \u2014 Marseille was based near Calais , not Leeuwarden ] . \" Marseille did not take any pleasure in this victory and found it difficult to accept the realities of aerial combat . On his second sortie , he scored another victory , and by the 15 September 1940 , had claimed his fourth victory . Marseille became an ace on 18 September after claiming a fifth enemy aircraft . While returning from a bomber-escort mission on 23 September 1940 flying Werk Nummer ( W.Nr ) 5094 , his engine failed 10 miles off Cap Gris Nez after combat damage sustained over Dover . Pilot Officer George Bennions from 41 Squadron may have shot Marseille down . According to another source , W.Nr 5094 was destroyed in this engagement by Robert Stanford Tuck , who had pursued a Bf 109 to that location and whose pilot was rescued by a He 59 naval aircraft . Marseille is the only German airman known to have been rescued by a He 59 on that day and in that location . Tuck 's official claim was for a Bf 109 destroyed off Griz Nez at 09 : 45 \u2014 the only pilot to submit a claim in that location . Marseille tried to radio his position but was forced to bail out over the sea . He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude . Severely worn out and suffering from exposure , he was sent to a field hospital . I. ( Jagd ) / LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day . Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield . He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapit\u00e4n Adolf Buhl , who was shot down and killed . He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld , during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on . Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille . Because of his alienation of other pilots , his arrogance and unapologetic nature , Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2 . Another account recalled how Marseille once ignored an order to turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one , but seeing an enemy aircraft closing on his wing leader , Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down . Expecting nothing but \" a well done Jochen \" when he landed , he was thoroughly criticised for his actions , receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order . Days later , Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole F\u00e4hnrich in the Geschwader . This was a humiliation for him , suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air . Shortly afterwards , in early October 1940 , after having claimed seven aerial victories all them flying with I. ( Jagd ) / LG 2 Marseille was transferred to 4 . / Jagdgeschwader 52 , flying alongside the likes of Johannes Steinhoff and Gerhard Barkhorn . He wrote off four aircraft as a result of operations during this period . Steinhoff , later recalled : \" Marseille was extremely handsome . He was a very gifted pilot , but he was unreliable . He had girl friends everywhere , and they kept him so busy that he was sometimes so worn out that he had to be grounded . His sometime irresponsible way of conducting his duties was the main reason I fired him . But he had irresistible charm . \" As punishment for \" insubordination \" \u2014 rumoured to be his penchant for American jazz music , womanising and an overt \" playboy \" lifestyle \u2014 and inability to fly as a wingman , Steinhoff transferred Marseille to Jagdgeschwader 27 on 24 December 1940 . When he joined his new unit , it was difficult to foresee his outstanding career . His new Gruppenkommandeur , Eduard Neumann , later recalled , \" His hair was too long and he brought with him a list of disciplinary punishments as long as your arm . He was tempestuous , temperamental and unruly . Thirty years later , he would have been called a playboy . \" Nevertheless , Neumann quickly recognised Marseille 's potential as a pilot . He stated in an interview : \" Marseille could only be one of two , either a disciplinary problem or a great fighter pilot . \" Jagdgeschwader 27 was soon relocated to North Africa . = = = Arrival in North Africa = = = Marseille 's unit briefly saw action during the invasion of Yugoslavia , deployed to Zagreb on 10 April 1941 , before transferring to Africa . On 20 April on his flight from Tripoli to his front airstrip Marseille 's Bf 109 developed engine trouble and he had to make a forced landing in the desert short of his destination . His squadron departed the scene after they had ensured that he had got down safely . Marseille continued his journey , first hitchhiking on an Italian truck , then , finding this too slow ; he tried his luck at an airstrip in vain . Finally he made his way to the general in charge of a supply depot on the main route to the front , and convinced him that he should be available for operations next day . Marseille 's character appealed to the general and he put at his disposal his own Opel Admiral , complete with chauffeur . \" You can pay me back by getting fifty victories , Marseille ! \" were his parting words . Nevertheless he caught up with his squadron and arrived on 21 April . He scored two more victories on 23 and 28 April , his first in the North African Campaign . However , on 23 April , Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis , a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF ( 8.5 victories ) , flying a Hawker Hurricane . Marseille 's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area , and three or four shattered the canopy . As Marseille was leaning forward the rounds missed him by inches . Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter . Just a month later , records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941 . Marseille engaged Denis , but overshot his target . A turning dogfight ensued , in which Denis once again bested Marseille . Neumann ( a Geschwaderkommodore as of 10 June 1942 ) encouraged Marseille to self-train to improve his abilities . By this time , he had crashed or damaged another four Bf 109E aircraft , including a tropicalised aircraft he was ferrying on 23 April 1941 . Marseille 's kill rate was low , and he went from June to August without a victory . He was further frustrated after damage forced him to land on two occasions : once on 14 June 1941 and again after he was hit by ground fire over Tobruk and was forced to land blind . His tactic of diving into enemy formations often found him under fire from all directions , resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair ; consequently , Eduard Neumann was losing his patience . Marseille persisted , and created a unique self-training programme for himself , both physical and tactical , which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness , marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft , but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target 's front from the side , instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind . Marseille often practiced these tactics on the way back from missions with his comrades . Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting . As Marseille began to claim enemy aircraft regularly , on occasion he would organise the welfare of the downed pilot personally , driving out to remote crash sites to rescue downed Allied airmen . On 13 September 1941 Marseille shot down Pat Byers of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) No. 451 Squadron . Marseille flew to Byers ' airfield and dropped a note informing the Australians of his condition and treatment . He returned several days later to second the first note with news of Byers ' death . Marseille repeated these sorties after being warned by Neumann that G\u00f6ring had forbade any more flights of this kind . After the war , Marseille 's JG 27 comrade Werner Schr\u00f6er stated that Marseille attempted these gestures as \" penance \" for a group that \" loved shooting down aircraft \" but not killing a man ; \" we tried to separate the two . Marseille allowed us that escape , our penance I suppose . \" Finally on 24 September 1941 , his practice came to fruition , with his first multiple victory sortie , claiming four Hurricanes of No. 1 Squadron , South African Air Force ( SAAF ) . By mid December , he had reached 25 victories and was duly awarded the German Cross in Gold . His Staffel was rotated to Germany in November / December 1941 to convert to the Bf 109F-4 / trop , the variant that was described as the Experten ( experts ) \" mount . \" These victories represented his 19 \u2013 23rd victory . = = = The \" Star of Africa \" = = = Marseille always strove to improve his abilities . He worked to strengthen his legs and abdominal muscles , to help him tolerate the extreme g forces of air combat . Marseille also drank an abnormal amount of milk and shunned sunglasses , to improve his eyesight . To counter German fighter attacks , the Allied pilots flew \" Lufbery circles \" ( in which each aircraft 's tail was covered by the friendly aircraft behind ) . The tactic was effective and dangerous as a pilot attacking this formation could find himself constantly in the sights of enemy pilots . Marseille often dived at high speed into the middle of these enemy defensive formations from either above or below , executing a tight turn and firing a two-second deflection shot to destroy an enemy aircraft . The successes Marseille had begun to become readily apparent in early 1942 . He claimed his 37 \u2013 40th victories on 8 February 1942 and 41 \u2013 44th victories four days later which earned him the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) that same month for 46 victories . Marseille attacked under conditions many considered unfavourable , but his marksmanship allowed him to make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target . Marseille 's excellent eyesight made it possible for him to spot the enemy before he was spotted , allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack . In combat , Marseille 's unorthodox methods led him to operate in a small leader / wingman unit , which he believed to be the safest and most effective way of fighting in the high-visibility conditions of the North African skies . Marseille \" worked \" alone in combat keeping his wingman at a safe distance so he would not collide or fire on him in error . In a dogfight , particularly when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle , Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps to reduce speed and shorten his turn radius , rather than the standard procedure of using full throttle throughout . Emil Clade said that none of the other pilots could do this effectively , preferring instead to dive on single opponents at speed so as to escape if anything went wrong . Clade said of Marseille 's tactics : Marseille developed his own special tactics , which differed significantly from the methods of most other pilots . ( When attacking a Lufbery circle ) he had to fly very slowly . He even took it to the point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down , because , of course he had to fly his curve ( turns ) more tightly than the upper defensive circle . He and his fighter were one unit , and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else . Friedrich K\u00f6rner ( 36 victories ) also recognised this as unique : \" Shooting in a curve ( deflection shooting ) is the most difficult thing a pilot can do . The enemy flies in a defensive circle , that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle . By pulling his aircraft right around , his curve radius must be smaller , but if he does that , his target disappears in most cases below his wings . So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct . \" His success as a fighter pilot also led to promotions and more responsibility as an officer . 1 May 1942 saw him receive an unusually early promotion to Oberleutnant followed by appointment to Staffelkapit\u00e4n of 3 . / JG 27 on 8 June 1942 , thus succeeding Oberleutnant Gerhard Homuth who took command of I. / JG 27 . In a conversation with his friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt , Marseille commented on his style , and his idea of air-to-air combat : I often experience combat as it should be . I see myself in the middle of a British [ sic ] swarm , firing from every position and never getting caught . Our aircraft are basic elements , Stahlschmidt , which have got to be mastered . You 've got to be able to shoot from any position . From left or right turns , out of a roll , on your back , whenever . Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics . Attack tactics , that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle \u2013 a series of unpredictable movements and actions , never the same , always stemming from the situation at hand . Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside . Marseille had a narrow escape on 13 May 1942 , when his Bf 109 was damaged during a dogfight with 12 Kittyhawks ( Mk I ) from No. 3 Squadron RAAF , southeast of Gazala and over the Gulf of Bomba ( \" Gazala Bay \" ) . With a wingman , Marseille bounced the Kittyhawks . After he downed one of the Australian pilots , Flying Officer Graham Pace in AL172 , Marseille 's Bf 109 took hits in the oil tank and propeller , likely from Flying Officer Geoff Chinchen ( 1919 \u2013 2005 ) , who reported damaging one of the Messerschmitts . Marseille nevertheless managed to shoot down another Kittyhawk ( Sergeant Colin McDiarmid ; AK855 ) , before nursing his overheating aircraft back to base . The repairs to Marseille 's Bf 109 took two days . The aerial victories were recorded as numbers 57 \u2013 58 . Weeks later , on 30 May , Marseille performed another mercy mission after witnessing his 65th victory \u2014 Pilot Officer Graham George Buckland of No. 250 Squadron RAF \u2014 strike the tail plane of his fighter and fall to his death when the parachute did not open . After landing he drove out to the crash site . The P-40 had landed over Allied lines but they found the dead pilot within German territory . Marseille marked his grave , collected his papers and verified his identity , then flew to Buckland 's airfield to deliver a letter of regret . Buckland died two days before his 21st birthday . His attack method to break up formations , which he perfected , resulted in a high proportion of kills , and in rapid , multiple victories per attack . On 3 June 1942 , Marseille attacked alone a formation of 16 Curtiss P-40 fighters and shot down six aircraft of No. 5 Squadron SAAF , five of them in six minutes , including three aces : Robin Pare ( six victories ) , Cecil Golding ( 6.5 victories ) and Andre Botha ( five victories ) . This success inflated his score further , recording his 70 \u2013 75th victories . Marseille was awarded the Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub on 6 June 1942 . His wingman Rainer P\u00f6ttgen , nicknamed Fliegendes Z\u00e4hlwerk the ( \" Flying Counting Machine \" ) , said of this fight : All the enemy were shot down by Marseille in a turning dogfight . As soon as he shot , he needed only to glance at the enemy plane . His pattern [ of gunfire ] began at the front , the engine 's nose , and consistently ended in the cockpit . How he was able to do this not even he could explain . With every dogfight he would throttle back as far as possible ; this enabled him to fly tighter turns . His expenditure of ammunition in this air battle was 360 rounds ( 60 per aircraft shot down ) . Schr\u00f6er , did however , place Marseille 's methods into context : He was the most amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw . He was also very lucky on many occasions . He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one , often alone , with us trying to catch up to him . He violated every cardinal rule of fighter combat . He abandoned all the rules . On 17 June 1942 , Marseille claimed his 100th aerial victory . He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark . Marseille then returned to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern . On 6 August , he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fianc\u00e9e Hanne-Lies K\u00fcpper . On 13 August , he met Benito Mussolini in Rome and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery , the Medaglia d 'Oro al Valor Militare . While in Italy Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report , submitted by the Gestapo head in Rome , Herbert Kappler . He was finally located . According to rumours he had run off with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded to return to his unit . Unusually , nothing was ever said about the incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion . Leaving his fianc\u00e9e in Rome , Marseille returned to combat duties on 23 August . 1 September 1942 was Marseille 's most successful day , destroying 17 enemy aircraft ( nos . 105 \u2013 121 ) , and September would see him claim 54 victories , his most productive month . The 17 enemy aircraft shot down included eight in 10 minutes ; as a result of this feat , he was presented with a Volkswagen K\u00fcbelwagen by a Regia Aeronautica squadron , on which his Italian comrades had painted \" Otto \" ( Italian language : Otto = eight ) . This was the most aircraft from Western Allied air forces shot down by a single pilot in one day . Only one pilot , Emil \" Bully \" Lang , on 4 November 1943 , would better this score , against the Soviet Air Force on the Eastern Front . On 3 September 1942 Marseille claimed six victories ( nos . 127 \u2013 132 ) but was hit by fire from the British-Canadian ace James Francis Edwards . Der Adler , a biweekly Nazi propaganda magazine published by the Luftwaffe , also reported his actions in volume 14 of 1942 . Three days later Edwards likely killed G\u00fcnter Steinhausen , a friend of Marseille . The next day , 7 September 1942 , another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action . These personal losses weighed heavily on Marseille 's mind along with his family tragedy . It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the last weeks of his life . The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and other symptoms that could be construed as posttraumatic stress disorder . Marseille never remembered these events . Marseille continued scoring multiple victories throughout September , including seven on 15 September ( nos . 145 \u2013 151 ) . Between 16 and 25 September , Marseille failed to increase his score due to a fractured arm , sustained in a force landing soon after the 15 September mission . As a result , he had been forbidden to fly by Eduard Neumann . But the same day , Marseille borrowed the Macchi C.202 ' 96 \u2013 10 ' of the Italian ace Tenente Emanuele Annoni , from 96a Squadriglia , 9 \u00b0 Gruppo , 4 \u00b0 Stormo , based at Fuka , for a test flight . But the one-off flight ended in a wheels-up landing , when the German ace accidentally switched the engine off , as the throttle control in Italian aircraft was opposite to that of the German aircraft . Marseille had nearly surpassed his friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt 's score of 59 victories in just five weeks . However , the massive material superiority of the Allies meant the strain placed on the outnumbered German pilots was now severe . At this time , the strength of German fighter units was 112 ( 65 serviceable ) aircraft against the British muster of some 800 machines . Marseille was becoming physically exhausted by the frenetic pace of combat . After his last combat on 26 September , Marseille was reportedly on the verge of collapse after a 15-minute battle with a formation of Spitfires , during which he scored his seventh victory of that day . Of particular note was Marseille 's 158th claim . After landing in the afternoon of the 26 September 1942 , he was physically exhausted . Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille 's physical state . Marseille , according to his own post-battle accounts , had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level . Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other . Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker . Finally , with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining , he climbed into the sun . The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare . Marseille executed a tight turn and roll , fired from 100 metres range . The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing . It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside . Marseille wrote , \" That was the toughest adversary I have ever had . His turns were fabulous ... I thought it would be my last fight \" . Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified . = = = Aircraft = = = The following Bf 109 E-7 aircraft are among those that Marseille flew : Werk Nummer ( W.Nr ) 3579 , sustained 50 % damage on 2 September 1940 in aerial combat and crash landed near Calais-Marck . W.Nr 5597 , sustained 75 % damage on 11 September 1940 in aerial combat and made an emergency landing near Wissant . W.Nr 5094 , sustained 100 % damage on 23 September 1940 Marseille bailed out after aerial combat near Dover . W.Nr 4091 , sustained 35 % damage on 28 September 1940 Marseille made an emergency landing after engine failure near Th\u00e9ville . W.Nr 1259 , sustained 80 % damage on 20 April 1941 Marseille made an emergency landing after engine failure near Cahela . W.Nr 5160 , sustained 100 % damage on 23 April 1941 Marseille made an emergency landing after combat and belly landing near Tobruk . W.Nr 1567 , sustained 40 % damage on 21 May 1941 in aerial combat and made an emergency landing near Tobruk . Marseille flew four different Bf 109F-4 / Z aircraft : Werk Nummer ( W.Nr ) 12593 , in which his score rose to 50 on 23 February 1942 W.Nr. 10059 , with 68 victory bars on the rudder . On 15 September 1942 this aircraft lost a wing in a midair collision when its pilot Leutnant Friedrich Hoffmann of 3 . / JG 27 collided with a Bf 109 piloted by Unteroffizier Heinrich Pein of 5 . / JG 27 .

The first six of these machines were to replace the Gruppe 's Bf 109Fs . All had been allocated to Marseille 's 3 Staffel . Marseille had previously ignored orders to use these new aircraft because of its high engine failure rate , but on the orders of Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring , Marseille reluctantly obeyed . One of these machines , WK-Nr. 14256 ( Engine : Daimler-Benz DB 605 A-1 , W.Nr. 77 411 ) , was to be the final aircraft Marseille flew . Over the next three days Marseille 's Staffel was rested and taken off flying duties . On 28 September Marseille received a telephone call from Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel asking to return with him to Berlin . Hitler was to make a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 30 September and Rommel and Marseille were to attend . Marseille rejected this offer , citing that he was needed at the front and had already taken three months ' vacation that year . Marseille also revealed he wanted to take leave at Christmas , to marry his fianc\u00e9e Hanne-Lies K\u00fcpper . On 30 September 1942 , Hauptmann Marseille was leading his Staffel on a Stuka escort mission , covering the withdrawal of the group and relieving the outward escort , III . / Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 ) , which had been deployed to support JG 27 in Africa . Marseille 's flight was vectored onto enemy aircraft in the vicinity but the enemy withdrew and did not take up combat . Marseille vectored the heading and height of the formation to Neumann who directed III . / JG 27 to engage . Marseille heard 8 . / JG 27 leader Werner Schr\u00f6er claim a Spitfire over the radio at 10 : 30 . While returning to base , his new Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 / trop 's cockpit began to fill with smoke ; blinded and half asphyxiated , he was guided back to German lines by his wingmen , Jost Schlang and Lt Rainer P\u00f6ttgen . Upon reaching friendly lines , \" Yellow 14 \" had lost power and was drifting lower and lower . P\u00f6ttgen called out after about 10 minutes that they had reached the White Mosque of Sidi Abdel Rahman , and were thus within friendly lines . At this point , Marseille deemed his aircraft no longer flyable and decided to bail out , his last words to his comrades being \" I 've got to get out now , I can 't stand it any longer \" . Eduard Neumann was personally directing the mission from the command post : I was at the command post and listening to the radio communication between the pilots . I realised immediately something serious had happened ; I knew they were still in flight and that they were trying to bring Marseille over the lines into our territory and that his aircraft was emitting a lot of smoke . His Staffel , which had been flying a tight formation around him , peeled away to give him the necessary room to manoeuvre . Marseille rolled his aircraft onto its back , the standard procedure for bail out , but due to the smoke and slight disorientation , he failed to notice that the aircraft had entered a steep dive ( at an angle of 70 \u2013 80 degrees ) and was now travelling at a considerably faster speed ( about 640 km / h ( 400 mph ) ) . He worked his way out of the cockpit and into the rushing air only to be carried backwards by the slipstream , the left side of his chest striking the vertical stabiliser of his fighter , either killing him instantly or rendering him unconscious to the point that he could not deploy his parachute . He fell almost vertically , hitting the desert floor 7 kilometres ( 4.3 mi ) south of Sidi Abdel Rahman . As it transpired , a gaping 40 cm ( 16 in ) hole had been made in his parachute and the canopy had spilled out , but after recovering the body , the parachute release handle was still on \" safe , \" revealing Marseille had not even attempted to open it . Whilst checking the body , Oberarzt Dr Bick , the regimental doctor for the 115th Panzergrenadier-Regiment , noted Marseille 's wristwatch had stopped at exactly 11 : 42 am . Dr. Bick had been the first to reach the crash site , having been stationed just to the rear of the forward mine defences , he had also witnessed Marseille 's fatal fall . In his autopsy report , Dr. Bick stated : \" The pilot lay on his stomach as if asleep . His arms were hidden beneath his body . As I came closer , I saw a pool of blood that had issued from the side of his crushed skull ; brain matter was exposed . I turned the dead pilot over onto his back and opened the zipper of his flight jacket , saw the Knight 's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Marseille never actually received the Diamonds personally ) and I knew immediately who this was . The paybook also told me . \" Oberleutnant Ludwig Franzisket collected the body from the desert . Hans-Joachim Marseille lay in state in the Staffel sick bay , his comrades coming to pay their respects throughout the day . As a tribute they put on the record \" Rhumba Azul \" that he had enjoyed listening to ; it played over and over until the close of day . Marseille 's funeral took place on 1 October 1942 at the Heroes Cemetery in Derna with Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring and Eduard Neumann delivering a eulogy . The last entry in his flight book by Eduard Neumann read : \" Flight duration 54 minutes , time of landing \" black cross \" . Took to parachute 7 kilometres ( 4.3 mi ) south of Sidi Abdel Rahman . Remarks : Engine damage . Flights 1 \u2013 482 , 388 combat flights and a total of 158 kills : Certified in the field 30 September 1942 \" . An enquiry into the crash was hastily set up . The commission 's report ( Aktenzeichen 52 , Br.B.Nr. 270 / 42 ) concluded that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear , which caused an oil leak . Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil . Sabotage or human error was ruled out . The aircraft , W. Nr. 14256 , was ferried to the unit via Bari , Italy . The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission . = = = = Impact of Marseille 's death = = = = JG 27 was moved out of Africa for about a month because of the impact Marseille 's death had on morale . The deaths of two other German aces , G\u00fcnter Steinhausen and Marseille 's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt , just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low . One biographer suggests these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille , although it was not entirely within his control . The more success Marseille had , the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit . So his death , when it came , was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for . Historians Hans Ring and Christopher Shores also point to the fact that Marseille 's promotions were based on personal success rates more than any other reason , and other pilots did not get to score air victories , let alone become Experten themselves . They flew support as the \" maestro showed them how it was done \" , and often \" held back from attacking enemy aircraft to build his score still higher \" . As a result there was no other Experten to step into Marseille 's shoes if he was killed . Eduard Neumann explained : \" This handicap [ that very few pilots scored ] was partially overcome by the morale effect on the whole Geschwader of the success of pilots like Marseille . In fact most of the pilots in Marseille 's staffel acted in secondary role as escort to the \" master \" . \" Still Neumann , who was himself one of the Luftwaffe 's most able operational leaders , in the assessment of his subordinate commander 's quality was not necessarily easily imitable : \" As a fighter pilot Marseille was absolutely supreme ... Above all , he possessed lightning reflexes and could make a quicker judgment in a bigger orbit than anyone else ... Marseille was unique ... \" Marseille 's impact on enemy fighter pilots and their morale is unclear . Andrew Thomas quoted Pilot Officer Bert Houle of No. 213 Squadron RAF ; \" He was an extremely skilled pilot and a deadly shot . It was a helpless feeling to be continually bounced , and to do so little about it . \" Robert Tate on the other hand is sceptical that enemy pilots would have been familiar with each other , \" How well was Marseille known to DAF personnel in the Desert ? Apparently not so well . Although there is little indication that some Allied pilots may have heard of Marseille , this information did not readily make its way down to Allied Squadrons . Fanciful stories abound of how pilots knew of one another and hoped to duel with each other in the skies . This was more than likely not the case . \" = = Memorials = = Hans-Joachim Marseille appeared four times in the Deutsche Wochenschau . The first time on Wednesday 17 February 1942 when Oberst Galland , the General der Jagdflieger , visited an airport in the desert . The second time on Wednesday 1 July 1942 when Marseille travelled to Rastenburg to receive the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords from Adolf Hitler . The third time on Wednesday 9 September 1942 announcing Marseille 's 17 aerial victories from 1 September 1942 and that he had been awarded the Diamonds to his Knight 's Cross . His last appearance dates from Wednesday 30 September 1942 showing Hauptmann Marseille visiting Erwin Rommel . A wartime pyramid was constructed by Italian engineers at the site of Marseille 's fall but over time it decayed . On 22 October 1989 , Eduard Neumann and other JG 27 survivors in co-operation with the Egyptian government , erected a new pyramid that stands there to this day . In the weeks following Marseille 's death morale was low . In an attempt to improve morale Oberleutnant Fritz Dettmann persuaded Eduard Neumann to rename 3 . / JG 27 the \" Marseille Staffel \" ( seen in photographs as \" Staffel Marseille \" ) . His grave bears a one-word epitaph : Undefeated . It is understood that after the war , Hans-Joachim Marseille 's remains were brought from Derna and reinterred in the memorial gardens at Tobruk ; it was there that his mother visited his grave in 1954 . His remains are now in a small clay coffin ( sarcophagus ) bearing the number 4133 . In 1957 , a German film , Der Stern von Afrika ( The Star of Africa ) directed by Alfred Weidenmann , was made starring Joachim Hansen as Hans-Joachim Marseille . On 24 October 1975 , the Bundesluftwaffe 's Uetersen-Appen Barracks was renamed the \" Marseille Barracks \" . The Memorial of the Reuter-Marseille family can be found in the graveyard in Berlin , Alt-Sch\u00f6neberg . The left side bears the insignia . The tail rudder of his second to last Messerschmitt Bf 109F-4 / trop ( Werknummer 8673 ) now bearing 158 victory marks is on display at Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr in Berlin Gatow . It had initially been given to his family as a gift by Hermann G\u00f6ring and was donated to the museum in the 1970s . Twenty-five years after Marseille 's death , fighter pilot veterans of World War II gathered to honour Marseille at an \" International Fighter Pilots Meeting \" on 7 \u2013 8 October 1967 at F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck . Attending this meeting were fighter pilots from six different countries , including Erich Hartmann , Robert Stanford Tuck , Adolf Galland , G\u00fcnther Rall and Mike Martin , who was shot down by Marseille on 3 June 1942 . The guests of honour at this meeting were Marseille 's mother , Frau Charlotte Reuter-Marseille and his ex-fianc\u00e9e Hanne-Lies . The 16th Deutsches Afrikakorps reunion took place on 1 \u2013 2 September 1984 in Stuttgart . The German Bundesregierung invited as guest of honour Corporal Mathew P. Letuku from South Africa . Matthew , alias Mathias to everyone in JG 27 , was a black South African soldier taken prisoner of war by German troops on the morning of 21 June 1941 at fortress Tobruk . Mathias initially worked as a volunteer driver with 3 . Staffel then befriended Marseille and became his domestic helper in Africa . = = Victory claims and notable actions = = F\u00e4hnrich Hans-Joachim Marseille was transferred to his first combat assignment with the I. ( Jagd ) / Lehrgeschwader 2 at the time stationed at Calais-Marck on Sunday 10 August 1940 . Two days later he arrived at this unit on 12 August 1940 . He was assigned to the 1 . Staffel of this Gruppe . Staffelkapit\u00e4n was Oberleutnant Adolf Buhl . One of the Schwarmf\u00fchrer was Oberfeldwebel Helmut Goedert , to whom Marseille was assigned as wingman . Marseille already flew his very first combat mission on the next day , Wednesday 13 August 1940 and claimed his first aerial victory on 24 August 1940 . In over little more than two years he would amass another 157 aerial victories . His 158 aerial victories were claimed in 382 combat missions . This and the \u2660 ( Ace of spades ) indicates those days which made Marseille an ace-in-a-day , a term which designates a fighter pilot who has shot down five or more airplanes in a single day . This indicates that the aerial combat report is missing from the German Federal Archives . This indicates that Australian historian Russell Brown has expressed doubt regarding the veracity of Marseille 's claims . Marseille 's 151 claims in North Africa included : 101 Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk / Kittyhawk fighters ; 30 Hawker Hurricane fighters ; 16 Supermarine Spitfire fighters ; Two Martin A-30 Baltimore bombers ; One Bristol Blenheim bomber ; and One Martin Maryland bomber . The German Federal Archives still hold records for 109 of Marseille aerial victories . A further biographer of Marseille , Walter W\u00fcbbe , has made an attempt to link these records to Allied units , squadrons and when possible even to individual pilots , in order to verify the claims as much as possible . = = = Dispute over claims = = = Some serious discrepancies between Allied squadron records and German claims have caused some historians and Allied veterans to question the accuracy of Marseille 's official victories , in addition to those of JG 27 as a whole . Attention is often focused on the 26 claims made by JG 27 on 1 September 1942 , of which 17 were claimed by Marseille alone . Another biographer , Franz Kurowski , claims that 24 of the 26 victories were verified through Allied records after the war . A USAF historian , Major Robert Tate states : \" [ f ] or years , many British historians and militarists refused to admit that they had lost any aircraft that day in North Africa . Careful review of records however do show that the British [ and South Africans ] did lose more than 17 aircraft that day , and in the area that Marseille operated . \" Tate also reveals 20 RAF single-engined fighters and one twin engined fighter were destroyed and several others severely damaged , as well as a further USAAF P-40 shot down . However , overall Tate reveals that Marseille 's kill total comes close to 65 \u2013 70 percent corroboration , indicating as many as 50 of his claims may not have been actually kills . Tate also compares Marseilles rate of corroboration with the top six P-40 pilots . While only the Canadian James Francis Edwards ' records shows a verification of 100 percent other aces like Clive Caldwell ( 50 % to 60 % corroboration ) , Billy Drake ( 70 % to 80 % corroboration ) , John Lloyd Waddy ( 70 % to 80 % corroboration ) and Andrew Barr ( 60 % to 70 % corroboration ) are at the same order of magnitude as Marseille 's claims . Christopher Shores and Hans Ring also support Tate 's conclusions . British historian Stephen Bungay gives a figure of 20 Allied losses that day . However , the claims for 15 September 1942 are in serious doubt , following the first detailed scrutiny of the records of individual Allied squadrons by Australian historian Russell Brown . Moreover , Brown lists three occasions on which Marseille could not have downed as many aircraft as claimed . Stephan Bungay has pointed out the low military value of shooting down DAF fighters , rather than the bombers that , by mid-1942 , were having a highly damaging effect on Axis ground units and convoy routes . Referring to 1 September 1942 , Bungay points out that even if Marseille shot down 15 of the 17 he claimed that day , \" the rest of the 100 or so German fighter pilots between them only got five . The British [ sic ] lost no bombers at all ... During this period the DAF lost only a few bombers , but all fell to anti-aircraft defences and evidence shows that Rommel was forced onto the defensive because of the losses inflicted by bombers . = = Summary of career = = = = = Decorations = = = Sometime in the early 1990s , one of Marseille 's biographers , Robert Tate , visited the former Marseille-Kaserne base and Museum to see and photograph Marseille 's medals .

( Jagd ) / LG 2 II . / JG 52 I. / JG 27 = = = Absence from the Geschwader = = = = = Marseille and his environment = = Several biographers of Hans-Joachim Marseille have written about his distain for authority and for the National Socialist movement in general . This first came to the fore in the movie , The Star of Africa , the fictionalised 1957 movie about his life , which described an incident that occurred shortly after Marseille was presented the Swords to the Knight 's Cross . The young Oberleutnant , while on visit in Germany , was presented with evidence of the Final Solution ( Holocaust ) . Shocked by this information , he did not return to North Africa but went into hiding in Italy instead . Only after the Gestapo established his whereabouts and pressured him did he return to his Geschwader . Further research by other biographers has unearthed some truth to this story and his attitude to the ruling Nazi movement . Marseille demonstrated his lack of respect for the Nazi elite during his visit to Germany in June \u2013 August 1942 . Marseille was a gifted pianist and was invited to play a piece at the home of Willy Messerschmitt , an industrialist and designer of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter Marseille had achieved so much success in . Guests at the party included Adolf Hitler , party chairman Martin Borman , Hitler 's deputy and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe , Hermann G\u00f6ring , head of the SS , Heinrich Himmler and Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels . After impressing with a display of piano play for over an hour , including Ludwig van Beethoven 's F\u00fcr Elise , Marseille proceeded to play American Jazz , which was considered degenerate in Nazi ideology . Hitler stood , raised his hand , and said \" I think we 've heard enough \" and left the room . Magda Goebbels found the prank amusing and Artur Axmann recalled how his \" blood froze \" when he heard this \" Ragtime \" music being played in front of the F\u00fchrer . Later that month Marseille was invited to another function , despite his stunt . Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Karl Wolff , Pers\u00f6nlicher Stab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS to the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler , confirmed that during his visit Marseille overheard a conversation which mentioned the mistreatment of Jews . He stated : Globocnik and I were talking about Operation Reinhard , which was in full effect following Heydrich 's murder , and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka . I know I asked him about H\u00f6ss , who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp ( Auschwitz ) . Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared , and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with . I noticed that this young pilot , who I later learned was Marseille , must have overheard , and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him . I decided against it . When Marseille returned to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket , Clade and Schr\u00f6er , whether they had heard what was happening to Jews and if perhaps something was underway that they did not know about . Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more . Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood , including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth . Regardless of his hero status , when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him , his enquiries were either met with awkward silences , or people changed the subject or even turned away . Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille 's attitude toward his nation 's cause . He never spoke of this with his comrades again .",

Having joined the Army as a boy , Large fought in the Korean War and was wounded and taken prisoner at the Battle of Imjin . He spent two years in a prisoner-of-war camp , where his injuries went untreated and he lost more than a third of his body weight . After his release and rehabilitation , he joined the Special Air Service ( SAS ) and went on to serve in various conflicts around the world , hunting communist guerrillas in Malaya , suppressing rebellions in Oman and Aden , and conducting deniable cross-border reconnaissance and raids during the Indonesia \u2013 Malaysia confrontation . An imposing figure \u2013 he was almost 6 feet 6 inches ( 1.98 m ) tall \u2013 he was given the nickname \" Lofty \" after joining the Army . After his retirement , Large wrote two books about his Army career , preceding such authors as Andy McNab and Chris Ryan . Andy McNab has said that Large and his books were \" instrumental in setting the template for future members of the [ SAS ] Regiment \" . = = Early life = = Large was born in Oxfordshire , the first child of Joseph Large and his wife Emily ( n\u00e9e Pratley ) . His sister , Janet , was nine years his junior . In 1939 , the family moved to a cottage 2 miles ( 3 km ) outside the village of Guiting Power in the Gloucestershire Cotswolds . As a child his father taught him how to shoot game ; he later said of this experience , \" little did I realise I would spend a lot of time , many years later [ in the SAS ] , being trained in exactly that type of instinctive shooting \" . Large would later dedicate his first book to \" the best parents a man could ask for \" . Growing up during the Second World War , and having watched British and American soldiers on field exercises in the Cotswold Hills , Large said that he had always wanted to be a soldier . He also joined the Army Cadet Force . = = Army career = = Large joined the British Army as a \" band boy \" at the age of 15 . Unable to join his county regiment ( the Gloucestershire Regiment ) because of a lack of vacancies , he instead joined the Wiltshire Regiment , with whom he served for five years in England , Germany and Hong Kong . During this time he was given the nickname \" Lofty \" , having reached his adult height of 6 feet 5 3 \u2044 4 inches ( 1.975m ) . In 1951 , by requesting a transfer to the Gloucestershire Regiment , Large volunteered to fight in the Korean War . After a combat training course in Japan , he was deployed to the front line . = = = Korean War = = = In March 1951 , along with half a dozen other newly badged Glosters , Large was sent to B Company 's position in the low hills above the Imjin River . The Glosters , as part of the 29th Brigade , were defending routes through the valley that could potentially be used by the Chinese in a southbound offensive towards Seoul . On 22 April 1951 , they engaged with Chinese troops in the Battle of Imjin . By the morning of 24 April , B Company had fought off seven assaults before they were able to rejoin the remainder of their battalion on what became known as Gloster Hill . By this time the battalion was vastly outnumbered , low on ammunition and cut off from United Nations lines . Large himself was shot in the left shoulder and , along with most of the remaining Glosters , was forced to surrender . After a 10-day forced march north , and having received only basic medical attention , Large arrived at a prison camp outside Chongsung , about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju . He spent two years in the camp and celebrated his 21st birthday there . Throughout his incarceration he had two bullets and at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body . To help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries , an American POW introduced him to marijuana , which grew wild in the area . Although he found it to be a highly effective \u2013 and enjoyable \u2013 painkiller , he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug . Like many of his fellow prisoners , Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery . In March 1953 , a Chinese doctor operated on Large and removed a tracer round from his ribs as a preliminary to his being released as part of an exchange of wounded prisoners . Having weighed 217 pounds ( 98 kg ) in March 1951 , he had dropped to 136 pounds ( 62 kg ) by the time of his release . He also still had very limited movement in his atrophied and wasted left arm and was later told that if he had been treated by a British doctor at the time of his injury his arm would probably have been amputated . Large was one of a batch of 22 exchanged British POWs whose release and subsequent return to Britain became front-page news : The Guardian newspaper reported that the group had been unaware of the death of King George VI ( which had occurred over a year earlier ) , but were now looking forward to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . Interviewed after his release , Large described the war as \" useless \" and said that he believed the communist 's claims that the US had engaged in germ warfare . For its defence of Gloster Hill in the Battle of Imjin , the 1st Battalion , Gloucestershire Regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation . The citation is conferred on units of the armed forces of the United States and of allied nations , and was awarded to the Glosters for \" exceptionally outstanding performance of duty and extraordinary heroism in action against the armed enemy ... Every yard of ground they surrendered was covered with enemy dead , until the last gallant soldier of the fighting battalion was over-powered by the final surge of the enemy masses . \" After returning to the UK , Large was offered a discharge on medical grounds , which he declined . He went on to serve briefly in the quartermaster 's stores , as an instructor , and in the regimental police . Throughout this time he worked on regaining his fitness and rehabilitating his arm . = = = Special Air Service = = = In 1957 , wanting to escape the \" stupidities of drill \" and the \" bullshit \" of the regular Army , Large volunteered for the SAS ; however , while riding home from the Brecon Beacons within hours of successfully completing the notoriously tough selection course , he crashed his motorbike , and , having injured his ankle , he had to repeat selection \u2013 this time with one boot two sizes larger than the other to accommodate the bandages and swelling . He went on to serve with 22 SAS in Malaya , Oman , Borneo and Aden . Large 's first operation with the SAS was in Malaya , hunting the Malayan Races Liberation Army ( MRLA ) guerrillas engaged in the Malayan Emergency uprising . By the time of Large 's involvement there was little communist activity and , despite months of jungle patrols and encounters with leeches , scorpions , civet cats and tigers , he never had any contact with MRLA guerrillas . While suppressing a rebellion in Oman in 1958 , Large infamously lost his temper with a recalcitrant donkey . Recalling the incident in a 2003 interview , he said : All the donkey handler did was laugh . Just as I turned round , the donkey 's face was right by me and it shook its head and I stuck a punch in among it somewhere , and the donkey went down like it was shot ... much to my amazement . But not to as much amazement as the donkey handler 's \u2013 I 've never seen a bloke sober up so quick . It was a hole in one : the donkey struggled to its feet and looked really willing to go up the hill and the donkey handler lost his laugh . Several weeks later , in January 1959 , Large was part of the \" A \" and \" D \" Squadron assault on the Jebel Akhdar . This entailed a 2,500-metre ( 8,200 ft ) overnight ascent of the south side of the jebel , with each soldier carrying up to 120 pounds ( 54 kg ) of kit . Having completed the ascent the SAS were able to surprise and defeat the rebels , who had previously held the plateau as a virtually impregnable stronghold . During the Indonesia \u2013 Malaysia confrontation in Borneo , Large took part in Operation Claret . As the leader of a four-man SAS patrol , he spent up to two weeks at a time hidden in the jungle on deniable incursions into Indonesia , performing reconnaissance or ambushing Indonesian forces . While hidden on the banks of the Sungei Koemba River during one of these incursions , Large and his patrol had the opportunity to assassinate Colonel Leonardus Moerdani , the commander of the Indonesian special forces in the area ( and later Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces and subsequently Indonesia 's Minister of Defence and Security ) , who was passing by on a river boat . However , at the last moment Large spotted a woman on the boat . He later described the incident : There could have been other women and there could have been children on the boat . And we don 't do that sort of target , so ... it went . And it was in fact the very man we 'd been looking for for three months : Colonel Moerdani of the Indonesian paracommando unit , and he was on the end of my rifle and I let him go \u2013 but ... you can 't blat women and kids . For his service in Borneo , he was mentioned in despatches . Parachuting was an important part of SAS training and operations , but it was not an experience that Large enjoyed : He suffered from a fear of heights and his considerable bulk meant that he descended far too quickly to have any chance of a comfortable landing . Despite this , he eventually qualified as a parachute instructor , although the footnote on his course report read , \" not suited to parachuting \u2013 either in size or inclination . \" In his memoirs Large recalls that the last shots he fired on active duty were warning shots . Fired at long range at the ground a few feet in front of a local woman ( it is unclear where the incident took place ) , they were intended to dissuade her from heading into \" certain danger \" . Despite firing increasingly close to the woman 's feet , she continued forward , moving out of sight , only to reappear moments later leading the previously unseen bull which she had been intent on retrieving \u2013 \" What a player ! God help any poor son-in-law she might have . \" Large spent the final years of his 27-year Army career as an instructor with 23 SAS Regiment ( one of the SAS 's two reserve regiments ) , eventually leaving the Army in 1973 as a Squadron Sergeant Major and Warrant Officer Class 2 . = = Legacy = = In his book SAS Heroes : Remarkable Soldiers , Extraordinary Men , former SAS soldier Pete Scholey describes Large as \" simply the finest soldier [ I ] had ever met ... an inspiration to those around him ... with an admirable sense of fair play \" . Andy McNab , who joined the SAS 11 years after Large 's departure , has written about Large 's enduring impact on the Regiment : Being like Lofty was something I aspired to without realising it . When I joined the Regiment I was told that the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be . Shut up , watch and listen . For me there were a number of the ' old and bold ' who fitted that requirement . It wasn 't until later in my service that I learned that most of them , as newly ' badged ' members to a squadron , had picked Lofty . A memorial bench was donated to the Allied Special Forces Memorial Grove at the National Memorial Arboretum by a group of Large 's former SAS colleagues . The inscription reads : = = Personal life = = Before leaving for Hong Kong with the Wiltshire Regiment in 1951 , Large had met Ann , a nanny at the Regiment 's depot in Devizes . She wrote to him five times a week during his captivity in Chongsung , although only about 90 of these letters were actually delivered to Large . They eventually married in 1955 and afterwards lived in an Army rental property on the top floor of a farmhouse in Longford , on the outskirts of Gloucester . When Large volunteered for the SAS in 1957 it was not a unit that was well known outside of military circles \u2013 a fact that Large took advantage of by initially telling his wife that the Regiment 's job was to air drop supplies to troops in the jungle . In 1960 the couple moved with the Regiment to Hereford , where they later had two children , Andy and Donna . = = Later years = = After leaving the Army Large worked in the UK and the Middle East . Having earned a heavy goods vehicle driving licence and a qualified testing officer 's certificate during his time in the Army , he spent the last 14 years of his working life as a driving instructor . He wrote two books about his time in the Army : One Man 's SAS and One Man 's War in Korea , and was one of the first non-commissioned officers ( NCOs ) to write about the SAS , preceding such soldiers-turned-authors as Andy McNab and Chris Ryan . A third book , Soldier Against the Odds : From Korean War to SAS , consisted of revised versions of his first two books together with some additional material . Andy McNab has said that \" [ Large 's first two books ] were recommended reading for Regiment candidates . He was instrumental in setting the template for future members of the Regiment . \" In his seventies , Large , along with Pete Scholey , returned to the Borneo jungle as part of a 2003 Channel 4 documentary about the history of the SAS , taking the camera crew to the exact spot on the bank of the Sungei Koemba River where his patrol had successfully ambushed an Indonesian Army river boat in 1965 . Having been ill with leukaemia for three years , Large died aged 76 at St Michael 's Hospice , Hereford . His funeral was held on 1 November 2006 at St Martin 's Church ( which has a long association with the SAS ) .",

                    "text": "Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) = The Siege of Port Royal in 1707 was two separate attempts by English colonists from New England to conquer Acadia ( roughly the present-day Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick ) by capturing its capital Port Royal ( now Annapolis Royal ) during Queen Anne 's War . Both attempts were made by colonial militia , and were led by men inexperienced in siege warfare . Led by Acadian Governor Daniel d 'Auger de Subercase , the French troops at Port Royal easily withstood both attempts , assisted by irregular Acadians and the Wabanaki Confederacy outside the fort . The first siege began on June 6 , 1707 , and lasted 11 days . The English colonel , John March , was able to establish positions near Port Royal 's fort , but his engineer claimed the necessary cannons could not be landed , and the force withdrew amid disagreements in the war council . The second siege began August 22 , and was never able to establish secure camps , owing to spirited defensive sorties organized by Acadian Governor Daniel d 'Auger de Subercase . The siege attempts were viewed as a debacle in Boston , and the expedition 's leaders were jeered upon their return . Port Royal was captured in 1710 by a larger force that included British Army troops ; that capture marked the end of French rule in peninsular Acadia . = = Background = = Port Royal was the capital of the French colony of Acadia almost since the French first began settling the area in 1604 . It consequently became a focal point for conflict between English and French colonists in the next century . It was destroyed in 1613 by English raiders led by Samuel Argall , but eventually rebuilt . In 1690 it was captured by forces from the Province of Massachusetts Bay , although it was restored to France by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick . = = = French preparations = = = With the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702 , colonists on both sides again prepared for conflict . Acadia 's governor , Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois de Monbeton de Brouillan , had , in anticipation of war , already begun construction of a stone and earth fort in 1701 , which was largely completed by 1704 . Following a French raid on Deerfield on the Massachusetts frontier in February 1704 , the English in Boston organized a raid against Acadia the following May . Led by Benjamin Church , they raided Grand Pr\u00e9 and other Acadian communities . English and French accounts differ on whether Church 's expedition mounted an attack on Port Royal . Church 's account indicates that they anchored in the harbour and considered making an attack , but ultimately decided against the idea ; French accounts claim that a minor attack was made . When Daniel d 'Auger de Subercase became governor of Acadia in 1706 , he went on the offensive , encouraging Indian raids against English targets in New England . He also encouraged privateering from Port Royal against English colonial shipping . The privateers were highly effective ; the English fishing fleet on the Grand Banks was reduced by 80 percent between 1702 and 1707 , and some English coastal communities were raided . = = = New England preparations = = = English merchants in Boston had long traded with Port Royal , and some of this activity had continued even after the war began . Some of these merchants , notably Samuel Vetch , were closely associated with Massachusetts Bay 's Governor Joseph Dudley , and by 1706 outrage began growing in the colonial assembly over the matter . Vetch chose to deal with these allegations by going to London to press a case for a military expedition against New France , while Dudley , who had previously requested such support without response , chose to demonstrate his anti-French sentiment by organizing an expedition against Port Royal using mostly colonial resources . In March 1707 he revived an idea he had first developed in 1702 that called for provincial militia to man an expedition supported by resources of the Royal Navy that were locally available . His proposal was approved by the assembly on 21 March . Colonial popular opinion was divided on the need for the expedition : some ministers argued in its favour from the pulpit , while Cotton Mather \" Pray 'd God not to carry his people hence . \" Massachusetts raised two full regiments , totalling nearly 1,000 men ; New Hampshire provided 60 men , Rhode Island provided 80 , and a company of Indians from Cape Cod was also recruited . Recruiting was difficult in Massachusetts due to the lack of enthusiasm for the endeavour , and authorities were forced to draft men to fill the ranks . Connecticut was also asked to contribute to the expedition , but declined , citing bad feelings over the return of Port Royal by treaty after its capture in 1690 . The force , which was placed under the command of Massachusetts Colonel John March , totalled 1,150 soldiers and 450 sailors , and was carried by a fleet of 24 ships , including the 50 gun man of war Deptford under the command of Captain Charles Stuckley , and the 24 gun colonial Province Galley of Cyprian Southack . ( March took a former prisoner of the Maliseet , John Gyles as his translator . ) = = First siege = = The English fleet arrived outside the channel of the Port Royal harbour on June 6 , and troops were landed the next day . Governor Subercase 's defence force at the time consisted of 100 troupes de la marine that had fortuitously been reinforced by the recent arrival of another 60 who were due to take command of a recently built frigate . Just hours before the English arrival he had also welcomed about 100 Abenaki Indians led by the young Bernard-Anselme d 'Abbadie de Saint-Castin . As soon as the English ships were spotted , Subercase also called out the local militia , mustering about 60 men . Colonel March landed with about 700 men to the north of the fort , and another 300 to its south under the command of Colonel Samuel Appleton , with the goal of establishing a siege line around the fort . Both forces were landed too far from the fort and spent the rest of the day marching toward it . Subercase sent a small force to the south on the morning of the 8th , who were driven back toward the fort by Appleton . Subercase himself led a larger contingent to the north , where he established an ambush at a river March 's force would have to cross . After a sharp battle in which Subercase 's horse was shot out from under him , the defenders were pushed back into the fort . The New Englanders established camps about 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) from the fort . Subercase sent parties out of the fort to harass English foraging parties , giving rise to rumors that additional militia forces were en route from northern Acadia . The English managed to advance their lines closer to the fort , but their engineer , Colonel John Redknap , did not believe the expedition 's heavy cannons could be landed safely , because they \" must pass within command of the fort \" . This led to disagreements between March , Redknap , and Stuckley which spelled the end of the expedition . After a final assault on June 16 , which French accounts describe as a failed attempt to take the fort , and English accounts say was merely an attempt to destroy some buildings outside the fort , the expedition embarked on its ships and sailed off on the 17th . March directed the fleet to sail for Casco Bay ( near present-day Portland , Maine ) . = = Interlude = = From Casco Bay Colonel March sent a letter to Boston , in which he laid the blame for the expedition 's failure on Stuckley and Redknap . News of the failure preceded his messengers , and they were met upon their arrival by a jeering crowd of women and children . Colonel Redknap , one of the messengers , was able to convince Governor Dudley that he had acted within his orders , and blame was generally attached to March for the failure . Dudley issued orders to March that the fleet should stay put , with all men remaining aboard under penalty of death , while his council considered the next step . Dudley eventually sent reinforcements and a three-man commission ( including two militia colonels and John Leverett , a lawyer with no military experience ) to oversee affairs , and ordered the expedition to make a second attack . Despite the orders , desertion from the fleet was high , and the forces was reduced to about 850 when it sailed for Port Royal in late August . Colonel March resigned the expedition command and was replaced by Colonel Francis Wainwright . Governor Subercase was forewarned of the second attempt , and had erected additional defenses to impede the attackers ' approaches . He was also reinforced by the fortuitous arrival of the Intrepide , a French frigate under the command of Pierre Morpain . His crew was added to the defences , and captured prize ships he brought with him provided needed provisions for the fort . = = Second siege = = The English fleet arrived near Port Royal on August 21 , and Wainwright landed his troops about 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) below ( south of ) the fort the next day and marched them to a position about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) north of the fort . This area , where March had previously camped , was one of the areas near which Subercase had thrown up additional defensive earthworks . On August 23 Wainwright sent a detachment of 300 to clear a path for the heavy cannon ; this attempt was repulsed by forces sent out by Subercase to harass them . Using guerrilla-style tactics and fire from the fort 's cannons , they forced the English to retreat to their camp . This defeat apparently had a significant effect on English morale ; Wainwright wrote that his camp was \" surrounded with enemies and judging it unsafe to proceed on any service without a company of at least one hundred men . \" In what was probably the most serious clash , an English party cutting brush was ambushed by a French and Indian force , and nine of the party were killed . The situation got so bad in the English camp that on the 27th they withdrew to a camp protected by their ships ' guns . The camp was not properly fortified , and the Englishmen were constantly subjected to sniping and attacks from swarming French and Indians . When Wainwright made a second landing at another point on August 31 , Subercase himself led 120 soldiers out of the fort . About 70 men engaged the New Englanders in hand-to-hand combat , which was fought with axes and musket butts . Saint-Castin and almost 20 of his men were wounded while five others were killed . The next day , September 1 , the English reembarked on their ships , and sailed back to Boston . The French in their reports claimed to have killed as many as 200 men , but English sources claim only about 16 killed and 16 wounded in the siege . = = Aftermath = = The expedition 's return to Boston was also met with jeers . Dudley 's commissioners were sarcastically called \" the three Port Royal worthies \" and \" the three champions \" . Dudley 's reports of the affair minimized its failings , pointing out that many plantations around Port Royal had been destroyed during the two sieges . Dudley also refused to make inquiries into the expedition 's failure , fearing the blame would be placed on him . Subercase , concerned that the British might return the following year , worked to strengthen the fortifications at Port Royal . He also built a small warship to assist in the colony 's defenses , and convinced Morpain to raid New England shipping . The privateer was so successful that by the end of 1708 Port Royal was overcrowded with prisoners from the captured prizes . None of this ultimately helped save Port Royal from the next attack , since France failed to send any significant support , while the British mobilized larger and better-organized forces . Samuel Vetch , with support from Dudley , Boston merchants , and the New England fishing community , successfully lobbied Queen Anne for military support for an expedition to conquer all of New France in 1709 . This prompted the colonists to mobilize in the expectation that troops would arrive from England ; their efforts were aborted when the promised military support failed to materialize . Vetch and Francis Nicholson returned to England in its aftermath , and again secured promises of military support for an attempt on Port Royal in 1710 . In the summer of 1710 a fleet arrived in Boston carrying 400 marines . Augmented by colonial regiments , this force successfully captured Port Royal after a third siege in 1710 .",

Starting from humble origins , he joined the Greek struggle for independence , achieving the rank of general and leading his men to notable victories . Following Greek independence , he had a tumultuous public career , playing a prominent part in the granting of the first Constitution of the Kingdom of Greece and later being sentenced to death and pardoned . Despite his important contributions to the political life of the early Greek state , general Makriyannis is mostly remembered for his Memoirs . Aside from being a source of historical and cultural information about the period , this work has also been called a \" monument of Modern Greek literature \" , as it is written in pure Demotic Greek . Indeed , its literary quality led Nobel laureate Giorgos Seferis to call Makriyannis one of the greatest masters of Modern Greek prose . = = Biography = = = = = Early life = = = Yannis Makriyannis was born to a poor family in the village of Avoriti , in the vicinity of Doris . \" Makriyannis \" was a nickname he acquired because of his height . His father , Dimitris Triantaphyllou , was killed in a clash with the forces of Ali Pasha . His family was forced to flee to Levadeia , where Makriyannis spent his childhood up to 1811 . At age seven , he was given as a foster son to a wealthy man from Levadeia , but the menial labour and beatings he endured were , in his own words , \" his death \" . Thus , in 1811 he left for Arta to stay with an acquaintance who maintained close relations with Ali Pasha . There , still a teenager , he was involved in trade and , according to his memoirs , became a wealthy man . His property amounted to 40,000 piastres . According to Sphyroeras , he probably joined the Filiki Etaireia , a secret anti-Ottoman society , in 1820 . In March 1821 he left for Patras , in the Peloponnese , supposedly on business . His actual assignment , however , was to inform local members of the Filiki Etaireia of the state of affairs in his native Roumeli . Having met with Odysseas Androutsos , he returned to Arta two days before the revolution broke out in Patras and was promptly arrested by the Ottoman authorities and placed under arrest in the local fortress . He was held captive for 90 days but managed to escape and , in August 1821 , first took up arms against the Ottomans under chieftain Gogos Bakolas . = = = Activity during the War of Independence = = = Under the command of Gogos Bakolas , in September 1821 he took part in the battle of Stavros , near Tzoumerka , and in the battle of Peta , where he sustained a light leg injury . A few days later he took part in the siege of Arta that temporarily brought the city under Greek control . In late 1821 , he left for Mesolonghi , but there , according to his memoirs , he fell seriously ill , only recovering in March 1822 . Having spent his recovery in the village of Sernikaki , near Salona , he resumed military action , assuming the leadership of a band of warriors from four villages in the vicinity . He fought alongside several other chieftains during the successful siege of Patratziki , which had been fortified with considerable Ottoman forces . After the Acropolis of Athens was surrendered by the Ottomans in June 1822 , Makriyannis was appointed Supervisor of Public Order in the city by the executive authority of Roumeli on 1 January 1823 . In that office , he took severe measures aimed at stopping arbitrary oppression of the populace and thievery . In the summer of 1823 , he fought alongside Nikitaras in the eastern part of Central Greece . In October 1823 , he led a force of Roumeliots in the Peloponnese , and fought alongside the government of Georgios Kountouriotis against the rebels in the civil war . For his actions during that conflict , he was rewarded with the rank of brigadier , promoted to lieutenant general in August 1824 and full general in late 1824 . In March 1825 , after the Peloponnese had been invaded by Egyptian forces , he was appointed politarch ( head of public order ) of Kyparissia and took part in the defence of Neokastro . After the fortress fell on 11 May 1825 , he hurried to Myloi , near Nafplio , arriving with one hundred men on 10 June . He ordered the construction of makeshift fortifications , as well as the gathering of provisions . More chieftains soon arrived in Myloi and Ibrahim Pasha , the commander of the Egyptian forces , was unable to take the position , despite numerical superiority and the launching of fierce attacks on 12 and 14 June . Makriyannis was injured during the battle and was carried to Nafplio . Soon after the battle , he married the daughter of a prominent Athenian , and his activities were thereafter inextricably linked with that city until his death . After Athens was captured by Ibrahim Pasha in June 1826 , Makriyannis helped organise the defence of the Acropolis , and became the provisional commander of the garrison after the death of the commander , Yannis Gouras . He managed to repel a fierce assault against the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on 7 October , and during the defence of the Acropolis , he sustained heavy injures three times , to the head and to the neck . These wounds troubled him for the remainder of his life , but they did not dissuade him from taking part in the last phase of the war : in the spring of 1827 he took part in the battles of Piraeus and the battle of Analatos . = = = Activity after Greek Independence = = = = = = = Governorship of Kapodistrias = = = = Makriyannis 's activity did not cease with the achievement of Greek independence . After Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias arrived in Greece , he appointed Makriyannis \" General Leader of the Executive Authority of the Peloponnese \" , based in Argos , in 1828 . It was during this period , and more specifically on 26 February 1829 , that he started writing his Memoirs . After Kapodistrias restructured the military in 1830 , Makriyannis was given the rank of brigadier . However , he slowly came to oppose the Governor 's policies and eventually broke with him . He opposed what he considered Kapodistrias 's personal authoritarianism and , on a more personal level , was concerned about whether his home region would be included or not in the liberated Greek state . Influenced by Ioannis Kolettis , he even tried to force the Governor into accepting a constitutional form of government , using the troops under his command , but had no success . Finally , in August 1831 , the government forced all civil servants and military personnel to sign an oath stating they were not part of secret organizations and that they were loyal servants of the government 's commands . Makriyannis considered this to be degrading , and tried to author his own version of an oath instead . This , however , was not accepted by the government , and he was consequently stripped of his positions . His opposition to the existing regime did not cease with the Governor 's assassination on 9 October 1831 . He took the side of the \" Constitutionalists \" and fought against the governor 's brother and successor Augustinos Kapodistrias . He did , however , condemn the assassination itself in the strongest terms . = = = = Reign of King Otto = = = = Otto , Prince of Bavaria , was chosen as the first King of Greece in 1832 , under the name Othon . His arrival in Nafplio , then the Greek capital , was hailed enthusiastically by Makriyannis . This attitude is exemplified in his Memoirs : Today the fatherland is reborn , that for so long was lost and extinguished . Today are raised from the dead the fighters , political , religious , as well as military , for our King has come , that we begot with the power of God . Praised be your most virtuous name , omnipotent and most merciful Lord . The hopes he had for the new regime , however , were soon to be dispelled . King Otho was underage and Bavarian regents were named to rule on his behalf during the first months of his rule . During the regency , Makriyannis came into conflict with the War Minister , the Bavarian Heideck , due to the latter 's attitude towards the veterans of the War of Independence . In the newly restructured Greek Army , there was little place left for the irregular bands of klephts . These guerilla-styled fighters had formed the backbone of the Greek forces during the war , and Makriyannis considered their exclusion from the newly formed army disrespectful . Furthermore , most of these men had been left with no resources after their exclusion from the military , and found themselves in a dire financial situation . Makriyannis also believed that the Prime Minister , the Bavarian von Armansperg , was personally responsible for the serious problems faced by the newly formed state . As a consequence , Makriyannis briefly retired from active politics . After municipalities were first instituted by Royal decree on 27 December 1833 , Makriyannis was elected to the city council of Athens ( the city becoming the new capital in 1834 ) . In that capacity he harshly criticised , to the extent that it was possible , what he perceived as omissions and authoritarianism by the royal administration and Palace Cabinet . He often voiced his demand for constitutional rule , even though the royal administration had initially held him in high esteem and given him the rank of colonel . During the King 's absence from Greece on the occasion of his marriage to Queen Amalia ( late 1836 \u2013 early 1837 ) , public discontent with von Armansperg was at its peak . The newspapers Athena and Elpis criticized him severely , and some politicians called for his removal . Makriyannis , in his capacity as President of the Athens city council , proposed , in January 1837 , the adoption of a resolution to be handed to the King upon his return requesting the granting of a Constitution . Not long before that , at a banquet attended by former fighters of the War of Independence , such as Kountouriotis , Kolokotronis and others , Makriyannis had toasted the health of the royal couple , adding \" may God enlighten them to rule us through constitutional laws , in accordance with the fatherland 's sacrifices \" . Von Armansperg immediately dissolved the city council , fired Mayor Petrakis and had Makriyannis placed under house arrest . Sometime during this period , Makriyannis commissioned 25 engravings from the painter and veteran of the War of Independence , Panaghiotis Zographos . The profits from the sales were used to the benefit of veterans of the war . Meanwhile , the demand for constitutional liberties was becoming widespread , as was discontent with King Otto 's Bavarian administration . The situation escalated in the 3 September 1843 Revolution that led to the granting of the first Constitution . Makriyannis was one of the three leaders of the movement . He played a crucial part in paving the way for this , having started as early as 1840 . After its granting , he also played an important part in the forming of the new cabinet . He was elected as a representative of Athens to the National ( Constitutional ) Assembly , and headed an informal group of 63 representatives loyal to him . He personally proposed various recommendations during the course of the proceedings . Soon after the conclusion of the Assembly 's work , however , he retired from politics . For his leading role in the creation of the first Greek Constitution , Makriyannis was depicted on the reverse of the Greek 50 drachmas commemorative coin issued in 1994 for the 150th anniversary of this historic document . There are three versions of the coin , each featuring one of the three leaders of the 3 September movement : one features Makriyannis , one colonel Dimitrios Kallergis , and one minister ( and later prime minister ) Andreas Metaxas . Makriyannis stopped working on his memoirs in 1850 , so information about the rest of his life , including his trial , comes from other sources . He was always outspoken about his views , and as a result he stirred negative reactions among his opponents . He opposed what he perceived as a continued degradation of the veterans of the War of Independence , and had repeatedly been considered suspect of plotting against King Otho . Furthermore , the King never quite forgave him for his part in the 3 September movement . When summoned to the palace and asked to denounce all the conspirators of 1843 , Makriyannis refused , saying \" I am not a slave \" . Eventually , in 1852 , he was accused of planning to \" overthrow the establishments and assassinate the King \" . On 13 April 1852 he was placed under house arrest , heavily guarded and with an officer posted in the room next to his own . On 16 March 1853 he was sentenced to death , in what has been called a \" pre-fabricated trial \" . According to Vidal-Naquet , the prosecution brought up false testimonies and false evidence . Furthermore , the president of the tribunal , Kitsos Tzavelas , was a personal enemy of Makriyannis . Five out of the six judges voted for the death sentence , and requested the King to extend royal clemency . His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the King , but he only spent 18 months in prison . King Otho reduced the sentence first to twenty , and later to ten years . He was finally pardoned and released on 2 September 1854 , thanks to the Crimean War . The blockade of Peiraeus by the French and British fleets also led to the imposition of Kallergis as Minister of War , despite his previous attempts at overthrowing the King . Thus , Kallergis used his newly acquired influence to have Makriyannis released . Makriyannis suffered greatly in prison , and after his release suffered from hallucinations . His condition did not improve with the death of one of his younger sons in the cholera epidemic that struck Athens . On 10 October 1862 a revolution broke out , which led to the eviction of King Otho I from the country . Makriyannis 's son , the future general Othon Makriyannis , reportedly presented his father with the King 's golden crown . Makriyannis was restored to the ranks he had been stripped of as a result of his trial , and was re-elected as a representative of Athens to the new National ( Constitutional ) Assembly of 1864 . He was promoted to the rank of general on 20 April 1864 , and died on 27 April . = = Literary work = = = = = Assessment and significance = = = Makriyannis concluded work on his Memoirs in the years before his imprisonment ; the last entries seem to be from September or October 1850 , as evinced by his references to the events of that period . In the text of the Memoirs , one can see not only the personal adventures and disappointments of his long public career , but , more significantly , his views on people , situations and events , phrased clearly and quite often passionately . They were first published in 1907 by Yannis Vlahogiannis , while some fragments of them had earlier been published in the newspaper Acropolis in 1904 . Spyridon Lambros , in 1908 , noted his straightforwardness and slight egotism , along with his holding firm to his own opinion ( as quoted by Sphyroeras ) . Kostis Palamas , in 1911 , called his work \" incomparable in its kind , a masterpiece of his illiterate , but strong and autonomous mind \" ( ibid ) . It should be noted that Makriyannis had received only the most basic and fragmentary education , and , according to his own testimony , mastered writing shortly before he started writing his Memoirs , while he was stationed in Argos . Makriyannis , having been ignored by history , and hardly mentioned by chroniclers of the War of Independence , had renewed interest in the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research . Despite this , after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs , they were hardly cited for almost 40 years . One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten , not only as a fighter , but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek ; a text that , besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence , is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time . Makriyannis 's reputation was revived during the German occupation of Greece . In 1941 , Yorgos Theotokas published an article on the general , calling his Memoirs \" a monument of Modern Greek literature \" because they were written in pure Demotic Greek . Two years later , in 1943 , the Greek Nobel laureate Giorgos Seferis gave a lecture on him , saying : In our times , ... when people seek to find in other people something clear and stable and compassionate , it is appropriate to speak of people such as Makriyannis . According to the National Book Centre of Greece , Seferis also stated that Makriyannis , along with Alexandros Papadiamantis , is one of the two greatest masters of modern Greek prose . Since then hundreds of essays have been written on the subject of his Memoirs , and it would be fair to say that the chronicler has overshadowed the fighter , and with good reason , according to Sphyroeras . Spyros Asdrachas has noted that : The fact that an illiterate man managed to use the Demotic speech ... to achieve an expressive density and dynamism entirely unusual of Greek prose made a terrific impression on people . The general 's objectivity , however , has often been questioned . Vlahogiannis , in his preface to the Memoirs , praises his honesty and contrasts it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality . While always straightforward , Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with . He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis , while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of . According to Sphyroeras , however , his judgements do not stem from selfishness , but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece . A few months after completing his Memoirs , on New Year 's Eve in 1851 , Makriyannis started to write another \" history \" , as he called it , which he interrupted rather abruptly in late March 1852 , when he was under house arrest . This text was acquired in 1936 or 1937 by Vlahogiannis , and was finally published in 1983 by Angelos Papakostas , aptly titled Visions and Wonders . It has , according to Papakostas , far less historical significance than the Memoirs . The events described therein are given briefly , and are used only as an excuse for his meditations and the interpretation of his Visions , on which he particularly insists . Vlahogiannis , according to Sphyroeras , considered the manuscript to be an overzealous work of a deranged mind , and that is the reason he did not publish it . The work , however , is also the product of a physically and mentally tormented soul , who , being isolated at the age of 54 , instead converses with God , the Panagia , and the saints . It also shows Makriyannis 's deep religious feeling ; he turns away from guns , instead seeking the nation 's salvation through divine intervention . Furthermore , as Sphyroeras points out , the work is unique in Modern Greek literature in its subject matter , and is , as the Memoirs , a significant source of linguistic and cultural information . = = = Works = = = \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ( Memoirs ) first published : Athens : 1907 \u1f49\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u0398\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ( Visions and Wonders ) first published : Athens : 1983",

                    "text": "Ninian Edwards = Ninian Edwards ( March 17 , 1775 \u2013 July 20 , 1833 ) was a founding political figure of the state of Illinois . He served as the only governor of the Illinois Territory from 1809 to 1818 , as one of the first two United States Senators from Illinois from 1818 to 1824 , and as the third Governor of Illinois from 1826 to 1830 . In a time and place where personal coalitions were more influential than parties , Edwards led one of the two main factions in frontier Illinois politics . Born in Maryland , Edwards began his political career in Kentucky , where he served as a legislator and judge . He rose to the position of Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1808 , at the time Kentucky 's highest court . In 1809 , U.S. President James Madison appointed him to govern the newly created Illinois Territory . He held that post for three terms , overseeing the territory 's transition first to democratic \" second grade \" government , and then to statehood in 1818 . On its second day in session , the Illinois General Assembly elected Edwards to the U.S. Senate , where conflict with rivals damaged him politically . Edwards won an unlikely 1826 election to become Governor of Illinois . Conflict with the legislature over state bank regulations marked Edwards ' administration , as did the pursuit of Indian removal . As governor or territorial governor he twice sent Illinois militia against Native Americans , in the War of 1812 and the Winnebago War , and signed treaties for the cession of Native American land . Edwards returned to private life when his term ended in 1830 and died of cholera two years later . = = Early life = = Ninian Edwards was born in 1775 to the prominent Edwards family in Montgomery County , Maryland . His mother , Margaret Beall Edwards , was from another prominent local family . His father Benjamin Edwards served in the Maryland House of Delegates , in Maryland 's state ratifying convention for the U.S. Constitution , and in the United States House of Representatives , filling a vacant seat for two months . Ninian was educated by private tutors , one of whom was the future U.S. Attorney General William Wirt . He attended Dickinson College from 1790 to 1792 but did not graduate , leaving college to study law . His son Ninian Wirt Edwards wrote later that Edwards spent some of his time at Dickinson reading medicine , a field to which he devoted considerable time in his later years . In 1794 , at the age of 19 , Edwards moved to Nelson County , Kentucky to manage some family land . He showed a great aptitude for business and leadership and was soon elected to a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives , before he was even eligible to vote . In 1802 he was awarded the rank of major in the militia . In 1803 he moved to Russellville , Kentucky , and won a succession of public offices : circuit court judge in 1803 , presidential elector in 1804 ( voting for Thomas Jefferson ) , and judge and finally chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals , which at the time was Kentucky 's highest court . He joined the high court in 1806 and won the leadership position in 1808 . A well-educated landowning aristocrat , Edwards deliberately cultivated the image of the natural leader . Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out of style , and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence . Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and , later , Illinois politics . In 1803 in Russellville , Edwards married Elvira Lane , a relative from Maryland . = = Territorial governorship = = The Illinois Territory was created in 1809 . It included all of what today is the state of Wisconsin , as well as parts of Minnesota and Michigan . Its population was almost entirely concentrated in the south , in the region later known as Egypt . President James Madison first appointed Kentucky politician John Boyle as its governor . Boyle collected his salary for the position for 21 days but then resigned to take Edwards ' job as Kentucky Chief Justice , while friends in Washington helped secure Edwards ' appointment as territorial governor . In the meantime , Territorial Secretary Nathaniel Pope , a cousin of Edwards , had to assume the powers of acting governor , creating Illinois ' first counties and appointing officials to form the new government . Only 34 years old at the time of his appointment , Ninian Edwards is the youngest man ever to govern Illinois as either a state or a territory . Edwards settled in the American Bottom on land he received as a grant upon his appointment as governor . He named his new farm Elvirade , after his wife . Along with his family , Edwards brought a number of slaves , whom he did not free even though the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 had made slavery illegal in the territory . An 1803 \" Law Concerning Servants \" had been promulgated for the Indiana Territory by then-Governor William Henry Harrison that maintained the status of people brought into the territory \" under contract to serve another in any trade or occupation . \" The law , which remained in force in the Illinois territory , permitted slavery to persist for decades under the guise of indentured servitude . Most of Illinois ' early governors were slaveowners , and Edwards was no exception . Later , he may have made extra income by renting some of his \" indentured servants \" out for labor in Missouri . The new territorial governor was sworn in on June 11 , 1809 . At first Edwards tried to avoid partisanship but soon found that faction was an inevitable result of his power to appoint officials and distribute government jobs . Although the First Party System continued to define national politics , the Federalist and Republican Parties never took hold in frontier Illinois . Rather , factional loyalties were created by personality , personal bonds such as kinship and militia service , and especially the distribution of patronage . In the early territorial years , two rival factions grew up around Edwards and Judge Jesse B. Thomas . These two factions formed Illinois ' political landscape during its time as a territory and for its first several years of statehood . = = = Democratic government = = = Throughout Edwards ' three terms as governor , he showed a willingness to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory . Before 1812 , while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status , Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials ; however , he made it his practice to consider local opinion as much as he could when making appointments , often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents . He attempted to do the same for militia officers for a time , letting the men of a unit elect their leaders , but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical . In 1812 , Edwards successfully persuaded Congress to modify a provision of the 1787 Ordinance limiting voting rights to freeholders of 50 acres ( 20 ha ) of land . Due to long-running disputes over fraudulently sold lands , very few Illinois frontiersmen could qualify . At Edwards ' urging , Congress granted the Illinois Territory universal white male suffrage , making it the most democratic U.S. territory at the time . In April , Edwards held a referendum on moving to second-grade government , allowing the people of Illinois to elect a legislature and a non-voting delegate to Congress . The referendum passed , and elections were held in October that sent Shadrach Bond to Washington as Illinois ' first congressional delegate . = = = War of 1812 = = = Edwards had not been governor long when Illinois became the scene of fighting during the War of 1812 . Relations between Illinois settlers and Native Americans worsened throughout the territory during 1810 and 1811 . By June 1811 , Governor Edwards ordered the construction of a series of blockhouses and called out three companies of militia . The declaration of war and the Battle of Fort Dearborn in 1812 convinced Edwards that Potawatomi and Kickapoo in the territory were preparing to launch a major attack on the southern settlements . In his capacity as commander in chief , Edwards gathered 350 mounted rangers and volunteers near Edwardsville and personally led an expedition north to Peoria . After burning two Kickapoo villages on the Sangamon River along the way , the militia advanced on Peoria itself . All told , the short campaign burned several villages and inflicted dozens of casualties before returning . The attack angered both the Peoria villagers and the U.S. government because it had been carried out against Native Americans loyal to Black Partridge and Gomo , two leaders who had not joined Tecumseh 's War and were considered friendly to U.S. interests . A second attack under Captain Thomas Craig killed a large number of French settlers from Peoria as well as Potawatomi . In 1813 , Illinois and Missouri militia joined a force of United States infantry under Benjamin Howard to drive all Native American villagers away from Peoria and establish Fort Clark . Edwards ' actions alienated those Native Americans friendly to the U.S. in the region . Ninian Edwards , having lost the confidence of the Madison administration , waited out the war in Kentucky . However , he was reappointed to a second and then a third term as territorial governor in 1812 and 1815 , and he was also named one of the three U.S. negotiators of the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815 . = = = Second and third terms = = = During his nine years as territorial governor , Edwards made a good deal of money through several profitable ventures , including farming , land speculation , and investment in sawmills , grist mills , and stores . Edwards ' political rivalry with Jesse B. Thomas continued for the rest of his time as governor . Edwards , along with much of the legislature , criticized the territory 's judges for their inactivity . Among their complaints were that the judges did not hold court often enough and spent too much time absent from the territory . The legislature passed a bill in 1814 to reform the territory 's judicial system . The judges refused to acknowledge the act , claiming that they were outside the jurisdiction of the legislature . In 1815 the issue was resolved by Congress , which passed a law supporting Edwards and the legislature . In December 1817 , Edwards , responding to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook , recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union . He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory , a standard practice , but the legislature rejected this . Legislators , particularly those opposed to slavery , feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois , and that since Missouri was a slave state , this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois ' admission even longer . In order to emphasize to Congress that Illinois would be a free state , the legislature passed in January 1818 a bill that would both abolish Illinois ' \" indentured servant \" system of de facto slavery , and prohibit Illinois ' future Constitution from reinstating it . Governor Edwards issued his only veto to send the bill back to the legislature , and it was never revised . He made his objections on constitutional grounds , but he also had a conflict of interest as the owner of several slaves himself . During Edwards ' terms as territorial governor , Illinois ' population more than tripled , from 12,282 in 1810 to 40,258 in 1818 ( a census was finally conducted later that year ) . The population did not meet the 60,000 threshold the Northwest Ordinance required for a new state , but both Illinoisans and Congress expected continued growth . = = Senate career = = Illinois quickly proceeded along the steps to statehood . Its constitution was finished in August 1818 ; elections were held in September ; and in October , the first General Assembly met in Kaskaskia . On October 6 , Ninian Edwards stepped down , and Shadrach Bond was inaugurated as Illinois ' first governor . The following day the new state legislature voted for Illinois ' two members of the U.S. Senate . Edwards was quickly chosen on the first ballot ; his rival Thomas was only elected after the fourth . Edwards and Thomas then drew straws to determine their respective terms : Thomas was placed in Class II of the Senate and could serve until 1823 , while Edwards was placed in Class III and had to face reelection in February 1819 . Edwards and Thomas still had to wait for Congress to formally ratify Illinois ' constitution and admission to the Union , which it did on November 25 . On December 3 the two Senators were finally seated , leaving Edwards with a mere three months in his first term . Edwards ' re-election was more difficult . In four months he had lost the temporary support of Thomas ' allies in the General Assembly who had voted for him in 1818 . He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones by a vote of 23 \u2013 19 . This may have been due to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane , a Thomas ally . Like most members of Congress during the Era of Good Feelings , Senator Edwards sat as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party . As his second term drew on , he joined the Adams-Clay faction that would develop into the National Republicans after Edwards left office . Edwards voted for the Missouri Compromise in 1820 , a bill that Thomas sponsored . He voted against a law reducing prices for federal land , which made both Edwards and Representative Daniel Pope Cook targets of criticism at home . On May 6 , 1821 , Cook married Edwards ' daughter Julia . Ninian Edwards caused trouble for himself when he wrote several articles in the Washington Republican under the pseudonym \" A.B. \" that attacked U.S. Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford . Edwards alleged that Crawford had known of the impending failure of Illinois ' Bank of Edwardsville in 1821 , but had not withdrawn federal money from it . Edwards found that none of Crawford 's rivals were willing to support his charges , and he was unable to produce corroborating evidence . He resigned his Senate seat on March 4 , 1824 , to take a job he wanted as the first United States Minister to Mexico . While en route to his new position , Edwards was called back to Washington to testify before a special House committee concerning the \" A.B. Plot \" . Unable to substantiate his claims , Edwards resigned his diplomatic post , to be replaced by Joel Roberts Poinsett . Back in Illinois , Edwards settled in Belleville , a town whose site he had once owned before selling off its lots at a profit . = = State governorship = = = = = Election of 1826 = = = When he returned to Illinois , Edwards appeared to be a discredited politician . He no longer had a loyal coalition in the General Assembly to re-elect him to the U.S. Senate . His actions in the \" A.B. Plot \" had made him lose favor with President Adams ; therefore he could not expect another federal appointment . In addition , supporters of Andrew Jackson were becoming a force in Illinois politics . Illinois frontier voters so admired Jackson that soon , for the first time , they would give their support to a national party , the Democrats . Ninian Edwards never criticized Jackson , but as an Adams-Clay Republican Senator he was not part of Jackson 's growing coalition . Jacksonians deeply resented Edwards ' ally Cook , who had voted against Jackson when the presidential election of 1824 was decided in the House of Representatives . However , when he ran for governor in 1826 , Edwards had the good fortune to enter a three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator Thomas Sloo and Lieutenant Governor Adolphus Hubbard . As a campaign issue , Edwards focused on Illinois ' dire financial situation , blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it . Edwards won 49.5 percent of the vote to Sloo 's 46 percent , with the rest going to Hubbard . = = = Administration = = = Edwards ' gubernatorial term was another period of rapid growth for Illinois . In the decade from 1820 to 1830 , the population again nearly tripled from 55,211 to 157,445 . During this era , Illinois was the fastest-growing territory in the world . Edwards ' administration was hampered by his conflict with the legislature , primarily over the struggling Bank of Illinois . The bank had been established in 1821 , and from the beginning it had been underfunded , its notes had badly depreciated , and it had helped put the state deeply in debt . In his inaugural address Edwards undiplomatically attacked bank officials and politicians alike , accusing them of fraud and perjury . From that point , Edwards had a poor relationship with the General Assembly . During his term the Assembly did eventually pass a bank regulation bill , but it also passed a measure to relieve debtors despite Edwards ' objections that the state could not afford it . In 1827 Illinois established its first penitentiary , at Alton . That same year , the state received a federal land grant to build the Illinois and Michigan Canal , though work did not begin for several years . Also in 1827 , Edwards ordered the Illinois militia to join another war against Native Americans in northern Illinois . The Winnebago War , fought between white settlers and members of the Ho-Chunk tribe , broke out in Wisconsin ( then part of the Michigan Territory ) but spread to the lead-mining region around Galena . Edwards dispatched the militia and ordered 600 more men to be recruited in Sangamon County . The show of force convinced the Ho-Chunk to surrender . After the war , Edwards urged the federal government to remove the remaining Native Americans from northern Illinois , claiming that their presence violated \" the rights of a sovereign and independent state \" , and hinting that he might dispatch the militia again to force them out . The federal government applied diplomatic pressure , and on July 29 , 1829 , the Potawatomi , Ottawa , and Ojibwe ceded 3,000 square miles ( 7,800 km2 ) of northern land to the State of Illinois ; the Winnebago made a cession in August . = = Later life = = Under the 1818 constitution , governors were limited to a single term . When Edwards ' ended on December 6 , 1830 , he returned to private life . He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1832 and lost . Edwards devoted himself to charitable medical work in Belleville , giving free care to local residents . A cholera epidemic came through the area in 1833 , carried by Winfield Scott 's troops during the Black Hawk War . Edwards stayed in the town to care for his patients and caught the disease , dying on July 20 . Ninian Edwards was interred in Belleville , but he was later moved to Springfield 's Oak Ridge Cemetery . = = Family = = Three of Edwards ' sons and one son-in-law followed him into politics . Ninian Wirt Edwards ( 1809 \u2013 1889 ) , named for his father and his father 's childhood tutor William Wirt , served as Illinois Attorney General , in the General Assembly , and as Illinois ' first Superintendent of Public Instruction . He was married to Elizabeth Porter Todd , a sister of Mary Todd Lincoln . Their daughter Julia Cook Edwards married Edward Lewis Baker , editor of the Illinois State Journal and son of Congressman David Jewett Baker . Another son , Albert Gallatin Edwards ( 1812 \u2013 1892 ) , was an assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln . In 1887 he founded the brokerage firm A. G. Edwards in Saint Louis , Missouri . A third son , Benjamin S. Edwards ( 1818 \u2013 1886 ) , established a successful law practice in Springfield , Illinois and served as a judge in Illinois ' Thirteenth Circuit . Ninian Edwards ' daughter , Julia Edwards Cook , married Congressman Daniel Pope Cook . Their son , John Pope Cook , was a mayor of Springfield and a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War . = = Legacy = = Edwards County , Illinois was named for him , as is the St. Louis , Missouri Metro-East area city of Edwardsville , Illinois . Both were named for him during his time as territorial governor . The territorial legislature named Edwards County , while Edwardsville was named by its founder , Thomas Kirkpatrick . The Edwards Trace , pioneer Central Illinois trail , was named for Ninian Edwards and his War of 1812 campaign .",

                "Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore = Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore guarantees to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law . The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications \u2013 religion , race , descent and place of birth \u2013 upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons . For example , discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . Persons unable to show that one of the forbidden classifications applies to them may try to argue that they are members of a group defined by a law in a way that violates the general guarantee of equality and equal protection . To succeed , they must establish that the classification used in the law fails the rational nexus test , which is a three-stage test formulated by the courts . The first stage of the test involves an examination as to whether the law differentiates amongst classes of individuals . At the second stage , the court considers if the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia or distinguishing feature . Finally , the basis of the differentiation must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . However , the test is not foolproof as a classification may satisfy the test even if the object of the law is itself illegitimate . The rational nexus test , as it is currently applied in Singapore , also tolerates over- and under-inclusive classifications . It remains to be seen if local courts will consider other approaches to the issue , such as the three-tier system of scrutiny applied in the United States , the proportionality analysis applied in the United Kingdom to other areas of human rights law , or the reasonableness approach taken by some judges in India and Malaysia . The rational nexus test does not apply where a statute treats all persons equally , but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner . Instead , a modified rational nexus test is used , which requires a court to consider whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law . Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination . It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency , unless this occurs on a very substantial scale . In addition , inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . = = Text of Article 12 = = Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is entitled \" Equal protection \" and reads as follows : 12 . \u2014 ( 1 ) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law . ( 2 ) Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution , there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition , holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . ( 3 ) This Article does not invalidate or prohibit \u2014 ( a ) any provision regulating personal law ; or ( b ) any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . In the 1998 decision Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong , the Court of Appeal regarded the concept of equality as a component of the wider doctrine of the rule of law , and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states : \" To none will we sell , to none will we deny , to none will we delay right or justice . \" Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying \" to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws \" , and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying \" to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India \" . Article 12 ( 1 ) is identical to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of Malaysia , from which it was adopted following Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 . In Lim Meng Suang v. Attorney-General ( 2013 ) , the High Court noted that the concept of equality before the law is derived from English common law which requires all classes of persons to be equally subject to the law , while the concept of equal protection of the law stems from the US Constitution 's Fourteenth Amendment and guarantees both procedural and substantive equality . The Court said : It will be seen that equality before the law and equal protection of the law are but different aspects of the same doctrine \u2013 equal justice . The first expresses the immutable principle of equal subjection of all classes of persons to the law , and the second is the positive aspect of that principle which reaches out , when invoked , to strike down unequal laws and discriminatory administrative or executive action as unconstitutional and void . = = Discriminatory classification = = = = = Forbidden classifications = = = Article 12 ( 2 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against Singapore citizens ( unlike Article 12 ( 1 ) which applies to \" all persons \" ) \" on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth \" in the following situations : In any law . In the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority . In the administration of any law relating to ( 1 ) the acquisition , holding or disposition of property ; or ( 2 ) the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . The word only raises the possibility that discrimination may be permissible on the basis of one of the proscribed grounds in combination with some other factor , such as age or state of health . Article 12 ( 2 ) is subject to an express contrary authorization by the Constitution . Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure that members of the Malay , Indian and other minority communities are represented in Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) . Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates , at least one of whom must be from a minority community . Article 39A ( 3 ) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12 . Another provision that is rescued from potential invalidity by Article 12 ( 2 ) is the Government 's constitutional mandate to exercise its functions in such a way as to recognize the special position of the Malays , who are the indigenous people of Singapore . The Government has a responsibility to \" protect , safeguard , support , foster and promote their political , educational , religious , economic , social and cultural interests and the Malay language \" . The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate Muslim religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the President concerning matters relating to Islam . The legislation in question is the Administration of Muslim Law Act . = = = Other discriminatory classifications : the rational nexus test = = = Aggrieved persons who cannot avail themselves of the protection afforded by Article 12 ( 2 ) may try to argue that they are a member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . The rational nexus test , also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification , is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory . The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept ; it does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Consequently , a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances , and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law . If there is no such relationship , the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid . = = = = History = = = = In 1909 , the Supreme Court of the United States propounded a test to determine the reasonableness of a classification , stating that the classification \" must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made \" . Based on this principle , the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two-stage test to determine if a classification made by a law was constitutional . The relevant stages were ( 1 ) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia ; and ( 2 ) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question . The Federal Court of Malaysia later adapted the rational nexus test by including an additional preceding stage , namely , whether the law was discriminatory . This three-stage inquiry was accepted in Singapore in the case Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor ( 1996 ) . = = = = Stages of the test = = = = The test that is currently followed in Singapore was re-expressed by the Court of Appeal in Taw Cheng Kong ( 1998 ) as comprising three stages : Whether the law differentiates \u2013 that is , prescribes different treatment \u2013 amongst classes of individuals . Whether the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia ( distinguishing feature ) . Whether the basis of differentiation bears a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . The purpose of the test is to ensure that the right to equal protection is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness . First , individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily . Secondly , the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary . Lastly , the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action . The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness . As such , a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional . = = = = = Stage 1 : Whether the law differentiates = = = = = The first stage of the test considers whether the law prescribes different treatment for one group of individuals as against other groups . For example , in the 1998 High Court decision Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor , Judge of Appeal M. Karthigesu found that the Prevention of Corruption Act differentiated between classes of people as it renders some , but not all , persons open to criminal prosecution in Singapore for offences committed outside Singapore . While earlier cases expressed this stage of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory , the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination . A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people . A discriminatory law or executive act , on the other hand , is one that contravenes Article 12 ( 1 ) and hence is unconstitutional . Therefore , the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory , as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration . If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure , it is a good law and the objection fails . Even if a differentiating measure is found , there is a strong presumption that it is constitutional . The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy . Unless the law is plainly arbitrary , suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality . It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people , and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems , hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds . Therefore , to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily . = = = = = Stage 2 : Intelligible differentia = = = = = The second stage of the rational nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group . To satisfy the second stage , there must be a discernible basis of classification . All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against . Examples of such features include gender , age , race , religion , seniority of professional qualification and area of residence . Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship . Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself , but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects , does not constitute classification . If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently , the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid . If there is an intelligible differentia , the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage . Equality under Article 12 ( 1 ) does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Similarly , failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality . As such , at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally . Article 12 ( 1 ) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others . However , the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against , and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against . The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution , whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it . The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where all members of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally . = = = = = Stage 3 : Reasonable relation to statutory objective = = = = = In this stage , it is necessary to inquire into , firstly , the object of the statute , and secondly , whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object . The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable , taking into consideration the object of the statute , to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation . As such , it is necessary to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute . The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved , and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional . In Taw Cheng Kong , the respondent challenged his conviction for corruption on the ground that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act , which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens ( but not non-citizens ) occurring outside Singapore , discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act 's object , which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it . The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations . = = = = Criticisms of the test = = = = = = = = = Unreasonable legislative objectives = = = = = In equal protection cases , the purpose of the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged . When the purpose of the law is not explicitly stated , the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose , assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it , or draw some inferences as to what it is . When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated , the court may either accept it at face value ; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration , looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose . In the latter situation , what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation . The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the \" thornier aspects of judicial review \" , because it must either \" uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value \" or \" challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference \" . The court must then \" make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end \" . This step is necessary because the rational nexus test is not foolproof . The test is based on the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution . However , if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate , a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test . Hence , the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one . In India , a solution was proffered by means of a more holistic approach to the constitutional promise of equality . In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India ( 1978 ) , the learned Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati noted that \" an essential element of equality pervades Article 14 \" , the equivalent of Singapore 's Article 12 . With that as a starting point , he went on to assert that \" the procedure ... must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary \" . The judge in Maneka Gandhi therefore spoke for a dynamic approach to equality , one that should not be \" subjected to a narrow , pedantic or lexicographic approach \" . This more liberal approach , which accords courts the latitude to deal with legislation backed by arbitrary or unreasonable objectives , was cited with approval in Malaysia by the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram in Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan ( 1996 ) . It is unclear , though , if this test will be applied in Singapore due to a dearth of case law on the matter . = = = = = Over- and under-inclusiveness = = = = = Another problem encountered when applying the rational nexus test is that of over- and under-inclusiveness . Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law . On the other hand , over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective , but also persons outside it . Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test , as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires . It has been argued that this results in the different treatment of persons in like situations , and thus violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object , the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed . However , the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm , to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest , and to advance its policies step by step . Despite this , resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness , if used indiscriminately , may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12 ( 1 ) . Similarly , where an over-inclusive classification is concerned , a rational relation still exists between the differentia adopted and the legislative object . Thus , it is tolerated under the rational nexus test in Singapore . While the effect of an over-inclusive classification may be to accord similar treatment to persons differently placed , courts have nonetheless justified it on the ground that the exigencies of the situation require such classification . The US Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States ( 1943 ) is an example of this principle . Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring , among other things , all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be \" within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. \" and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area . The defendant , Gordon Hirabayashi , was convicted of violating the curfew and the registration requirement . The order was arguably over-inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty . Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens solely on the basis of ancestry \" are , by their very nature , odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality \" , because the US was at war with Japan the race-based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order , which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack . The Court said : \" We cannot close our eyes to the fact , demonstrated by experience , that , in time of war , residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry . \" In Taw Cheng Kong , the High Court was of the view that section 37 ( 1 ) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was both under- and over-inclusive . It did not apply to non-Singapore citizens such as permanent residents and foreigners working for the Government who received bribes for acts which would be done in Singapore . On the other hand , it would catch a Singapore citizen now a foreign permanent resident employed in a foreign country by a foreign government who received a bribe in relation to a transaction that had nothing to do with Singapore . For this reason , Karthigesu J. found section 37 ( 1 ) to be unconstitutional since the nexus between the classification and section 37 ( 1 ) ' s objective was not reasonable enough to justify derogating from Article 12 ( 1 ) . The High Court 's decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal , which held that the under-inclusiveness was not fatal because of the \" overriding need to observe international comity \" . In any case , \" [ t ] he enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency . Such a demand would be legislatively impractical , if not impossible . \" The over-inclusiveness of section 37 ( 1 ) was deemed irrelevant to the constitutional issue because the provision applied equally to all Singapore citizens . = = = = Applications of the rational nexus test = = = = The rational nexus test was applied in Mohamed Emran bin Mohamed Ali v. Public Prosecutor ( 2008 ) , in which the High Court was faced with the issue of whether the failure to prosecute drug enforcement authorities in an entrapment case amounted to discrimination against the persons eventually charged with drug trafficking . The Court found that there was a \" perfectly rational nexus between entrapment operations and the socially desirable and laudable objective of containing the drug trade \" as convicting state agents who carried out covert operations would result in illicit drug suppliers prospering and flourishing while enforcement agencies would \" wither and perish \" . Further , the exercise of the Attorney-General 's prosecutorial discretion was an executive act which satisfied the rational nexus test and was therefore not in contravention of Article 12 of the Constitution . In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor ( 2010 ) , the Court of Appeal had to determine the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes . In that case , the differentiating factor was found in the Misuse of Drugs Act ( \" MDA \" ) , which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than 15 grams ( 0.53 oz ) of diamorphine ( heroin ) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction . Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor ( 2005 ) , which had applied Ong Ah Chuan , the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA . The Court also noted that the \" quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market , but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and , hence , broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender 's crime . \" Although Taw Cheng Kong was not cited in this case , the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in Taw Cheng Kong . = = = = Alternatives to the rational nexus test = = = = In other jurisdictions , courts have applied standards of judicial review more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional . It remains to be seen whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally . = = = = = Three-tiered scrutiny = = = = = In footnote 4 of United States v. Carolene Products Co . ( 1938 ) , Justice Harlan F. Stone opined that where legislation was aimed at \" discrete and insular minorities \" who lack the normal protections of the political process , a more exacting standard of judicial review with no presumption of constitutionality should be applied . At present in the United States there are three different levels of scrutiny . Firstly , if a law categorizes on the basis of race or national origin ( which are regarded as suspect classifications ) , or infringes a fundamental right , strict scrutiny is applied . Accordingly , the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest . In addition , there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest . Secondly , if the law categorizes on the basis of gender , legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications , intermediate scrutiny is applied \u2013 the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest . Finally , the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other , non-suspect , basis . In this case , the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest . In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court of Malaysia referred to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not very different from the traditional rational nexus standard , which it then proceeded to apply . The Court 's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon ( 1990 ) . It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights , and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review . As such , the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia . There are several criticisms of the three-tiered scrutiny analysis , the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being that it does not control judicial discretion : the identification of classifications as suspect , quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests , and political and social interests . = = = = = Test of proportionality = = = = = The test of proportionality in English law , which is applied to determine whether a fundamental right is appropriately restricted by legislation , has three limbs : The legislative objective must be sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right . The measures designed to meet the legislative objective must be rationally connected to it . The means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective . It has been suggested that a proportionality analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three-tiered scrutiny approach . The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test . = = = = = Test of reasonableness = = = = = In Maneka Gandhi , Bhagwati J. appeared to suggest that the rational nexus test should not be applied to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution , which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law , because it led to a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision . He held that Article 14 should not be construed too narrowly as it was the pillar on which the foundation of the Indian Democratic Republic rested . In his view , the principle of reasonableness was an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness , and it pervaded Article 14 \" like a brooding omnipresence \" . A test of reasonableness was applied to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Malaysian Constitution in some cases , but it was later rejected by the Federal Court in Danaharta Urus Sdn . Bhd. v. Kekatong Sdn . Bhd . ( 2004 ) . The Court noted that in cases subsequent to Maneka Gandhi the reasonable classification test had been applied , even by Bhagwati J. himself . Furthermore , equality under Article 8 ( 1 ) does not mean absolute equality , but only assures the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances . The rational nexus test is needed to determine if a law applies equally to all persons in the same group , and is therefore an \" integral part \" of Article 8 ( 1 ) . = = Discriminatory application of laws = = The traditional Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test is inappropriate where the issue is not the existence of discriminatory classification in a statute , but discriminatory application of a neutral statute . This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test as the answer to whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons ( stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test ) will always be in the negative . In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General ( 2009 ) , Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang , delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal , applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test , holding that \" [ t ] he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law \" . Phang J.A. relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1980 ) and Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1990 ) , drawing the following salient points from them : An executive act may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination . Thus , an intentional systematic undervaluation of property would breach Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , though \" something less might perhaps suffice \" . However , absolute equality is not attainable and inequalities arising from \" the application of a reasonable administrative policy \" or \" mere errors of judgement \" are not sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . Inequalities due to \" inadvertence or inefficiency \" need to be on \" a very substantial scale \" to violate the Article . Thio Li-ann has expressed the view that Phang J.A. ' s approach in Eng Foong Ho leaves room for judicial clarification . An important question is whether the \" intentional and arbitrary discrimination \" test , which implies the lack of any rationality , is the sole test for proving that an executive act violates Article 12 , or only one possible test . If it is the only test , then the need to prove the absence of rationality is excessively onerous for the plaintiff to satisfy , compared to the \" reasonable classification \" test . She posits that it is preferable for both the \" intentional and arbitrary discrimination \" test and the \" reasonable classification \" test to apply to executive acts . = = Restrictions on the right to equality and equal protection = = Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . Personal law is the law governing a person 's family matters . In Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v. Fatimah binte Abud bin Talib ( 2009 ) , the High Court identified a number of personal laws , including the Intestate Succession Act which does not apply to Muslims ; and regulations 103 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the Prisons Regulations , which respectively state that Jewish prisoners can claim an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government , and that Muslim prisoners may fast during Ramadan and have their work reduced during this period . A number of private Acts establishing religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions . For instance , a person may only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board , which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments , if he or she is Hindu . Similarly , one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board , which manages gurdwaras ( Sikh temples ) in Singapore , if one professes the Sikh faith . Article 149 ( 1 ) immunizes the Internal Security Act from invalidity due to inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution , including Article 12 . The reference to Article 12 in Article 149 ( 1 ) was enacted by Parliament in 1989 to reverse the effect of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , in which the Court of Appeal expressed the view that sections 8 and 10 of the Act violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . = = Other constitutional provisions = = Article 16 ( 1 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in the administration of public educational institutions ( and , in particular , as regards the admission of students or the payment of fees ) , and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution . This provision is stated to be \" [ w ] ithout prejudice to the generality of Article 12 \" . Article 16 ( 2 ) declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions , but there must not be any discrimination on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws . Article 154 states that all persons who are in the same Government service grade must be treated impartially regardless of their race , subject to the terms and conditions of their employment and to other provisions of the Constitution . The Constitution also establishes a procedure for ensuring that statutes do not contain \" differentiating measures \" , that is , measures which discriminate against any racial or religious community . Most bills that have been passed by Parliament must be scrutinized by a non-elected advisory body called the Presidential Council for Minority Rights ( PCMR ) , which must report to the Speaker of Parliament if it is of the view that any clause in a bill contains a differentiating measure . If the PCMR submits an adverse report , Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval , or decide to present the bill for the President 's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all Members of Parliament . The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in 1970 . = = = Cases = = = Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [ 1978 ] INSC 16 , A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597 , Supreme Court ( India ) .

                "United States constitutional criminal procedure = The United States Constitution contains several provisions regarding the law of criminal procedure . Petit jury and venue provisions \u2014 both traceable to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independence \u2014 are included in Article Three of the United States Constitution . More criminal procedure provisions are contained in the United States Bill of Rights , specifically the Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments . With the exception of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment , the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment , and ( maybe ) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment , all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments . Several of these rights regulate pre-trial procedure : access to a non-excessive bail , the right to indictment by a grand jury , the right to an information ( charging document ) , the right to a speedy trial , and the right to be tried in a specific venue . Several of these rights are trial rights : the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial , the right to confront witnesses at trial , the right to a public trial , the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography , and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself . Others , such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights , have application throughout the proceeding . If a defendant is convicted , the usual remedy for a violation of one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant 's sentence . With the exception of structural errors ( such as the total denial of counsel ) , constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis , although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt . With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation , the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant . Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ( AEDPA ) , these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions . = = Relevant text = = Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three of the United States Constitution provides that : Trial of all Crimes , except in Cases of Impeachment , shall be by Jury ; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any State , the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed . The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides , in relevant part , that : No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . . . . The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence . The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides , in relevant part , that : Excessive bail shall not be required . . . . The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides , in relevant part , that : [ N ] or shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . = = History = = The Supreme Court of the United States issued almost no constitutional criminal procedure decisions for its first century of existence . Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this . First , the Court 's decision in Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment . Second , the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891 . The Marshall Court possessed jurisdiction in criminal cases only via writs of error from state courts , original writs of habeas corpus , and certificates of division from the circuit courts . In three cases involving certificates of division , the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy , but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause . Similarly , the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment . In two appeals from state courts , the Taney Court considered , and rejected , double jeopardy claims arising from the hypothetical prospect of prosecution by the federal and state governments for the same conduct . The first Supreme Court decisions to reverse state criminal convictions for constitutional procedural reasons involved the exclusion of African-Americans for grand and petit juries \u2014 Strauder v. West Virginia ( 1880 ) , Virginia v. Rives ( 1880 ) , Neal v. Delaware ( 1881 ) , Carter v. Texas ( 1900 ) , Rogers v. Alabama ( 1904 ) , and Norris v. Alabama ( 1935 ) \u2014 and the conviction African-American defendants for crimes involving white victims in the southern states : by a mob-dominated trial , as in Moore v. Dempsey ( 1923 ) ; and without counsel , as in Powell v. Alabama ( 1932 ) . = = Pre-trial procedure = = = = = Bail = = = U.S. Const. amend . VIII provides : Excessive bail shall not be required . . . . Stack v. Boyle ( 1951 ) is the only case in which the Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally excessive . There , the Court found $ 50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act . In United States v. Salerno ( 1987 ) , the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984 , which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the determination of the amount of , or the denial of , bail . The incorporation status of the Excessive Bail Clause is unclear . In Schilb v. Kuebel ( 1971 ) , the Court stated in dicta : \" Bail , of course , is basic to our system of law , and the Eighth Amendment 's proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment . \" In Murphy v. Hunt ( 1982 ) , the Court did not reach the issue because the case was dismissed as moot . Bail was included in the list of incorporated rights in McDonald v. Chicago ( 2010 ) , citing Schilb . = = = Grand Jury = = = U.S. Const. amend . V provides : No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger . . . . The Grand Jury Clause applies only to capital and \" otherwise infamous \" crimes . Any crime \" punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary \" is infamous . Only those convicted of felonies , i.e. crimes punishable by greater than one year of imprisonment , are confined to a penitentiary . Any crime punishable by hard labor , regardless of the term or place of imprisonment , is also infamous . Contempt of court , even if punished by greater than one year imprisonment , is not infamous . In Hurtado v. California ( 1884 ) , the Supreme Court held that the Grand Jury Clause was not incorporated to apply to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . If the grand jury right attaches , every element of the charged crime must be submitted to the grand jury . Thus , the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury . But , the government may narrow the indictment without so returning . The Grand Jury Clause does very little , if anything , to regulate the procedures of the grand jury . For example , the Clause does not prohibit a grand jury indictment based solely on hearsay evidence . Non-fundamental flaws with the grand jury , such as a violation of the defendant 's self-incrimination rights or a violation of grand jury secrecy do not trigger a right not to be tried . In United States v. Williams ( 1992 ) , where the Court rejected a rule that would have required \" substantial exculpatory evidence \" to be presented to the grand jury , the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation . The lack of a grand jury does not deprive the court of jurisdiction , and the defendant may waive the grand jury right . = = = Information = = = U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation . . . . A charging instrument is constitutionally sufficient under this clause ( and under the Grand Jury Clause ) if it ( 1 ) \" contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged , and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet , \" and ( 2 ) \" shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead \" double jeopardy in a subsequent prosecution . This right has been incorporated . In a case submitted to a grand jury , the indictment must satisfy this requirement . In cases not required to be submitted to a grand jury , the formal charging instrument is referred to as an \" information \" ( in the federal system and in some states ) or a \" complaint . \" = = = Speedy trial = = = U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial . . . . The Speedy Trial Clause regulates delay between the bringing of a formal criminal charge and / or the pre-trial deprivation of the accused 's liberty and the start of trial . The Clause has been incorporated to apply in state prosecutions . In Barker v. Wingo ( 1972 ) , the Supreme Court announced four factors relevant to the determination of a Speedy Trial Clause violation : ( 1 ) the length of the delay , ( 2 ) the reason for the delay , ( 3 ) whether the defendant demanded a speedy trial , and ( 4 ) prejudice . Applying Barker , the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States ( 1992 ) , which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest . The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice . = = = Venue = = = U.S. Const . Art . III , \u00a7 2 , cl . 3 provides : Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any State , the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed . The perceived abuse of English criminal venue law was one of the enumerated grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence , which accused George III of the United Kingdom of \" transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses . \" The \" where the said Crimes shall have been committed \" language refers to the locus delicti . \" [ T ] he locus delicti must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it . \" Thus , a single crime may often give rise to several constitutionally permissible venues , and venue may be constitutionally permissible even if an individual defendant was never personally present in the relevant state . For example , conspiracy may be prosecuted wherever the agreement occurred or wherever any overt act was committed . For the purposes of constitutional venue , the boundaries of the states are questions of law to be determined by the judge , but the location of the crime is a question of fact to be determined by the jury . The venue provision of Article III ( regulating the location of the trial ) is distinct from the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment ( regulating the geography from which the jury pool is selected ) . The unit of the former is the state ; the unit of the later is the state and judicial district . Unlike judicial districts under the Vicinage Clause , consistent with Article III , Congress may \" provide a place of trial where none was provided when the offense was committed , or change the place of trial after the commission of the offense . \" = = Trial procedure = = = = = Compulsory process = = = U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . . . . The Compulsory Process Clause guarantees the defendant the right to obtain favorable witnesses at trial . For example , the Clause prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses . Similarly , the Clause prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense . The right does not pre-empt reasonable procedural rules . Thus , the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction . = = = Confrontation = = = U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . . In Crawford v. Washington ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars the \" admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial \" unless pursuant to one of the \" exceptions established at the time of the founding . \" \" [ W ] hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial , the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements . . . so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it . \" In Davis v. Washington ( 2006 ) , the Court held that the Clause places no restrictions on nontestimonial statements . Crawford did not completely define the term \" testimonial . \" But , Crawford held that , \" [ w ] hatever else the term covers , it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing , before a grand jury , or at a former trial ; and to police interrogations . \" Laboratory reports of forensic tests are also testimonial , conferring on the defendant a right to cross-examine the analyst who certifies them . Statements made during police interrogation are nontestimonial if circumstances objectively indicate \" that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency \" but are tesitmonial if circumstances objective indicate \" that there is no such ongoing emergency , and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution . \" \" [ T ] he relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter , but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had , as ascertained from the individuals ' statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred . \" One exception established at the founding is if the witness is \" unavailable to testify , and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination . \" Another such exception is \" forfeiture by wrongdoing , \" i.e. where the defendant intends to obtain and obtains the absence of the witness by wrongdoing . Still another exception is \" the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted . \" Another possible exception is for dying declarations , i.e. statements made by a speaker on the brink of death while aware that he or she is dying . = = = Petit jury , impartiality , and vicinage = = = U.S. Const . Art . III , \u00a7 2 , cl . 3 provides : Trial of all Crimes , except in Cases of Impeachment , shall be by Jury . . . . U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . . One of the enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independence accused King George III of \" depriving us , in many Cases , of the Benefits of Trial by Jury . \" Availability Depending on the authorized and actual sentence , upon demand , a criminal defendant has a right to trial by jury . The defendant does not have a right , conversely , to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution . If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months , whether in state or federal court , the defendant has a right to a jury . Further , the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence ( e.g. contempt of court ) . But , the defendant does not have a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions , even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months , as long as the actual sentence does not . Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be relevant to seriousness , but so far the Court has pushed back against expanding the jury right . Impartiality The trial judge has an obligation to ensure an impartial jury , especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection ( including voir dire and for-cause challenges ) , jury sequestration , and jury instructions . For example , this may require the court to permit voir dire on the subject of the juror 's potential racial prejudice . In some circumstances , the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant 's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise . The Sixth Amendment also regulates the availability and use of cause and peremptory challenges . For example , it precludes a jurisdiction from granting the prosecution for-cause removal of jurors who oppose the death penalty . \" The most that can be demanded of a venireman in this regard is that he be willing to consider all of the penalties provided by state law , and that he not be irrevocably committed , before the trial has begun , to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings . \" While a defendant is not obliged to use peremptory challenges to cure a trial court 's erroneous denial of a defendant 's for-cause challenge , if the defendant does so , the defendant may not rely on the error for automatic reversal . Size and unanimity The Supreme Court has held that six-member juries are sufficient and that five-member juries are not . Verdict unanimity is not required for twelve-member juries , but is required for six-member juries . Vicinage The provision requiring that the jury be drawn \" of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law \" is known as the Vicinage Clause . The Vicinage Clause places no limits on the prosecution of crimes not committed within a state . Nor does the Clause prevent a crime from being tried by a jury from a different division ( a subset of a federal judicial district ) within the same district in which the crime was committed . The Third , Fifth , and Sixth Circuits have held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . = = = Public trial = = = U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . public trial . . . . The defendant has a right to have the courtroom open to the public , absent a showing of a substantial government interest that cannot be addressed by alternatives other than closure . The right to a public trial extends to pre-trial matters such as a suppression hearing and jury selection . The Public Trial Clause has its roots in the \" traditional Anglo-American distrust for secret trials has been variously ascribed to the notorious use of this practice by the Spanish Inquisition , to the excesses of the English Court of Star Chamber , and to the French monarchy 's abuse of the lettre de cachet . \" The Sixth Amendment public trial right is held by the defendant , and the excluded public have no ability to assert it . Independently , however , the public has a substantially similar First Amendment right to attend . = = = Self-incrimination = = = U.S. Const. amend . V provides : [ N ] or shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . . While the Self-Incrimination Clause primarily implicates the law of criminal investigations , the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial . Plainly , the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial . Further , if the defendant chooses to testify , the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first . But , if the defendant testifies , she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination within the scope of the direct examination . Similarly , the Clause \" forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused 's silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt . \" This principle applies at the sentencing phase , even after a plea of guilty . While the defendant is entitled to an jury instruction forbidding adverse inferences from his or her failure to testify , a defendant is not entitled to prevent such an instruction . \" Nothing in the Fifth Amendment privilege entitles a defendant as a matter of constitutional right to await the end of the State 's case before announcing the nature of his defense , any more than it entitles him to await the jury 's verdict on the State 's case-in-chief before deciding whether or not to take the stand himself . \" For example , a jurisdiction may require the defendant to disclose intended alibi witnesses before trial . = = Double jeopardy = = U.S. Const. amend . V provides : [ N ] or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . . The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions : subsequent prosecution after acquittal , subsequent prosecution after conviction , subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials , and multiple punishment in the same indictment . Jeopardy \" attaches \" when the jury empaneled , the first witness is sworn , or a plea is accepted . The \" dual sovereignty doctrine \" permits the federal government and each state to proceed separately . Prosecution after acquittal The government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal , whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury , a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury , an appellate reversal for sufficiency ( except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court ) , or an \" implied acquittal \" via conviction of a lesser included offense . In addition , the government is barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal , even if the jury hung on other counts . This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss or other non-merits dismissal , or a directed verdict after a jury conviction , Nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict , if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute . Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after a deadlocked jury , an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency , including habeas , or \" thirteenth juror \" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency on the principle that jeopardy has not \" terminated . \" There may also be an exception for judicial bribery , but not jury bribery . Multiple punishment , including prosecution after conviction In Blockburger v. United States ( 1932 ) , the Supreme Court announced the following test : the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not . Blockburger is the default rule , unless the legislatively intends to depart ; for example , Continuing Criminal Enterprise ( CCE ) may be punished separately from its predicates , as can conspiracy . The Blockburger test , originally developed in the multiple punishments context , is also the test for prosecution after conviction . In Grady v. Corbin ( 1990 ) , the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the Blockburger test was not satisfied , but Grady was overruled in United States v. Dixon ( 1993 ) . Prosecution after mistrial The rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial . If the defendant moves for a mistrial , there is no bar to retrial , unless the prosecutor acted in \" bad faith , \" i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial . If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial , there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \" manifest necessity \" for granting the mistrial . The same standard governs mistrials granted sua sponte . = = Assistance of Counsel = = U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence . The Assistance of Counsel Clause includes , as relevant here , at least six distinct rights : the right to counsel of choice , the right to appointed counsel , the right not to be constructively denied counsel , the right to conflict-free counsel , the effective assistance of counsel , and the right to represent oneself pro se . A defendant does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in any civil proceeding , including a deportation hearing ( even though deportability is often a collateral consequence of criminal conviction ) . Choice of counsel A defendant must be given an opportunity to retain counsel , even if not entitled to appointed counsel . Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest , scheduling , counsel 's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction , and counsel 's willingness to represent the defendant ( whether pro bono or for a fee ) , criminal defendants have a right to be represented by counsel of their choice . The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal . In Caplin & Drysdale v. United States ( 1989 ) , the Court held that there is no Sixth Amendment exception to criminal forfeiture ; i.e. , after conviction , the government can seek forfeiture of already paid legal fees under a forfeiture statute , notwithstanding the effect on the defendant 's ability to retain counsel of choice . Appointment of counsel A defendant unable to retain counsel has the right to appointed counsel at the government 's expense . While the Supreme Court recognized this right gradually , it currently applies in all federal and state criminal proceedings where the defendant faces authorized imprisonment greater than one year ( a \" felony \" ) or where the defendant is actually imprisoned . A defendant does not have a right to appointed counsel if he or she is not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year , even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime , or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment . Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal , or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal , even if facing execution . Constructive denial Whether counsel are appointed or retained , the Clause protects the role of counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship . For example , the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial . And , the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel , or restricting the order in which the defendant may be called as a witness . Further , the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess , even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant . Similarly , the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument , even if a bench trial . Conflict-free counsel Whether counsel is retained or appointed , the defendant has a right to counsel without a conflict of interest . If an actual conflict of interest is present , and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation , the result is automatic reversal . The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived , but some conflicts are un-waiveable . Ineffective assistance of counsel In Strickland v. Washington ( 1984 ) , the Court held that , on collateral review , a defendant may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates both ( 1 ) that defense counsel 's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ( the \" performance prong \" ) and ( 2 ) that , but for the deficient performance , there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different ( the \" prejudice prong \" ) . To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland , a defendant who pleads guilty must show that there is a reasonable probability that , but for counsel 's deficient performance , he or she would not have plead guilty . In Padilla v. Kentucky ( 2010 ) , the Court held that counsel 's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea . To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland , a defendant who rejects the prosecution 's plea offer must show that there is a reasonable probability that , but for counsel 's deficient performance , the offer would have been accepted by the defendant , not withdrawn by the prosecution , and accepted by the court , and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea . Pro se representation In Faretta v. California ( 1975 ) , the Court held that a criminal defendant has the right to knowingly and voluntarily opt for pro se representation at trial . This right is not per se violated by the appointment of standby counsel . There is no constitutional right to self-representation on appeal . = = Clauses of general applicability = = All of the foregoing constitutional provisions apply exclusively to criminal matters . In contrast , the due process and equal protection clauses have substantial application outside of the criminal law . = = = Due process = = = U.S. Const. amend . V provides : [ N ] or shall any person . . . be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . . . . U.S. Const. amend . XIV , \u00a7 1 provides : [ N ] or shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . . . . The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply generally to all stages of criminal proceedings . The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation of all of the foregoing rights ( with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause , the Vicinage Clause , and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause ) to apply in state criminal proceedings . Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness , even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision . Proof beyond a reasonable doubt The due process clauses require that the burden of proof in criminal cases be placed on the government , and that the quantum of proof be beyond a reasonable doubt . In re Winship ( 1970 ) explicitly held that \" the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged . \" But , the state may place the burden of proof for an affirmative defense on the defendant . Erroneous denial of a reasonable doubt instruction is a structural error that entitles the defendant to automatic reversal . Erroneous definitions of reasonable doubt do not require reversal as long as \" taken as a whole , the instructions correctly conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury . \" Instructions on certain evidentiary presumptions against the defendant , if interpreted as conclusive presumptions or as shifting the burden of proof to the defendant , are also unconstitutional ; permissive presumptions are constitutional . In some circumstances , a trial court must separately instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence , in addition to giving a reasonable doubt instruction . The reasonable doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury instructions , but it retains its relevance when the trial judge considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence . On federal habeas review of a state conviction for sufficiency of the evidence , to grant relief , the reviewing court must find that \" upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . \" In a successive , abusive , or defaulted federal habeas review of a state conviction , a defendant claiming \" actual innocence \" must show that \" it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . \" Brady disclosure Brady v. Maryland ( 1963 ) is another significant , specific criminal procedural right guaranteed by the due process clauses . Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory ( or impeachment ) material , within the government 's possession , from the defendant , and there is a reasonable probability that , if such material had been disclosed , the result of the proceeding would have been different ( \" materiality \" ) . Brady is a holistic , rather than piece-by-piece , inquiry . Whether the government acted in \" good faith \" or \" bad faith \" is irrelevant to Brady . But , if the defendant cannot prove that withheld evidence would have been exculpatory , because its import is unknown , to obtain relief , the defendant must instead show that the government acted in bad faith . The government is not required to disclose impeachment material prior to plea bargaining . Whether the government must disclose exculpatory material during plea bargaining is an open question . Mental competence \" It has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him , to consult with counsel , and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial \" consistent with the Due Process Clause . The \" test \" is \" whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him . \" A state may place the burden on the defendant has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence , but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard , such as clear and convincing evidence . The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary . The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial , but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment ( as opposed to civil confinement ) , that the medication is likely to result in competence , and that the medication is necessary to restore competence . A defendant who is competent to stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty , waiving the full panoply of trial rights , but not necessarily competent enough to represent herself at trial in the face of a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation . Prosecutorial misconduct Due process prohibits the prosecution from knowingly using falsehood to convict the defendant , and requires reversal if there is a reasonable likelihood that the verdict was affected \u2014 whether the falsehood is inculpatory or goes the credibility of a witness . = = = Equal protection = = = U.S. Const. amend . XIV , \u00a7 1 provides : [ N ] or shall any State . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . The equal protection clauses has at least three applications relevant to criminal proceedings : a prohibition on selective prosecution on invidious bases , a requirement that jury pools and venires represent a \" fair cross section \" of the community , and a prohibition on the discriminatory use of jury peremptory challenges . Selective prosecution The defendant may move to dismiss a criminal charge on the ground that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race , gender , religion , national origin , illegitimacy , or similar . In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim , the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races . The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts . Discrimination in the jury pool and venire The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the exclusion of persons from selection for a grand or petit jury on the basis of race , regardless of the race of the defendant . Further , the defendant is entitled to a jury pool that represents a \" fair cross section \" of the community . In order to prove a \" fair cross section \" violation , the defendant must show that ( 1 ) a \" distinctive \" ( i.e. , cognizable ) group ( 2 ) is not represented fairly and reasonably in the jury pool in proportion to the community ( 3 ) due to systematic exclusion . Discriminatory peremptory challenges While a defendant is entitled to a fair cross section in the venire , the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury . Yet , the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges in the selection of the petit jury from the venire . In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky ( 1986 ) , the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor 's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges . There are three steps to a Batson inquiry . First , the party opposing the use of a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case . This requires only an inference , not preponderance . Second , the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible , neutral explanation for the challenge . Third , the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual . A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated . If the trial judge erroneously permits the striking of a juror under Batson , and the error is preserved , the only remedy is automatic reversal . If the trial judge erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson , and the juror is seated , the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis . The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim . Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ( \" reverse Batson \" ) . And , Batson applies equally to race and gender .",
                "Threshold issues in Singapore administrative law = Threshold issues are legal requirements in Singapore administrative law that must be satisfied by applicants before their claims for judicial review of acts or decisions of public authorities can be dealt with by the High Court . These include showing that they have standing ( locus standi ) to bring cases , and that the matters are amenable to judicial review and justiciable by the Court . Depending on the interest that the applicant seeks to represent , standing can be categorized as either private or public standing . Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests . In contrast , an applicant who seeks to represent the interests of a larger group or the public at large must establish he or she has public or representative standing . Where private standing is concerned , the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case , but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist : ( 1 ) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case , ( 2 ) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case , and ( 3 ) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated . The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders . The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as , to date , no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review . In constitutional law cases , the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights , and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further . For a decision by a body to be amenable to judicial review , United Kingdom and Singapore law requires the decision to have some public element , and not to relate exclusively to private law matters . The public element is determined by considering if the body 's power stems from a legal source ( the \" source test \" ) , or if the nature of the body is that it is carrying out some public function ( the \" nature test \" ) . If the power exercised by a body has a legislative source , it will ordinarily be amenable to judicial review in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary , but this is not an invariable rule and decisions without a sufficient public element will not be amenable to review . The latter is also the result when a body is regarded has having acted pursuant to a contract between it and the aggrieved party , rather than having exercised its statutory powers . The subject-matter of a dispute must be justiciable before the High Court will hear the case . A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations , and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training , experience and access to materials ; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview ; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of . Nonetheless , a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it , or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue . Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits , the Attorney-General 's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet 's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases , for instance , where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith . = = Introduction = = Before an administrative law claim can be heard on the merits by the High Court , the applicant must satisfy a number of legal requirements which may be called \" threshold issues \" . These include showing that he or she has standing ( locus standi ) to bring the case , and that the matter is amenable to judicial review and justiciable by the Court . = = Standing = = Standing , or locus standi ( Latin for \" a place to stand \" ) , is a threshold requirement that an applicant must satisfy before a court will permit him or her to proceed with a claim for judicial review . Depending on the facts of the case , the applicant has to establish one of the two categories of standing . The applicant seeks to establish private standing when he or she purports to represent his or her own interests . In contrast , the applicant seeks to establish public or representative standing when he or she purports to represent the interests of a larger group of people , or the public at large . Standing is a mixed question of fact and law , which the court determines based on legal principles . The doctrine of standing prevents applicants from burdening the court with frivolous or vexatious claims . This minimizes disruption in the administrative process . When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged , implementation of the decision by the authority may be delayed . Therefore , the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision . Furthermore , since the courts ' resources are limited , restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated . = = = Private standing = = = = = = = Declarations = = = = One of the remedies that may be sought by an applicant for judicial review is a declaration , which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action , based on the facts that have been presented to the court . The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case , but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases . In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General ( 2012 ) , the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge : ( 1 ) he or she must have a real interest in bringing the case , ( 2 ) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case , and ( 3 ) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated . = = = = Prerogative orders = = = = In Singapore , an applicant must have a \" sufficient interest \" in the subject of the application to have standing to apply for a prerogative order , that is , a mandatory , prohibiting or quashing order . Previously , the rule of standing for mandatory orders was stricter than the rule applicable to prohibiting and quashing orders . To apply for a mandatory order , an applicant had to show a specific legal right in the matter . In contrast , an applicant only had to show that \" there had been an abuse of power which inconvenienced someone \" to apply for a prohibiting or quashing order . This rule of standing for prohibiting and quashing orders was relatively easy to satisfy because such orders were often used to ensure good standards of public administration . However , the United Kingdom courts gradually adopted a single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders . In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise , ex parte Cook ( 1969 ) , for example , the High Court used a sufficient interest test to determine whether an applicant had standing to apply for a mandatory order . Singapore followed the UK 's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders . In Re Lim Chor Pee , ex parte Law Society of Singapore ( 1986 ) , the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders . In that case , the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus ( now known as a mandatory order ) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor . The Court , applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners , ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd . ( 1981 ) , held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter , and not whether he or she had a specific legal right . In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts ( 1995 ) , which was a constitutional challenge rather than an administrative law claim , the High Court noted that the sufficient interest test for standing applies to mandatory , prohibiting and quashing orders . It also held that the sufficiency of the applicant 's interest should be judged in relation to the subject matter of the application . On the other hand , when the case came before the Court of Appeal in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts ( 1996 ) , that court held : If a constitutional guarantee is to mean anything , it must mean that any citizen can complain to the courts if there is a violation of it . ... A citizen should not have to wait until he is prosecuted before he may assert his constitutional rights . ... If a citizen does not have sufficient interest to see that his constitutional rights are not violated , then it is hard to see who has . In Tan Eng Hong , the Court of Appeal stated that the same test for standing applies to both declarations and prerogative orders , and read the statements from Chan Hiang Leng Colin quoted above as an implicit acceptance that an applicant must demonstrate the violation of a right personal to him or her to have standing . The Chief Justice of Singapore , Chan Sek Keong , suggested extrajudicially during a 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient interest test with the same rigour as the UK courts . A more stringent application of the sufficient interest test would be in line with the green-light approach that the courts adopt in administrative law . Under this approach , the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the executive to adhere to . Accordingly , the courts may adopt a more discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will unnecessarily curtail the executive 's ability to carry out good governance . = = = Public standing = = = Public or representative standing is standing possessed by an applicant who brings a case on behalf of a larger group of people , or even in the interest of the general public . The applicant need not show that a personal right or interest has been infringed . As long as the represented individuals have , or the public has , sufficient interest in the matter , the applicant will be held to have adequate standing to pursue the case . Whether public standing ought to be accorded at all has been a subject of considerable academic and judicial controversy . It has been regarded by one academic commentator as the litmus test of how liberal the standing rules within a legal regime are . Common justifications for allowing this form of standing include the need to vindicate the rule of law and the need to challenge particularly serious illegality where no individual is peculiarly affected by it . Political accountability alone is said not to serve as a sufficient check on administrative action , and there would be a \" grave lacuna in the law \" if no one has sufficient standing to challenge such action before the courts . On the other hand , proponents of a more \" closed \" and restrictive system of rules of standing point towards the need for increased certainty in the law , as well as the possibility of abuse of process and the conventional argument that there will be an unstoppable flood of litigation . Additionally , it is argued that allowing more applications by persons with weak claims to standing may curtail the efficiency of the executive in practising good governance , as resources would have to be channelled to defending lawsuits . It may also delay the implementation of administrative decisions , potentially resulting in substantial damage to stakeholders involved . = = = = Position in the United Kingdom = = = = Cases in the United Kingdom were previously inconsistent upon the issue of permitting representative standing . Nevertheless , it may now be confidently said that the UK courts recognize , in principle , the doctrine of representative standing , and will apply it in suitable cases . = = = = = Narrow approach = = = = = In R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment , ex parte Rose Theatre Trust Co . ( 1989 ) , the High Court of England and Wales adopted a narrow and more restrictive approach to public standing . Justice Konrad Schiemann held that to have standing , an applicant must expressly or impliedly have \" a greater right or expectation than any other citizen of this country to have that decision taken lawfully \" . On the facts , an individual interested in seeing the remains of a historically significant theatre in London called The Rose preserved and made accessible to the public lacked sufficient interest to challenge the Secretary of State for the Environment 's decision not to list the theatre as a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 . The applicant , a trust company formed by a number of such people , did not have any greater claim to standing than its individual members . Despite the fact that this decision could potentially leave an unlawful act by a minister unrebuked , the judge considered that : ... the law does not see it as a function of the courts to be there for every individual who is interested in having the legality of an administrative decision litigated . Parliament could have given such a wide right of access to the court but it has not done so . ... We all expect our decision makers to act lawfully . We are not all given by Parliament the right to apply for judicial review . In the event that a person lacks standing , there is a possibility that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action . In this scenario , the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings , but the case would actually be conducted by the individual . Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant , because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit . However , the Attorney-General may not consent to lend his name to a relator action . This matter lies entirely within his discretion , and his decision is not considered reviewable by the courts . In addition , it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive , it is overly idealistic to expect his consent to an action against the Government . This makes a relator action an uncertain , and hence an unsatisfactory , means of obtaining relief . = = = = = Broad approach = = = = = In the United Kingdom at present , the mainstream approach towards representative standing is broad and liberal . The focus is on whether illegality or some other ground of review can be shown , rather than the applicant 's relationship to the illegality complained of . If some unlawfulness can be demonstrated , the courts tend to grant a remedy even where the applicant is not directly affected by the executive decision . In R. v. Inspectorate of Pollution , ex parte Greenpeace ( No. 2 ) ( 1993 ) , representative standing was accorded to the environmental campaign group Greenpeace that had challenged a decision about the terms on which the authorities allowed a company to test a nuclear power plant at Sellafield in Cumbria , England . Justice Philip Otton considered that Greenpeace had sufficient representative standing : The fact that there are 400,000 supporters in the United Kingdom carries less weight than the fact that 2,500 of them come from the Cumbria region . I would be ignoring the blindingly obvious if I were to disregard the fact that those persons are inevitably concerned about ( and have a genuine perception that there is ) a danger to their health and safety from any additional discharge of radioactive waste even from testing . I have no doubt that the issues raised by this application are serious and worthy of determination by this court . The high-water mark of according representative standing can be found in R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , ex parte World Development Movement Ltd . ( 1994 ) . In this case the applicant , a non-partisan pressure group called the World Development Movement , challenged the decision of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to award a grant under the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980 on the basis that it was ultra vires and a misuse of public funds . Representative standing was accorded despite the contention that , unlike Greenpeace , neither the applicant nor its members had any direct personal interest in the case , and were merely seeking to act in the interest of potential overseas aid recipients . In giving his judgment , Lord Justice of Appeal Christopher Rose identified the following factors as relevant to ascertaining whether representative standing should be accorded : The importance of vindicating the rule of law . The importance of the issue raised . The likely absence of any responsible challenger . The nature of the breach of duty against which relief is sought . The role of the applicants in giving advice , guidance and assistance with regards to the subject matter of the dispute . In addition , it also appears that an applicant 's subjective motivation is relevant to whether he or she should be recognized as having public standing . If a case is brought out of ill-will or some other improper purpose , the courts will be reluctant to recognize that the applicant has standing , even if there is a public interest in the case being heard . Peter Cane has distinguished between cases where the courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals ( associational standing ) , and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest ( public interest standing ) . Under this analysis , ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded as an example of the former , and ex parte World Development Movement the latter . In 1994 , the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for standing . An applicant should have standing in one of two situations : either in his or her personal capacity , in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ( \" from a debt of justice \" , that is , as a matter of right ) ; or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing . = = = = Position in Singapore = = = = No Singapore cases have yet recognized the standing of applicants who have had no direct personal interest in the subject-matter being litigated . In Chan Hiang Leng Colin , the High Court appeared to accept in theory that every citizen prima facie has the right to apply for mandatory , prohibiting or quashing orders in order to prevent an abuse of power by a public authority , though the Court has discretion to refuse to grant them . In doing so , the applicant may claim to be regarded as a public benefactor , rather than a meddlesome busybody . This seems to support the proposition that a citizen may bring a suit even where he or she has no direct interest in the subject matter of litigation . The court has discretion to accord him or her standing if it considers it in the public interest to do so . Justice Judith Prakash cited the following comments of Lord Justice Hubert Parker in R. v. Thames Magistrates ' Court , ex parte Greenbaum ( 1957 ) regarding quashing orders : Anybody can apply for it \u2013 a member of the public who has been inconvenienced , or a particular party or person who has a particular grievance of his own . If the application is made by what for convenience one may call a stranger , the remedy is purely discretionary . Where , however , it is made by a person who has a particular grievance of his own whether as a party or otherwise , then the remedy lies ex debito justitiae ... She added : \" It was not necessary that the applicant had to have a particular grievance arising out of the order complained about . It was sufficient that there had been an abuse of power which inconvenienced someone . \" On the other hand , in Tan Eng Hong the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between public rights which are \" held and vindicated by public authorities \" and a private right which is \" held and vindicated by a private individual \" . It took the view that \" [ i ] f a public right was involved , the applicant must show that he had suffered special damage as a result of the public act being challenged and that he had a genuine private interest to protect or further \" . Relying on this , in Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v. Attorney-General ( 2012 ) the High Court held that the applicant , who was an ordinary citizen , had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of a contingent loan of US $ 4 billion offered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to the International Monetary Fund to assist the latter in dealing with an ongoing financial crisis and to promote global economic and financial stability . Such a restrictive approach to standing is consistent with the green-light approach to administrative law adopted by the Singapore courts . = = Amenability = = For a decision by a body to be amenable to judicial review , United Kingdom and Singapore law requires the decision to have some public element , and not to relate exclusively to private law matters . The public element is determined by considering if the body 's power stems from a legal source ( the \" source test \" ) , or if the nature of the body is that it is carrying out some public function ( the \" nature test \" ) . There is much debate whether a public \u2013 private divide in administrative law is necessary . It has been contended that such a division has \" turned the law in the wrong direction , away from flexibility of procedure and towards a rigidity reminiscent of the bad old days ... \" . Peter Leyland and Gordon Anthony have suggested that a more desirable alternative presents itself in Northern Ireland , where the test for amenability to review is dependent on the \" public interest \" in the issue . Thus , the public \u2013 private divide does not function at the expense of the legitimate interests of individuals . = = = Decisions with a public element = = = = = = = Position in the United Kingdom = = = = In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( 1983 ) , Lord Diplock stated that for a decision to be susceptible to judicial review , the decision-maker must be empowered by public law , and the ultimate source of power is nearly always a statute or subordinate legislation . However , this \" source test \" ignores many situations where decisions are not dependent on legal rules laid down by the State . This has become an increasing worry in the modern polity as more privatized utilities and private bodies perform governmental functions that could potentially escape any form of scrutiny . This has led to the development of the \" nature test \" . In R. v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers , ex parte Datafin plc . ( 1986 ) , In this case , the issue was whether a body discharging functions that are quasi-judicial in nature and which wields considerable de facto public powers is amenable to judicial review . The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers is an unincorporated association and does not derive its power directly from a legal source such as legislation . Rather , it is an informal body which has adopted a self-regulatory code to govern its members . However , Sir John Donaldson , the Master of the Rolls , observed that the Panel possesses \" immense power de facto by devising , promulgating , amending and interpreting the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers \" and its decisions could lead to sanctions which indirectly affect the rights of citizens . Lord Justice Timothy Lloyd acknowledged that the source test is usually decisive , but disagreed that it is the sole test to determine whether a public body is subject to judicial review . He explained that it is instead helpful to look at the nature of the power \u2013 whether the body in question exercises public law functions or if the exercise of its functions has public law consequences . There remains some uncertainty whether the source test or nature test ought to be the determining test . It appears , though , that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor . It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers . Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person , this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public \u2013 private divide , making the decision not amenable to judicial review . = = = = Position in Singapore = = = = Similar to the United Kingdom 's position , judicial review in Singapore is confined to matters of public law , and the applicable tests are the source test and nature test . The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda ( 2001 ) , where the respondent , an employee with the Land Office , had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning . Her employment contract was later terminated . She complained to various statutory bodies , and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ( \" PSC \" ) , but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated . She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for judicial review against the PSC . In the course of its judgment , the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test is one of the tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review . In addition , it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test . However , the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent 's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment , it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers . Thus , the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review . It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power . In UDL Marine ( Singapore ) Pte . Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. ( 2011 ) , Lai Swee Lin Linda was acknowledged to be the leading authority in Singapore on determining the amenability to judicial review . The High Court said that both the source test and nature test applied in Singapore . In the case , the Jurong Town Corporation ( \" JTC \" ) had leased land to UDL Marine and had declined to renew the lease after its term expired . UDL Marine challenged this decision . The Court held that even though the Jurong Town Corporation Act conferred on JTC the power to lease land , it did not prescribe the terms on which JTC could lease land and the considerations to be taken into account . JTC 's exercise of power to lease land was a private act as it \" was not something a private individual would not be capable of doing \" . The Court added that even though there was an element of public interest , JTC 's decisions had not been \" sufficiently of a public nature \" . In granting and renewing leases , it had been acting just like a private landlord . In the case of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd . ( 2012 ) , the High Court identified various factors to determine if the decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd . ( \" SGX-ST \" ) to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function . These factors include the extent to which the SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix , whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning , and the nature of the reprimand function . Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board , it is an approved exchange under section 16 of the Securities and Futures Act , which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations . Also , SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore 's financial sector . Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company 's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company 's business reputation and the director 's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies . For these reasons , the nature test was satisfied . The Court of Appeal clarified in Manjit Singh s / o Kirpal Singh v. Attorney-General ( 2013 ) that if the power exercised by a body has a legislative source , this will \" ordinarily mean that it is amenable to judicial review in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary \" . However , this is not an invariable rule , and there are situations in which a statutory power is not amenable to judicial review . Examples of these include the powers and duties conferred or imposed on corporations by the Companies Act , and on trustees by the Trustees Act . The Court cited with approval the following passage from R. ( Beer ( trading as Hammer Trout Farm ) ) v. Hampshire Farmers ' Markets Ltd . ( 2003 ) : It seems to me that the law has now been developed to the point where , unless the source of power clearly provides the answer , the question whether the decision of a body is amenable to judicial review requires a careful consideration of the nature of the power and function that has been exercised to see whether the decision has a sufficient public element , flavour or character to bring it within the purview of public law . It may be said with some justification that this criterion for amenability is very broad , not to say question-begging . But it provides the framework for the investigation that has to be conducted . ... [ Emphasis added . ] However , the Court also said : \" Where there is a compelling reason which indicates the absence of such a public element in what is nonetheless a statutory power or duty , there would be no good reason to subject the exercise of such a power or duty , which may already be governed by private law obligations and remedies , to public law remedies in judicial review proceedings . \" [ Emphasis added . ] It has been suggested that the Court of Appeal 's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways : that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether , or if it has an insufficient public element . Neither of these interpretations is without complications . As regards the first interpretation , it may be difficult to conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all . If the second interpretation is correct , there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this . = = = = Exceptions = = = = = = = = = Decisions relating to the internal procedures of Parliament = = = = = It is clearly established that the courts exercise a self-denying ordinance in relation to interfering with the proceedings of Parliament . Section 5 of the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act states : There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament , and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court , commission of inquiry , committee of inquiry , tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament . Section 5 is based on Article 9 of the United Kingdom 's Bill of Rights 1689 : \" [ T ] he Freedome of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parlyament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parlyament . \" On the basis of this provision , and for other reasons , a long line of authorities in the Commonwealth have held that courts are precluded from impeaching or questioning the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament . This is so even if the legal action is brought by , and not against , a member of the legislature . Immunity also extends to independent persons appointed by Parliament exercising their duties in relation to Parliament 's activities . In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd . ( 1994 ) , the Privy Council held that if any exceptions were made unless in the most extreme circumstances , members of the legislature would not know if there would subsequently be challenges to what they are saying in Parliament . Therefore , members would not have the confidence to state fully and freely what they have to say . The Privy Council identified one of the extreme circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis ( 1990 ) . In this case , the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole subject matter of the alleged libel relates to the legislator 's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel . If such an action is not allowed to proceed , not only will there be injustice to the defendant , but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator 's misbehaviour in Parliament . This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible . = = = = = Decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal = = = = = While the High Court has inherent power to judicially review the decisions of inferior courts and other administrative bodies , one High Court judge may not judicially review a decision of another High Court judge , nor may the High Court judicially review decisions of the Court of Appeal . The Court of Appeal does not possess the jurisdiction and power to entertain applications for supervision of a decision made by a Subordinate Court as it has \" no jurisdiction or power to hear any proceeding other than an appeal against a decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction \" . Neither may the Court judicially review High Court decisions . This is because the Court of Appeal is a statutory creation , and section 3 ( b ) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act states that it exercises only \" appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction \" . = = = = = Issues over which judicial review has been excluded = = = = = Even when a decision made by a body possesses some public element , judicial review of the decision may be ousted where a statute expressly excludes the court 's power to review administrative decisions . However , the effectiveness of an ouster clause depends on the facts of each individual case . Examples of statutory ouster clauses in Singapore are section 8B ( 2 ) of the Internal Security Act , and section 47 of the Industrial Relations Act . The latter provision stipulates that any determination by the Industrial Arbitration Court is \" final and conclusive \" and \" shall not be subject to any Quashing Order , Prohibiting Order , Mandatory Order or injunction in any court on any account \" . = = = = = Decisions without legal effect = = = = = It has been held in Singapore that decisions by a public authority without any legal effect are not amenable to judicial review . In Tan Eng Chye v. Director of Prisons ( 2004 ) , a case concerning an application for an order of certiorari to quash the certification by a prison medical officer that the applicant was fit to undergo a caning punishment , the High Court held that not every act of or conduct by a public servant is justiciable by way of a judicial review . The Court agreed with Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case that : For a decision to be susceptible to judicial review the decision-maker must be empowered by public law ( and not merely , as in arbitration , by agreement between private parties ) to make decisions that , if validly made , will lead to administrative action or abstention from action by an authority endowed by law with executive powers , which have one or other of the consequences , mentioned in the preceding paragraph . In addition , the decision must have consequences which affect some person ( or body of persons ) other than the decision-maker , although it may affect him or her too : It must affect such other person either : ( a ) by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable by or against him in private law ; or ( b ) by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either ( i ) he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do so until there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he had been given an opportunity to comment ; or ( ii ) he has received assurance from the decision-maker will not be withdrawn ... The Court held that the report made by the prison medical officer was obviously a decision but that alone did not make him a \" decision-maker \" in the sense explained by Lord Diplock . This was because the officer 's report that the appellant was fit for caning did not have legal effect \u2013 the District Court judge was duty bound to impose the sentence of caning irrespective of what the officer might have said in his report . Hence , it was not a case for judicial review at all . The Court also said that another example of non-decision-making conduct was a police officer arresting a person suspected of committing an offence . This approach was also adopted in Comptroller of Income Tax v. ACC ( 2010 ) . The Court of Appeal held it is trite law that a quashing order will not lie unless a public authority has done something that a court can quash or , in other words , deprive of legal effect . It observed that \" a decision need not in itself have a direct legal effect or consequence before it can be quashed . A decision which operates as a prerequisite to or a step in a process capable of altering rights , interests or liabilities may also be the subject of a quashing order . \" The Court eventually concluded that , \" a quashing order will only lie against decisions which have some form of actual or ostensible legal effect , whether direct or indirect . A mere opinion clearly does not fall within this category . \" At present , the approach in Singapore to decisions without legal effect is less liberal than that in the United Kingdom . It has been said that the English courts \" now take a broad view and it is no longer necessary for a claimant to demonstrate that a decision or action has direct legal consequences upon the claimant \" . For instance , these courts have expanded the scope of matters that fall within the remit of judicial review challenges to encompass even press releases and policy guidance issued by public authorities . This is illustrated by the case of R. ( Axon ) v. Secretary of State for Health ( 2006 ) , in which guidance issued by the Department of Health , alleged to be unlawful and in contravention of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , was amenable to judicial review . Cases of this kind may be explainable on the basis that the actions in question have some indirect legal effect . = = = Decisions having only private effect = = = Private associations and country clubs have no obvious public law function , yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings , such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held to decide if persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations , to ensure that they are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice . It has been suggested that the courts ' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract . The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves , and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract . Accordingly , the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function . The jurisdiction of the courts in reviewing the decisions of such domestic tribunals is of a limited nature . The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held in Dawkins v. Antrobus ( 1881 ) that before a member is expelled from a club for committing an offence against the club 's constitution , the member has to be given proper notice of the meeting , an opportunity to attend the meeting , and an opportunity to be heard . Moreover , the charges made against him and the proceedings must be conducted bona fide , fairly , and in the honest exercise of the powers given to the meeting by the club . However , these conditions having been fulfilled , \" the court has no right to consider whether or not what was done by the meeting was right or whether or not what was decided was reasonable \" . The court will not resolve factual issues as these are within the scope of the tribunal 's inquiry . In Singapore , the position is similar . It was held by the Court of Appeal in Singapore Amateur Athletics Association v. Haron bin Mundir ( 1993 ) that : The function of the courts is to see that the rules of natural justice have been observed , and that the decision has been honestly arrived at . The court has no power to review the evidence for the purpose of deciding whether the tribunal came to a right conclusion . It is not the function of the court when exercising such supervisory jurisdiction to resolve issues of fact which are within the proper sphere of the tribunal 's inquiry . The extent of the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case . Basic norms of fairness in the conduct of disciplinary proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is at stake , where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry , and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her . = = Justiciability = = A legal issue must be justiciable before the High Court will grant an applicant leave to apply for judicial review . Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts . It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication , due to the nature of the litigation process and judicial expertise . The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive . For example , matters of policy or subjective preference , and polycentric public policy issues , are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons . However , justiciability is a concept that eludes precise categorization or definition , and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics . The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged . Nonetheless , the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review . = = = Position in the United Kingdom = = = = = = = Prerogative powers and the supervisory role of the courts = = = = The royal prerogative refers to the exceptional powers and privileges only personally exercisable by the monarch . These important rights , immunities and privileges arguably belong to the Crown , which uses them for the performance of its constitutional duties and the governing of the country . Important prerogatives include : legislative powers exercised through orders in council ( a form of delegated legislation ) ; powers in relation to the conduct of foreign affairs , in particular the making of treaties and declarations of war ; powers in respect of the organization and disposition of the armed forces ; the power to confer certain honours ; the power required by the government in times of emergency , particularly during wartime ; and certain powers in respect of the administration of justice . These powers were generally devolved to the prime minister and ministers . The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control . Thus , Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive . However , in practice , parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective . The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown , coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive , can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people . The possibility of such abuse , coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s \u2013 a period of judicial activism \u2013 led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest in the manner in which prerogative powers had been exercised . = = = = Evolution towards reviewability = = = = Traditionally , the regulation of executive action was met with judicial reluctance to intervene . Certain types of governmental discretion , exercised using prerogative powers , were regarded as beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny because they involved issues of substantive policy . However , developments focused on the substance of the issues at hand , rather than merely accepting that the prerogative power is non-justiciable per se . Simply put , the focus shifted from the source of the power to the subject matter . In Chandler v. Director of Public Prosecutions ( 1962 ) , Lord Devlin stated : \" It is the duty of the courts to be as alert now as they have always been to prevent any abuse of the prerogative . \" Lord Denning , the Master of the Rolls , applied a similar reasoning in Laker Airways Ltd. v. Department of Trade ( 1976 ) and held that prerogative powers were as reviewable as any other power and could not be used by the Government to protect themselves when they were removing the protection granted to parties under a statute . He stated , obiter , as follows : The law does not interfere with the proper exercise of discretion by the executive in those situations : but it can set limits by defining the bounds of the activity : and it can intervene if the discretion is exercised improperly or mistakenly . That is a fundamental principle of our constitution . ... Seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good , it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive . In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board , ex parte Lain ( 1967 ) , it was held that the powers of the Board were in principle reviewable , despite it having been established under prerogative powers . This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case , which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom . In this case , their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law ( or the prerogative ) rather than a statutory source . It was the subject-matter that counted , not the source . In this case , the Government , through an order in council , banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union . The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable , and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed . However , although the failure to consult the unions was unfair , this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable . In GCHQ , Lord Scarman cited the authority of ex parte Lain and R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Hosenball ( 1977 ) in stressing that the modern law of judicial review had overwhelmed the old restrictions on the justiciability of the prerogative : [ T ] he law relating to judicial review has now reached the stage where it can be said with confidence that , if the subject matter in respect of which prerogative power is exercised is justiciable , that is to say if it is a matter upon which the court can adjudicate , the exercise of the power is subject to review in accordance with the principles developed in respect of the review of the exercise of statutory power . ... Today , therefore , the controlling factor in determining whether the exercise of prerogative power is subject to judicial review is not its source but its subject matter . The legal implications of GCHQ were that many areas once considered unreviewable were now potentially open to judicial scrutiny by the United Kingdom courts , except for a list of prerogatives that Lord Roskill provided as being non-reviewable \" because their nature and subject matter are such as not to be amenable to the judicial process \" . These included prerogative powers of treaty-making , the defence of the realm , the prerogative of mercy , the granting of honours , the dissolution of parliament , and the appointment of ministers . Subsequent case law shows that this list has largely been accepted , and there is indication that the judges have continued to move with a degree of circumspection , and sometimes even in reaction against such developments . However , in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament v. Prime Minister ( 2002 ) , Justice Maurice Kay accepted that the ambit of the \" forbidden areas \" identified by Lord Roskill is not immutable , and had been reduced in some cases . The attitude of the courts in the United Kingdom is summarized in the obiter comments of Lord Justice Simon Brown in R. v. Ministry of Defence , ex parte Smith ( 1995 ) : To my mind only the rarest cases would today be ruled strictly beyond the court 's purview \u2013 only cases involving national security properly so called and where in addition the courts really do lack the expertise or material to form a judgment on the point at issue . = = = Position in Singapore = = = = = = = Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs = = = = Justiciability was applied as a threshold issue in Singapore in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) . Here , the appellants were arrested for allegedly being involved in a Marxist conspiracy to undermine the Government , and were issued detention orders under section 8 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Internal Security Act . The respondents submitted that \" as the subject matter in ss 8 and 10 of the ISA relates to matters of national security the court is precluded from reviewing the exercising of such discretion since matters of national security should be left to those responsible for it . \" The Court of Appeal agreed with this submission , stating that while an exercise of discretion is generally subject to judicial review on objective grounds , a court will be precluded from reviewing a decision that was made for national security purposes . This position was consistent with the holdings in The Zamora ( 1916 ) and the GCHQ case . The Court added that there is a need for the decision-maker to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved . A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves national security does not preclude the court 's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds of national security . In other words , national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all . However , what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires . This is to be left solely to those responsible for it . On the facts , the Court held that a plain reading of section 8 of the ISA suggests that where a decision is made that it is \" necessary \" to detain someone \" with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore \" , the decision will clearly be based on national security considerations . Whether detention is necessary is a matter solely for the executive 's judgment . However , the courts can still review the decision in terms of whether the exercise of discretion fell within the scope of section 8 . = = = = Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co . Ltd. and subsequent developments = = = = The law relating to justiciability was discussed comprehensively by Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon in the High Court decision Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co . Ltd . ( 2007 ) . After examining a line of cases , the judge laid down the following principles . = = = = = Principles concerning justiciability = = = = = First , there are provinces of executive decision-making that are and should be immune from judicial review . This is reflected the doctrine of separation of powers embedded in Singapore 's Westminster constitutional framework . Secondly , the span of executive decisions immune from judicial review include those involving matters of \" high policy \" , such as the dissolution of Parliament , the conduct of foreign affairs , the making of treaties , matters pertaining to war and the deployment of armed forces , and national defence . Deference should be accorded to the executive branch in respect of decisions concerning these matters . The High Court examined three cases which fall comfortably within this class . In The Fagernes ( 1927 ) the Court of Appeal of England and Wales considered the question of determining territorial boundaries , and held that \" any definitive statement from the proper representative of the Crown as to the territory of the Crown must be treated as conclusive \" . Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A. M. Luther v. James Sagor & Co . ( 1921 ) and Civil Aeronautics Administration v. Singapore Airlines Ltd . ( 2004 ) involved the recognition of sovereign status . It was held in Singapore Airlines that \" a question such as that which arises in the present case , whether an entity is a State so as to enjoy sovereign immunity in Singapore , is eminently a matter within the exclusive province of the Executive to determine , as what are involved in the question are not only matters of fact but also matters of policy \" . Thirdly , apart from issues of foreign affairs and national defence , there are other areas that are non-justiciable such as the interpretation of international treaties operating solely on the international plane . This is illustrated by Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , in which it was held that for the court to assume jurisdiction in such areas would be an \" exorbitant arrogation of adjudicative power \" , as the court could not presume that its ruling would bind other states . Another non-justiciable area is where the legislature has made it clear that a particular question is reserved to the executive to answer , as in Singapore Airlines which noted that section 18 of the State Immunity Act requires those claiming sovereign immunity from lawsuits to first obtain certification from the Singapore Government . In such situations , it is not for the court to disregard the executive 's judgment . Judicial Commissioner Menon rejected a highly rigid and categorical approach to determining the justiciability of an issue , because the theory of the separation of powers is to be interpreted and applied sensibly . The intensity of the review depends on the context behind it and upon common sense . This was the approach taken in Marchiori v. Environment Agency ( 2002 ) which noted that \" one context will shade into another \" . He highlighted four principles that bear noting when determining whether an issue is justiciable : Subject matter . First , the justiciability of an issue depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of decision-making power . This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . Where the executive has the best access to available materials , its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive . It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines that there may be matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive . Where sensitive facts are concerned , Singapore 's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial . Furthermore , not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court . Ability of judges to balance competing policy considerations . Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations , judges may be ill-equipped to decide because of their limited training , experience and access to materials . Thus , the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions . This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held that the type of evidence admissible in the judicial process and the way in which it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another . Embarrassing or tying the hands of the executive . The court should abstain from interfering where a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview . In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant 's true purpose for seeking the court 's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government 's freedom in relation to the use of military force and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance . Thus , the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable . Areas entrusted to the democratically elected branches . The court should always exercise restraint and keep in mind the fact that the Singapore system of government operates within the framework of three co-equal branches , and there are areas of prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of . Marchiori explained that \" the graver a matter of State and the more widespread its possible effects , the more respect will be given , within the framework of the constitution , to the democracy to decide its outcome \" . In such instances , the executive and legislature are accountable to the electorate , not the judiciary . Those who are unsatisfied should sound their dissatisfaction in the ballot box . In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants , which were in Hong Kong , challenged the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground , among others , that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People 's Republic of China . Thus , although this was not a judicial review case , the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong , and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy . Rather , it was concerned with the effect , and not the making , of the treaty or whether it was advisable . Thus , the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power , but merely a statement of opinion . Furthermore , the appeal did not engage foreign policy considerations . The treaty was a civil convention between two countries and an agreement to render mutual judicial assistance , and had nothing to do with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties . It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs , because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong . When interpreting the treaty , the Court only had to determine the domestic legal obligations of the respondents seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction . Thus , the issue of whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong was justiciable , and the Ministry 's letter was not decisive on the matter . = = = = = Justiciability of prosecutorial discretion = = = = = Article 35 ( 8 ) of the Constitution of Singapore empowers the Attorney-General to institute , conduct or discontinue any criminal proceedings . This provision confers wide discretionary powers upon the Attorney-General . However , since unfettered discretion contradicts the rule of law , the Attorney-General 's powers are not absolute and are subject to legal limits . In Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis ( 2008 ) , a three-judge bench of the High Court consisting of Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong , Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang and Justice Andrew Ang held that although the prosecutorial power is a constitutional power , it is not absolute and its exercise can be challenged in \" very exceptional case [ s ] \" . The Court held that it can judicially review the exercise of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power , for example , if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed . A prosecution can also be found to have infringed the accused person 's constitutional rights . This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes , and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers , as this may infringe the accused persons ' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution . = = = = = Justiciability of the clemency power = = = = = Traditionally at common law , the prerogative of mercy \u2013 that is , the power of the executive government to pardon or to grant clemency to a convicted criminal \u2013 was regarded as outside the courts ' supervisory jurisdiction and hence non-justiciable . This changed with the Divisional Court 's decision in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Bentley ( 1993 ) , which held that the prerogative of mercy is reviewable in some circumstances . This case was considered by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General ( 2011 ) , Chief Justice Chan expressing the opinion that the case \" clearly decided that the prerogative of mercy would be reviewable if it were exercised based on an error of law ( in that case , the Home Secretary \u2019 s misconstruction of the type of pardon which the Home Office could grant ) , or based on arbitrary and / or extraneous considerations \" , though courts still cannot review the merits of any clemency decision . In Yong Vui Kong , the Court described the clemency power in Singapore as vested exclusively in the executive , and thus not justiciable on the merits . Despite this , it is not an \" extra-legal \" power that is beyond any legal constraints . Agreeing with Tan Guat Neo Phyllis , the Court held that the clemency power is subject to judicial review if it can be shown to have been exercised unconstitutionally , in bad faith or for extraneous purposes . In addition , the fact that Article 22P ( 2 ) of the Constitution stipulates specific procedural safeguards in death penalty cases indicates that the clemency power must be reviewable to ensure that these safeguards have been complied with . Article 22P ( 2 ) requires documents from the trial judge and the appellate court , and the Attorney-General 's opinion on the case , to be sent to the Cabinet for consideration so that it can advise the President on the exercise of the clemency power . These procedural requirements imply that Cabinet has a constitutional duty to consider the documents in good faith before advising the President . If evidence is adduced to show that the Cabinet did not consider the offender 's case impartially and in good faith ( for example , it never met to discuss the case , or tossed a coin instead of properly considering the materials transmitted to it ) , Cabinet would have breached Article 22P ( 2 ) . In such a situation , the courts must be able to review the clemency decision . This conclusion is also mandated by the guarantee in Article 9 ( 1 ) of the Constitution that a person may not be deprived of either life or personal liberty save in accordance with law . = = = = = Exceptions = = = = = Even if the subject-matter of a case is generally non-justiciable , there are exceptions where the courts will still review the case . For instance , a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but , on a closer look , the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it . In such a situation , the courts will intervene and review the case . An example of this was given by Judicial Commissioner Menon in Lee Hsien Loong : \" [ W ] here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on the application of domestic law , that is something the court may well find justiciable . \" In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , the court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on the interpretation of a treaty generally , which is impermissible , from the consideration of \" the application of an international treaty by reference to the facts of an individual case \" which is allowed . Also , in R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , ex parte Everett ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal of England and Wales took the view that a decision by the Secretary of State exercised under the royal prerogative to deny a passport to a British citizen residing abroad raised a justiciable issue because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but \" a matter of administrative decision , affecting the rights of individuals and their freedom of travel \" . Judicial Commissioner Menon also mentioned another exception to the justiciability rule : when the courts are able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue . However , the judge did not explain this exception further , and it has not yet been applied or discussed in any other Singapore case . = = = Cases = = = = = = = Singapore = = = = Re Lim Chor Pee , ex parte Law Society of Singapore [ 1985 \u2013 1986 ] S.L.R.

                "Article 15 of the Constitution of Singapore = Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore guarantees freedom of religion in Singapore . Specifically , Article 15 ( 1 ) states : \" Every person has the right to profess and practise his religion and to propagate it . \" The terms profess , practise and propagate are not defined in the Constitution , but cases from Singapore and other jurisdictions may shed light on their meaning . The word profess in relation to a religion was defined in a 1964 Singapore case not involving the Constitution as meaning \" to affirm , or declare one 's faith in or allegiance to \" . A 2001 Malaysian decision suggested that the profession of religion does not encompass the renunciation of a religion or the profession of an irreligious viewpoint . As regards the word propagate , in 1977 the Supreme Court of India held that it confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread his or her religion by an exposition of its tenets , but not the right to convert another person who holds a pre-existing religious belief to one 's own religion . These issues have not yet come before the Singapore courts for determination . On the other hand , in 1999 the Court of Appeal attempted to draw a line between religious practices and secular facts , taking the view that singing the National Anthem and saying the National Pledge were the latter . Thus , rules that compelled a teacher to engage in these activities in an educational institution could not be regarded as having infringed his right to practise his religion . Freedom of religion under Article 15 ( 1 ) is not absolute as it is qualified by Article 15 ( 4 ) of the Constitution , which provides that the rights secured by Article 15 do not authorize any act contrary to any general law relating to public order , public health or morality . These limitations upon the freedom of religion are an important aspect of Singapore 's secularism . The Singapore courts have interpreted the term public order to be equivalent to the concepts of \" public peace , welfare and good order \" referred to in section 24 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Societies Act ( Cap . 311 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , rather than taking the narrower view that public order means freedom from unlawful physical violence . There has also been academic criticism of the fact that the courts have not applied any form of balancing test to determine whether freedom of religion has been reasonably restricted . On the contrary , where national security is said to be involved , the courts have deferred to the Government as to the necessity for the restrictive legislation . The terms public health and morality in Article 15 ( 4 ) have yet to be judicially interpreted . = = Text of Article 15 = = Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is entitled \" Freedom of religion \" and reads as follows : 15 . \u2014 ( 1 ) Every person has the right to profess and practise his religion and to propagate it . ( 2 ) No person shall be compelled to pay any tax the proceeds of which are specially allocated in whole or in part for the purposes of a religion other than his own . ( 3 ) Every religious group has the right \u2014 ( a ) to manage its own religious affairs ; ( b ) to establish and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes ; and ( c ) to acquire and own property and hold and administer it in accordance with law . ( 4 ) This Article does not authorise any act contrary to any general law relating to public order , public health or morality . In Nappalli Peter Williams v. Institute of Technical Education ( 1999 ) , the Court of Appeal affirmed that the Constitution generally adopts what is known as accommodative secularism by \" removing restrictions to one 's choice of religious belief \" . Article 15 ( 1 ) is in pari materia with Article 11 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of Malaysia , from which it was adopted following Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 . The latter states : \" Every person has the right to profess and practice his religion and , subject to clause ( 4 ) , to propagate it . \" Article 15 ( 1 ) also contains similarities to Article 25 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of India : \" Subject to public order , morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part , all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess , practise and propagate religion . \" = = Meaning of profess , practise and propagate = = = = = Profess = = = The word profess in Article 15 ( 1 ) is not defined in the Constitution , but the case Re Mohamed Said Nabi , deceased ( 1964 ) may provide guidance . The issue in the case was the meaning of the word Muslim in the Muslims Ordinance 1957 which was defined as \" a person who professes the religion of Islam \" . The High Court held that to come within the definition , one must be shown to be an orthodox Muslim and must have outwardly manifested and practiced Islam ; merely having been born into that religion was insufficient . More specifically , Justice F.A. Chua referred to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and noted that the word profess means \" to affirm , or declare one 's faith in or allegiance to ( a religion , principle , God or Saint etc . ) \" . However , to determine if one has in fact \" professed \" a religion , a proper scrutiny of the entire circumstances is necessary . On the facts , the deceased was brought up as a Muslim , married under Muslim rites , and had held Muslim religious ceremonies in his house which he had taken part in . This was strong evidence that he professed the religion of Islam , despite the fact that he had also engaged in the heterodox practices of drinking alcohol and eating pork . The judge held that such practices did not amount to a renunciation of the religion , and added that someone who had been born into the religion must be held to be a member of that religion unless it is proved he has adopted some other religion . The Malaysian interpretation of the term profess in Article 11 ( 1 ) of the Malaysian Constitution may be relevant as that provision is worded similarly to Article 15 ( 1 ) of the Singapore Constitution . In Daud bin Mamat v. Majlis Agama Islam ( 2001 ) , it was held that the act of exiting one 's religion does not fall under the meaning of professing and practising one 's religion . In the judge 's view , \" to accept that professing no religion equated to ' a religion ' or the ' right to profess and practice it ' would stretch the definition in Article 11 too far \" . On the other hand , it might be argued that the freedom to renounce one 's religion or to profess not to have a religion is a corollary of the freedom to profess a religion . This issue has not yet come before the Singapore courts for determination . = = = Practise = = = The Constitution is also silent on what constitutes practising a religion for the purposes of Article 15 ( 1 ) . The local courts have defined the word practise by indicating what types of acts are not considered religious practices . In Nappalli , the Court of Appeal held that singing of the National Anthem and reciting the National Pledge were not religious practices but rather expressions of national patriotism , which were secular acts . The Canadian case Donald v. The Board of Education for the City of Hamilton ( 1945 ) was distinguished ; in that case , singing the national anthem was held to constitute a religious practice because the anthem contained a prayer hymn which \" unquestionably reflected some religious character \" . In Nappalli , the appellant was dismissed from an educational institution for his refusal to participate in the aforementioned acts . Central to his claim was the submission that these acts were religious practices that went against his belief as a Jehovah 's Witness and thus infringed his constitutional right to practice and profess his religion guaranteed by Article 15 . However , the Court held that since \" religion \" in Singapore under the Constitution is restricted to \" a citizen 's faith in a personal God \" and does not include \" a system of belief in one 's own country \" , the acts in question were not religious practices . Hence , the appellant 's rights had not been contravened . The Court took the view that \" the appellant 's interpretation of the pledge and anthem ceremony as a religious ceremony was a distortion of secular fact into religious belief \" . If the appellant 's interpretation was correct , this would result in Article 15 ( 1 ) losing operative effect , for \" [ h ] ow can the same Constitution guarantee religious freedom if , by asking citizens to pledge their allegiance to country , it is ( as the appellant suggests ) coercing participation in a religious ceremony ? This excruciatingly absurd interpretation cannot have been what was envisaged by the authors of the Constitution . \" The courts in Malaysia have taken a similar approach in defining the meaning of religious practice under Article 11 of the Malaysian Constitution . Furthermore , they have also consulted religious texts to determine what type of acts might constitute religious practices . In Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission , Malaysia ( 1992 ) , the appellant claimed she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment due to her refusal to comply with employment conditions that prohibited any attire that covered a female public servant 's face while on duty . According to the appellant , this contravened her right to religious practice on grounds that the wearing of the purdah was part of her religious practice as a Muslim . However , the court disagreed and held that the purdah was not considered a religious practice as it was not a requirement under Islam since there was no express mention of such a requirement in the Quran . However , in the Philippines , the courts have accorded the individual autonomy to decide what constitutes religious practice . It is up to the individual to decide what constitutes religious practice so long as such acts do not offend public interest . This was the view proffered in Ebralinag v. Superintendent of Schools of Cebu ( 1993 ) , in which the issue was whether the petitioners , who were Jehovah 's Witnesses , ought to be expelled from schools for refusing to salute the flag , sing the national anthem and recite the oath of allegiance as required by the Republic Act No. 1265 of 11 July 1955 and other legislation . Cruz J. held that the state could not interpret the Bible for the petitioners as \" only they can read it as they see fit . Right or wrong , the meaning they derive from it cannot be revised or reversed except perhaps by their own acknowledged superiors . But certainly not the State . It has no competence in this matter . \" = = = Propagate = = = Singapore courts have not yet interpreted the word propagate in Article 15 ( 1 ) of the Constitution . Article 25 ( 1 ) of the Indian Constitution , which is in the same terms as in Article 15 ( 1 ) of the Singapore Constitution , guarantees to individuals the right to freely \" profess , practise and propagate \" their religions . The term propagate was considered by the Supreme Court of India in Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh ( 1977 ) . The Court adopted a dictionary definition of propagate , which was \" to transmit or spread from person to person or from place to place \" . Accordingly , it held that the word as used in Article 25 ( 1 ) confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread one 's religion by an exposition of its tenets . In other words , an individual has the right to spread his or her religion by explaining to others the principles and beliefs underlying that particular religion . However , in the Court 's opinion Article 25 ( 1 ) does not confer the right to convert another person who holds a pre-existing religious belief to one 's own religion as this would impinge on the \" freedom of conscience \" provided for in the Article , which accords each individual with the freedom to hold or consider a thought , fact or viewpoint independent from those of others . In short , the constitutional right to propagate one 's own religion is protected insofar as an individual who exercises this right respects the freedom of persons following other religions . The Indian jurist Hormasji Maneckji Seervai has criticized Stanislaus and has said it should be overruled . He argued that when a person propagates his religion to another , that act does not violate the other person 's free conscience but allows that person an opportunity to freely choose a religion : The right to propagate religion gives a meaning to freedom of choice , for choice involves not only knowledge but an act of will . A person cannot choose if he does not know what choices are open to him . To propagate religion is not to impart knowledge and to spread it more widely , but to produce intellectual and moral conviction leading to action , namely , the adoption of that religion . Successful propagation of religion would result in conversion . = = Restrictions on the freedom of religion = = Under Article 15 ( 4 ) of the Constitution , a person 's freedom of religion can be restricted by a general law relating to public order , public health or morality . The term general law is not defined in the Constitution , but may refer to a law that applies to all persons or places belonging to a particular class . The restrictions on freedom of religion are an important reflection of Singapore 's secularism . Although the Constitution does not express the doctrine of secularism explicitly , the report of the 1966 Constitutional Commission described Singapore as a \" democratic secular state \" . Singapore 's secularism is similar to France 's secularism in that both models seek to \" protect the state from religion \" . However , unlike in Singapore , the principle of secularism in France is constitutionally expressed . In being secular , the Government of Singapore does not reject religion . Instead , it has been said to practise \" accommodative secularism \" . The Government 's adherence to secularism has been criticized in that the unwritten principle of secularism has trumped the constitutional protection of freedom of religion . For instance , in 2002 a controversy arose upon the suspension of four Muslim girls from school when their parents insisted that they wear the tudung ( Islamic headscarf ) to national schools . Section 61 of the Education Act empowers the Minister for Education to regulate schools , including prohibiting students from wearing anything not forming part of an official school uniform . The parents of the schoolgirls took the view that the Ministry of Education 's school uniform policy was unconstitutional as it violated the girls ' freedom of religion under Article 15 ( 1 ) . While the parents eventually did not pursue legal proceedings against the Ministry , the controversy showed the Singapore Government 's steadfastness in insisting on secularism and the difficulties in reconciling secularism and freedom of religion in Singapore . = = = Meaning of public order , public health and morality = = = = = = = Public order = = = = The term public order is not defined in the Constitution but has been judicially deliberated in a series of important legal cases involving the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses . In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor ( 1994 ) , the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah 's Witnesses by Order No. 179 / 1972 made pursuant to section 24 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Societies Act . This provision allows for the dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to public peace , welfare or good order . The Minister had also made Order No. 123 / 1972 and Order No. 405 / 1994 pursuant to section 3 ( 1 ) of the Undesirable Publications Act , prohibiting publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah 's Witnesses . The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications . They appealed and sought to challenge the constitutionality of the Minister 's prohibition order and the deregistration of the Jehovah 's Witnesses , arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15 ( 1 ) of the Constitution had been infringed . Counsel for the appellants submitted that the Jehovah 's Witnesses in Singapore were a small , non-violent group and that there was no evidence their activities were against public order in any manner . He relied on the Malaysian case Tan Boon Liat v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri , Malaysia ( 1976 ) , which considered the meaning of public order in the context of section 4 ( 1 ) of the Emergency ( Public Order and Prevention of Crime ) Ordinance 1969 ( Malaysia ) : The expression ' public order ' is not defined anywhere but danger to human life and safety and the disturbance of public tranquillity must necessarily fall within the purview of the expression ... [ T ] he test to be adopted in determining whether an act affects law and order or public order is this : Does it lead to disturbance of the current of life of the community so as to amount to disturbance of the public order or does it affect merely an individual leaving the tranquillity of the society undisturbed ? Chief Justice Yong Pung How rejected this conception of public order . He noted that Singapore had a policy of compulsory military service known as National Service , and that the Minister had taken the view that the continued existence of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses , which held the belief that military service was forbidden , was contrary to public peace , welfare and good order . As such , since the Minister had formed the view that the Jehovah 's Witnesses were a threat to national security , it was not open to the court to take a different view on the matter . Yong C.J. said in his judgment : \" I could not see how the concept of public order as envisaged under Art 15 ( 4 ) is dissimilar to the notion of public peace , welfare and good order within s 24 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Societies Act . \" He emphasized that the right to religious freedom was not an absolute right as it was subject to the inherent limitations set out in Article 15 ( 4 ) . The right of freedom of religion had to be reconciled with the \" right of the state to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace , security and orderly living , without which the constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery \" . Accordingly , the appeal was dismissed . In 1995 , the Minister for Information and the Arts made Order No. 405 / 1995 banning materials published by the International Bible Students Association , an organization associated with the Jehovah 's Witnesses . In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts ( 1995 ) , the plaintiffs sought leave to apply for an order of certiorari to quash the order , alleging that it was ultra vires as it contravened , among other things , Article 15 ( 1 ) of the Constitution . Presiding over the case in the High Court , Justice Judith Prakash referred to Yong C.J. ' s holding in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. ( 1994 ) concerning the meaning of public order . In a 1995 commentary on Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. ( 1994 ) , Professor Thio Li-ann noted that in other jurisdictions a lack of public order includes the notion of \" endangerment to human life and safety as well as the disruption of public tranquillity \" , and argued that \" [ t ] o establish that public order is threatened , it appears that some degree of violence or unlawful physical violence must be shown \" . Using this as a point of reference , she criticized Yong C.J. ' s equation of public order with \" public peace , welfare or good order \" . = = = = Public health and morality = = = = The Singapore courts have not yet interpreted the meaning of the terms public health and morality in Article 15 ( 4 ) . The UK case of R. ( Ghai ) v. Newcastle City Council ( 2009 ) is therefore interesting for purposes of comparison . The claimant , an orthodox Hindu , applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional open air funeral pyres . The local authority refused the request , relying on subsidiary legislation that made it an offence to burn human remains other than in a crematorium . The claimant then applied for judicial review , submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest his religion or belief which was protected by Article 9 ( 1 ) of the European Convention on Human Rights . The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant 's right was justified as it was necessary for the protection of public morals and of the rights and freedoms of others . The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9 , holding that open air pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation . = = = Test for determining if restriction of right is appropriate = = = = = = = Singapore = = = = In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. ( 1994 ) , counsel for the appellants argued that there had to be a \" clear and immediate danger \" to public order before the right of freedom of religion could be restricted , and in this case the restriction was unjustified since there had been no such threat at all . However , Yong C.J. said that attempt to apply the \" clear and immediate danger \" test was misplaced : It cannot be said that beliefs , especially those propagated in the name of \" religion \" , should not be put to a stop until such a scenario exists . If not , it would in all probability be too late as the damage sought to be prevented would have transpired . However , Yong C.J. did not articulate any alternative test for determining if a restriction upon freedom of religion is appropriate . Quoting Malaysian Chief Justice Hashim Yeop Sani 's judgment in the case Minister for Home Affairs , Malaysia v. Jamaluddin bin Othman ( 1989 ) , he agreed that \" [ t ] he freedom to profess and practise one 's religion should not be turned into a licence to commit unlawful acts or acts tending to prejudice or threaten the security of the country \" . Yong C.J. considered that since \" the sovereignty , integrity and unity of Singapore are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the Constitution \" , religious beliefs and practices which tended to run counter to these objectives had to be restrained . In the appeal against Prakash J. ' s judgment to the Court of Appeal , also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts ( 1996 ) , counsel for the appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation , sale and distribution of the Jehovah 's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate . Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. ( 1994 ) , the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah 's Witnesses ' refusal to carry out National Service was a threat to national security . The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring an application for judicial review of Order No. 405 / 1995 . Professor Thio Li-ann has argued that since Article 15 ( 1 ) is the general statement of principle that guarantees freedom of religion while Article 15 ( 4 ) is an exception to the general principle , Yong C.J. ' s assertion that \" actions undertaken or flowing from [ religious ] beliefs must conform with the general law relating to public order and social protection \" is incorrect . In making a case against judicial deference and for judicial balancing of interests , she says : It is the judicial role to devise constitutional tests like a [ n ] Object of Act \u2013 Art 15 ( 4 ) nexus test or to ensure that a sufficient relationship exists between the means and end of the Act , with the end conforming to an Art 15 ( 4 ) ground . Any other interpretation runs the risk of the exception swallowing up the general , which would make a mockery of any constitutional liberty . In Thio 's view , courts should adopt a three-step proportionality approach when interpreting constitutional fundamental liberties . A judge should first \" identify the interests behind two competing rights eg the value of religious liberty as a source of private and public virtue as well as being an aspect of free conscience as against the value of having public order and a stable environment . Secondly , these factors are all to be placed on the Libra-like balancing scales of justice so that their merits and demerits can be assessed against each other . ... Thirdly , all things considered , the Judge is to deliver his judgment as to where the balance should lie . \" In the light of this approach , Yong C.J. ' s acceptance of the Minister 's view \" as conclusive , refusing to question it on the basis of not wanting to transgress the legal / merits dichotomy \" resulted in a failure to balance the interest of the appellants against that of the State . = = = = Other jurisdictions = = = = The situation in Singapore may be contrasted with the application of a proportionality analysis in other jurisdictions vis-\u00e0-vis the constitutional protection of freedom of religion . Section 2 ( a ) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that the freedom of conscience and religion is a fundamental freedom enjoyed by everybody . It is subject to section 1 : \" The rights and freedoms set out in the Canadian Charter are subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society . \" In the important decision R. v. Oakes ( 1986 ) , the Supreme Court of Canada held that a two-part test must be satisfied before a limitation infringing a right can be \" saved \" by section 1 . First , the limitation must have \" an objective related to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society \" ; and , second , it must be shown \" that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified \" . The second part is described as a \" proportionality test \" which requires the invoking party to show : First , the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question . They must not be arbitrary , unfair or based on irrational considerations . In short , they must be rationally connected to the objective . Second , the means , even if rationally connected to the objective in this first sense , should impair \" as little as possible \" the right or freedom in question . Third , there must be a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom , and the objective which has been identified as of \" sufficient importance \" . In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys ( Commission scolaire ) ( 2006 ) , the issue was whether a ban in a public school on Sikh students carrying kirpans ( ceremonial daggers ) for religious purposes was justifiable . Justice Louise Charron , who delivered the Court 's majority opinion , applied the Oakes test to section 2 ( a ) of the Charter . She held that the school could not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student 's constitutional freedom of religion . The UK Human Rights Act 1998 makes Article 9 ( 1 ) of the European Convention on Human Rights , which protects freedom of religion , enforceable in UK domestic law . Article 9 ( 2 ) states when the freedom of religion may be restricted : \" Freedom to manifest one 's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety , for the protection of public order , health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . \" R. ( Begum ) v. Headteacher and Governors of Denbigh High School ( 2006 ) was a House of Lords case involving a female Muslim student who wished to wear a jilbab ( a long , coat-like garment ) to comply with her understanding of the requirements of her faith , but was disallowed from doing so . Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that under Article 9 ( 2 ) , for a restriction to be justified it must be \" prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society for a permissible purpose , that is , it must be directed to a legitimate purpose and must be proportionate in scope and effect \" . In the end , a majority of the Law Lords hearing the appeal ( including Lord Bingham ) held that the appellant 's rights had not been interfered with . However , the court held unanimously that even if they had been , there were justifiable grounds for such interference , one of which was the need to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of Muslim dress . In Prince v. President of the Law Society of the Cape of Good Hope ( 2002 ) , the appellant challenged , among other things , the constitutionality of the South African Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act 1992 before the Constitutional Court of South Africa . He claimed that his religion \u2013 the Rastafari movement \u2013 required him to use cannabis and argued that the Act , which prohibited the possession of this drug , infringed his right to freedom of religion protected by section 15 of Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South Africa . Similar to section 1 of the Canadian Charter , section 36 ( 1 ) of the South African Constitution provides : The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of law of general application to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity , equality and freedom , taking into account all relevant factors , including the nature of the right ; the importance of the purpose of the limitation ; and extent of the limitation ; the relation between the limitation and its purpose ; and less restrictive means to achieve the purpose . Justice Sandile Ngcobo , writing for the minority , said that \" [ t ] he limitation analysis ... involves the weighing up of competing values and ultimately an assessment based on proportionality \" , and that in weighing competing interests and evaluating proportionality it was \" necessary to examine the relation between the complete ban on the sacramental use or possession of cannabis by the Rastafari and the purpose of the limitation as well as the existence of the less restrictive means to achieve this purpose \" . Ultimately , though , a majority of the Court held that although the appellant 's freedom of religion had been infringed , the infringement was justifiable in that the restriction was proportionate to the \" war on drugs \" policy of the State \u2013 a general exemption for religious purposes would be virtually impossible to police and would interfere materially with the government 's ability to enforce its drug control legislation , and other proposed control schemes would be administratively unworkable . A key distinction between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution is that in the latter document , the grounds set out in Article 15 ( 4 ) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society . One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15 ( 4 ) . = = = Burden of proof = = = An applicant has the burden of proving that a legislative restriction on the freedom of speech has nothing to do with public order , public health or morality . There must be some substance in the applicant 's complaint \u2013 the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant 's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15 ( 1 ) . = = = Instances of restrictions = = = = = = = Right of propagation = = = = Propagation of religion is not protected when it amounts to an act contrary to any general law relating to public order , public health , or morality under Article 15 ( 4 ) of the Constitution . In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin ( 2005 ) , a District Court held that the right to propagate an opinion is not an unfettered right : The right of one person 's freedom of expression must always be balanced by the right of another 's freedom from offence , and tempered by wider public interest considerations . It is only appropriate social behaviour , independent of any legal duty , of every Singapore citizen and resident to respect the other races in view of our multi-racial society . Each individual living here irrespective of his racial origin owes it to himself and to the country to see that nothing is said or done which might incite the people and plunge the country into racial strife and violence . These are basic ground rules . In Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong ( 2009 ) , the District Court said that the above statement , which referred to opinions on race , applied with equal force to insensitive and denigrating opinions about religious beliefs . The case involved two accused persons who were convicted under the Sedition Act and the Undesirable Publications Act for distributing religious literature that was considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims . Section 3 ( 1 ) ( e ) of the Sedition Act defines a seditious tendency as including a tendency to \" promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore \" . In the course of spreading their own faith , the accused persons had offended public order by distributing religious materials that were objectionable to Muslims , and the Court regarded this to be beyond the bounds of the constitutional right to propagate religion . The Court was of the view that although a person is free to choose his or her own religion and to practise it , religious fervour to spread faith must be constrained by considerations of sensitivity , tolerance and mutual respect for the faith and religious beliefs of another . Individuals cannot claim to be ignorant of the sensitivity of race and religion in Singapore 's multi-racial and multi-religious society . Larissis v. Greece ( 1999 ) points to other grounds on which the right to propagate one 's religion might reasonably be restricted in Singapore . In that case , the European Court of Human Rights accepted that the right to try to persuade another of one 's own religious beliefs is included in the \" right to manifest [ one 's ] religion or belief \" provided for by Article 9 ( 1 ) of the European Convention on Human Rights . However , this right is not void of limitations . Article 9 ( 2 ) of the Convention prescribes limitations to the freedom to manifest one 's religion \" in the interests of public safety , for the protection of public order , health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others \" . The Court clarified that Article 9 ( 1 ) does not protect improper proselytism , such as when one offers material or social advantages to entice another to adopt certain religious beliefs , or when one applies improper pressure with a view to gaining new members for a religious group . On the facts of the case , the Court found that Article 9 had not been infringed by the prosecution of three air force officers for proselytizing to their subordinates , since the hierarchical nature of military life meant it was difficult for a subordinate to rebuff the approaches of persons of superior rank . Thus , a conversation which might be regarded as a harmless exchange of ideas in a civilian context could be seen in a military setting as harassment or the imposition of undue pressure in abuse of power . = = Other constitutional provisions = = In addition to Article 15 , there are other provisions in the Constitution that protect religious freedom . Article 12 ( 2 ) prohibits discrimination against Singapore citizens on the ground of , among others , religion in any law ; in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority ; or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition , holding or disposition of property , or the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . Related to this is Article 16 , subsection ( 1 ) of which prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of , among others , religion in the administration of public educational institutions ( and , in particular , as regards the admission of students or the payment of fees ) , and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution . The Constitution declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions , but provides that people cannot be discriminated against on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws . Furthermore , no person may be compelled to receive instruction in or take part in any ceremony or act of worship of a religion apart from his or her own . The Government has a constitutional responsibility \" constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore \" . In particular , the Government must exercise its functions in such a way as to recognize the special position of the Malays , the indigenous people of Singapore . Accordingly , it has the responsibility to \" protect , safeguard , support , foster and promote their political , educational , religious , economic , social and cultural interests and the Malay language . \" The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate Muslim religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the President concerning matters relating to Islam . The legislation in question is the Administration of Muslim Law Act . = = = Cases = = = Re Mohamed Said Nabi , deceased [ 1965 ] M.L.J. [ Malayan Law Journal ] 121 , High Court ( Singapore ) .

                "Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution = The Fourth Amendment ( Amendment IV ) to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and requires any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause . It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance , a type of general search warrant issued by the British government and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America . The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison , along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights , in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution . Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28 , 1789 . By December 15 , 1791 , the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it . On March 1 , 1792 , Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment . Because the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to the states , and federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation 's history , there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century . The amendment was held to apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) . Under the Fourth Amendment , search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court , usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions : what government activities constitute \" search \" and \" seizure \" ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . Early court decisions limited the amendment 's scope to a law enforcement officer 's physical intrusion onto private property , but with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) , the Supreme Court held that its protections , such as the warrant requirement , extend to the privacy of individuals as well as physical locations . Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most search and seizure activities , but the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches , motor vehicle searches , evidence in plain view , exigent circumstances , border searches , and other situations . The exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced . Established in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) , this rule holds that evidence obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible at criminal trials . Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal search may also be inadmissible as \" fruit of the poisonous tree , \" unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means . = = Text = = The amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows : The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . = = Background = = = = = English law = = = Like many other areas of American law , the Fourth Amendment finds its roots in English legal doctrine . Sir Edward Coke , in Semayne 's case ( 1604 ) , famously stated : \" The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress , as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose . \" Semayne 's Case acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects ' dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained . The 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state officers , who , using general warrants , conducted raids in search of materials relating to John Wilkes 's publications attacking both government policies and the King himself . The most famous of these cases involved John Entick , whose home was forcibly entered by the King 's Messenger Nathan Carrington , along with others , pursuant to a warrant issued by George Montagu-Dunk , 2nd Earl of Halifax authorizing them \" to make strict and diligent search for ... the author , or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers entitled , ' The Monitor or British Freeholder , No 257 , 357 , 358 , 360 , 373 , 376 , 378 , and 380 , ' \" and seized printed charts , pamphlets and other materials . Entick filed suit in Entick v Carrington , argued before the Court of King 's Bench in 1765 . Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden ruled that both the search and the seizure was unlawful , as the warrant authorized the seizure of all of Entick 's papers \u2014 not just the criminal ones \u2014 and as the warrant lacked probable cause to even justify the search . By holding that \" [ O ] ur law holds the property of every man so sacred , that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour 's close without his leave \" , Entick established the English precedent that the executive is limited in intruding on private property by common law . = = = Colonial America = = = Homes in Colonial America , on the other hand , did not enjoy the same sanctity as their British counterparts , because legislation had been explicitly written so as to enable enforcement of British revenue-gathering policies on customs ; until 1750 , in fact , the only type of warrant defined in the handbooks for justices of the peace was the general warrant . During what scholar William Cuddihy called the \" colonial epidemic of general searches \" , the authorities possessed almost unlimited power to search for anything at any time , with very little oversight . In 1756 , the colony of Massachusetts enacted legislation that barred the use of general warrants . This represented the first law in American history curtailing the use of seizure power . Its creation largely stemmed from the great public outcry over the Excise Act of 1754 , which gave tax collectors unlimited powers to interrogate colonists concerning their use of goods subject to customs . The act also permitted the use of a general warrant known as a writ of assistance , allowing tax collectors to search the homes of colonists and seize \" prohibited and uncustomed \" goods . A crisis erupted over the writs of assistance on December 27 , 1760 when the news of King George II 's death on October 23 arrived in Boston . All writs automatically expired six months after the death of the King and would have had to be re-issued by George III , the new king , to remain valid . In mid-January 1761 , a group of over 50 merchants represented by James Otis petitioned the court to have hearings on the issue . During the five-hour hearing on February 23 , 1761 , Otis vehemently denounced British colonial policies , including their sanction of general warrants and writs of assistance . However , the court ruled against Otis . Future US President John Adams , who was present in the courtroom when Otis spoke , viewed these events as \" the spark in which originated the American Revolution . \" Because of the name he had made for himself in attacking the writs , Otis was elected to the Massachusetts colonial legislature and helped pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be \" granted by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any officer of the customs \" and barring all other writs . The governor overturned the legislation , finding it contrary to English law and parliamentary sovereignty . Seeing the danger general warrants presented , the Virginia Declaration of Rights ( 1776 ) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants . This prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment : That general warrants , whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed , or to seize any person or persons not named , or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence , are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted . Article XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights , written by John Adams and enacted in 1780 as part of the Massachusetts Constitution , added the requirement that all searches must be \" reasonable \" and served as another basis for the language of the Fourth Amendment : Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches , and seizures of his person , his houses , his papers , and all his possessions . All warrants , therefore , are contrary to this right , if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation ; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer , to make search in suspected places , or to arrest one or more suspected persons , or to seize their property , be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search , arrest , or seizure : and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases , and with the formalities , prescribed by the laws . By 1784 , eight state constitutions contained a provision against general warrants . = = Proposal and ratification = = After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation , a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17 , 1787 , featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes . George Mason , a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia 's Declaration of Rights , proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included . Other delegates \u2014 including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison \u2014 disagreed , arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other , unnamed rights were unprotected . After a brief debate , Mason 's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations . For the constitution to be ratified , however , nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions . Opposition to ratification ( \" Anti-Federalism \" ) was partly based on the Constitution 's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties . Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification ( including Virginia , Massachusetts , and New York ) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights . Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches . In the 1st United States Congress , following the state legislatures ' request , James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689 , including an amendment requiring probable cause for government searches . Congress reduced Madison 's proposed twenty amendments to twelve , and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25 , 1789 . By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification , opinions had shifted in both parties . Many Federalists , who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights , now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists ' most effective criticism . Many Anti-Federalists , in contrast , now opposed it , realizing that the Bill 's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention , which they desired . Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution , such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation , intact . On November 20 , 1789 , New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments , including the Fourth . On December 19 , 1789 , December 22 , 1789 , and January 19 , 1790 , respectively , Maryland , North Carolina , and South Carolina ratified all twelve amendments . On January 25 and 28 , 1790 , respectively , New Hampshire and Delaware ratified eleven of the Bill 's twelve amendments , including the Fourth . This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten , but the process stalled in other states : Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify , while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments , but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so . ( All three states would later ratify the Bill of Rights for sesquicentennial celebrations in 1939 . ) In February through June of 1790 , New York , Pennsylvania , and Rhode Island each ratified eleven of the amendments , including the Fourth . Virginia initially postponed its debate , but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791 , the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven . Vermont ratified on November 3 , 1791 , approving all twelve amendments , and Virginia finally followed on December 15 , 1791 . Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1 , 1792 . = = Applicability = = The Bill of Rights originally only restricted the federal government , and went through a long initial phase of \" judicial dormancy \" ; in the words of historian Gordon S. Wood , \" After ratification , most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution . \" Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act were passed . As federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as narcotics , more questions about the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court . The U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing \" the privacy , dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government , without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function . \" In Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues : what government activities constitute \" search \" and \" seizure \" ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . The Fourth Amendment typically requires \" a neutral and detached authority interposed between the police and the public , \" and it is offended by \" general warrants \" and laws that allows searches to be conducted \" indiscriminately and without regard to their connection with [ a ] crime under investigation . \" , for the \" basic purpose of the Fourth Amendment , which is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth , through its prohibition of \" unreasonable \" searches and seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials . \" The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant , because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and \" searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable . \" In order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable , it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person ( usually a law enforcement officer ) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court . The Supreme Court further held in Chandler v. Miller ( 1997 ) : \" To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment , a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . But particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on ' special needs , beyond the normal need for law enforcement . ' ... When such ' special needs ' are alleged , courts must undertake a context-specific inquiry , examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties . \" The amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures , but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government . In Ontario v. Quon ( 2010 ) , the Court held the amendment to also apply to the government when acting as an employer , ruling that a government could search a police officer 's text messages that were sent over that government 's pager . = = = Search = = = One threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a \" search \" has occurred . Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on a citizen 's property rights \u2014 that is , when the government physically intrudes on \" persons , houses , papers , or effects \" for the purpose of obtaining information , a \" search \" within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred . Early 20th-century Court decisions , such as Olmstead v. United States ( 1928 ) , held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of physical intrusion , but not to other forms of police surveillance ( e.g. , wiretaps ) . In Silverman v. United States ( 1961 ) , the Court stated of the amendment that \" at the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion . \" Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) . In Katz , the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual 's right to privacy , and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass . While there was no physical intrusion into the booth , the Court reasoned that : 1 ) Katz , by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him , had exhibited his expectation that \" the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world \" ; and 2 ) society believes that his expectation was reasonable . Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that \" the Fourth Amendment protects people , not places \" . A \" search \" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person 's \" reasonable expectation of privacy . \" Katz 's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government 's intrusion , though electronic rather than physical , was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment , and thus necessitated a warrant . The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment , and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed . This decision in Katz was later developed into the now commonly used two-prong test , adopted in Smith v. Maryland ( 1979 ) , for determining whether the Fourth Amendment is applicable in a given circumstance : a person \" has exhibited an actual ( subjective ) expectation of privacy \" ; and society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is ( objectively ) reasonable . The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties . In Smith , the Court held individuals have no \" legitimate expectation of privacy \" regarding the telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that information to telephone companies when they dial a number . Following Katz , the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy , but in United States v. Jones ( 2012 ) , the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law , but rather , has supplemented it . In Jones , law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car 's exterior without Jones ' knowledge or consent . The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car , and so had a property interest in the car . Therefore , since the intrusion on the vehicle \u2014 a common law trespass \u2014 was for the purpose of obtaining information , the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment . The Court used similar \" trespass \" reasoning in Florida v. Jardines ( 2013 ) , to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search . In certain situations , law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity , even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest . Under Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) , law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances . In Terry , the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses \" unusual conduct \" that leads that officer to reasonably believe \" that criminal activity may be afoot \" , that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others , the officer may conduct a \" pat-down search \" ( or \" frisk \" ) to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon . This detention and search is known as a Terry stop . To conduct a frisk , officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which , taken together with rational inferences from those facts , reasonably warrant their actions . As established in Florida v. Royer ( 1983 ) , such a search must be temporary , and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop ( e.g. , officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car , cannot , after confirming that it is not stolen , compel the person to answer questions about anything else , such as the possession of contraband ) . = = = Seizure = = = The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person , person 's home ( including its curtilage ) or personal property without a warrant . A seizure of property occurs when there is \" some meaningful interference with an individual 's possessory interests in that property \" , such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence , or when they participate in an eviction . The amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure of persons , including a brief detention . A seizure does not occur just because the government questions an individual in a public place . The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained . The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable , objective grounds , with few exceptions . His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds . In United States v. Mendenhall ( 1980 ) , the Court held that a person is seized only when , by means of physical force or show of authority , his freedom of movement is restrained and , in the circumstances surrounding the incident , a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave . In Florida v. Bostick ( 1991 ) , the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required , the police contact is a \" citizen encounter \" that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment . If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government , there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person 's privacy under the Fourth Amendment . When a person is arrested and taken into police custody , he has been seized ( i.e. , a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car would not think they were free to leave ) . A person subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand , has been seized , but is not \" arrested \" because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal arrest . If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior , a law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity , provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case . A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment , so long as the arresting officer has probable cause . In Maryland v. King ( 2013 ) , the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes , along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain . = = = = Exceptions = = = = The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion , with a few exceptions . In Delaware v. Prouse ( 1979 ) , the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver 's license and the registration of the automobile , unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered , or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law . Where society 's need is great , no other effective means of meeting the need is available , and intrusion on people 's privacy is minimal , certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists . In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints . In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz ( 1990 ) , the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints . In Illinois v. Lidster ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints . However , in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond ( 2000 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed . = = = Warrant = = = Under the Fourth Amendment , law enforcement must receive written permission from a court of law , or otherwise qualified magistrate , to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity . A court grants permission by issuing a writ known as a warrant . A search or seizure is generally unreasonable and unconstitutional if conducted without a valid warrant and the police must obtain a warrant whenever practicable . Searches and seizures without a warrant are not considered unreasonable if one of the specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement applies . These exceptions apply \" [ o ] nly in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs , beyond the normal need for law enforcement , make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable . \" In these situations where the warrant requirement doesn 't apply a search or seizure nonetheless must be justified by some individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . However , the U.S. Supreme Court carved out an exception to the requirement of individualized suspicion . It ruled that , \" In limited circumstances , where the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion \" a search [ or seizure ] would still be reasonable . = = = Probable cause = = = The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search . The government has a probable cause to make an arrest when \" the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information \" would lead a prudent person to believe that the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime . Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made . Evidence obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the arrest . When police conduct a search , the amendment requires that the warrant establish probable cause to believe that the search will uncover criminal activity or contraband . They must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary . In Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) , the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible , common-sense standard . To that end , the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States ( 1925 ) that the term probable cause means \" less than evidence that would justify condemnation \" , reiterating Carroll 's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \" warrant a man of reasonable caution \" in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime . It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false . A \" practical , non-technical \" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required . In Illinois v. Gates ( 1983 ) , the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the \" totality of the circumstances . \" = = Exceptions to the warrant requirement = = = = = Consent = = = If a party gives consent to a search , a warrant is not required . There are exceptions and complications to the rule , including the scope of the consent given , whether the consent is voluntarily given , and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another 's property . In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte ( 1973 ) , the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search . This contrasts with Fifth Amendment rights , which cannot be relinquished without an explicit Miranda warning from police . The Court stated in United States v. Matlock ( 1974 ) that a third party co-occupant could give consent for a search without violating a suspect 's Fourth Amendment rights . Per the Court 's ruling in Illinois v. Rodriguez ( 1990 ) , a consent search is still considered valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an \" apparent authority \" , even if that party is later discovered to not have authority over the property in question . = = = Plain view and open fields = = = According to the plain view doctrine as defined in Coolidge v. New Hampshire ( 1971 ) , if an officer is lawfully present , he may seize objects that are in \" plain view \" . However , the officer must have had probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband . Similarly , \" open fields \" such as pastures , open water , and woods may be searched without a warrant , on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy . The doctrine was first articulated by the Court in Hester v. United States ( 1924 ) , which stated that \" the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their ' persons , houses , papers , and effects , ' is not extended to the open fields . \" In Oliver v. United States ( 1984 ) , the police ignored a \" no trespassing \" sign and a fence , trespassed onto the suspect 's land without a warrant , followed a path for hundreds of feet , and discovered a field of marijuana . The Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken place , because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open field : open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance . There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities , such as the cultivation of crops , that occur in open fields . While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment , the curtilage , or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home , is protected . Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person 's home ( unlike a person 's open fields ) under the Fourth Amendment . The curtilage is \" intimately linked to the home , both physically and psychologically , \" and is where \" privacy expectations are most heightened . \" However , courts have held aerial surveillance of curtilage not to be included in the protections from unwarranted search so long as the airspace above the curtilage is generally accessible by the public . An area is curtilage if it \" harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man 's home and the privacies of life . \" Courts make this determination by examining \" whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home , the nature of the uses to which the area is put , and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by . \" The Court has acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is typically treated as an invitation , or license , to the public to approach the front door of the home to deliver mail , sell goods , solicit for charities , etc . This license extends to the police , who have the right to try engaging a home 's occupant in a \" knock and talk \" for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant . However , they cannot bring a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home without either a warrant or consent of the homeowner or resident . = = = Exigent circumstance = = = Law enforcement officers may also conduct warrantless searches in several types of exigent circumstances where obtaining a warrant is dangerous or impractical . One example is the Terry stop , which allows police to frisk suspects for weapons . The Court also allowed a search of arrested persons in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) to preserve evidence that might otherwise be destroyed and to ensure suspects were disarmed . In Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) , the Court ruled that law enforcement officers could search a vehicle that they suspected of carrying contraband without a warrant . The Court allowed blood to be drawn without a warrant from drunk-driving suspects in Schmerber v. California ( 1966 ) on the grounds that the time to obtain a warrant would allow a suspect 's blood alcohol content to reduce , although this was later modified by Missouri v. McNeely ( 2013 ) . Warden v. Hayden ( 1967 ) provided an exception to the warrant requirement if officers were in \" hot pursuit \" of a suspect . = = = Motor vehicle = = = The Supreme Court has held that individuals in automobiles have a reduced expectation of privacy , because vehicles generally do not serve as residences or repositories of personal effects . Vehicles may not be randomly stopped and searched ; there must be probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity . Items in plain view may be seized ; areas that could potentially hide weapons may also be searched . With probable cause to believe evidence is present , police officers may search any area in the vehicle . However , they may not extend the search to the vehicle 's passengers without probable cause to search those passengers or consent from the passengers . In Arizona v. Gant ( 2009 ) , the Court ruled that a law enforcement officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an arrest of an occupant of that vehicle , unless 1 ) at the time of the search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2 ) police officers have reason to believe that evidence for the crime for which the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle . = = = Searches incident to a lawful arrest = = = A common law rule from Great Britain permits searches incident to an arrest without a warrant . This rule has been applied in American law , and has a lengthy common law history . The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1 . ) from destroying evidence or 2 . ) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \" both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply \" , when \" there is no possibility \" that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence . In Trupiano v. United States ( 1948 ) , the Supreme Court held that \" a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been considered to be a strictly limited right . It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest . But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest . \" In United States v. Rabinowitz ( 1950 ) , the Court reversed Trupiano , holding instead that the officers ' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest . Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the \" immediate control \" of the arrestee could be searched , but it did not define the term . In deciding Chimel v. California ( 1969 ) , the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions . It held that when an arrest is made , it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence . However , in Riley v. California ( 2014 ) , the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee 's cellular phone . The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to \" modern cellphones , which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy , \" and noted that US citizens ' cellphones today typically contain \" a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives \u2014 from the mundane to the intimate . \" = = = Border search exception = = = Searches conducted at the United States border or the equivalent of the border ( such as an international airport ) may be conducted without a warrant or probable cause subject to the border search exception . Most border searches may be conducted entirely at random , without any level of suspicion , pursuant to U.S. Customs and Border Protection plenary search authority . However , searches that intrude upon a traveler 's personal dignity and privacy interests , such as strip and body cavity searches , must be supported by \" reasonable suspicion . \" The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth circuits have ruled that information on a traveler 's electronic materials , including personal files on a laptop computer , may be searched at random , without suspicion . = = = Foreign intelligence surveillance = = = The Supreme Court decision in United States v. U.S. District Court ( 1972 ) left open the possibility for a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause . Three United States Courts of Appeals have recognized a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause , but tied it to certain requirements . The exception to the Fourth Amendment was formally recognized by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review in its 2008 In re Directives decision . The lower court held that , \" a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment 's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be located outside the United States . \" Despite the foregoing citation the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures nonetheless apply to the contents of all communications , whatever the means , because , \" a person 's private communications are akin to personal papers . \" To protect the telecommunication carriers cooperating with the US government from legal action , the Congress passed a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit this type of surveillance . = = = Other exceptions = = = In New Jersey v. T. L. O. ( 1985 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that searches in public schools do not require warrants , as long as the searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity . However , in Safford Unified School District v. Redding ( 2009 ) , the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student . Similarly , in Samson v. California ( 2006 ) , the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds . Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause . = = Exclusionary rule = = One way courts enforce the Fourth Amendment is through the use of the exclusionary rule . The rule provides that evidence obtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally not admissible by the prosecution during the defendant 's criminal trial . The Court stated in Elkins v. United States ( 1960 ) that the rule 's function \" is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it . \" The Court adopted the exclusionary rule in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) , prior to which all evidence , no matter how seized , could be admitted in court . In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States ( 1920 ) and Nardone v. United States ( 1939 ) , the Court ruled that leads or other evidence resulting from illegally obtained evidence are also inadmissible in trials . Justice Felix Frankfurter described this secondary evidence in the Nardone decision as the \" fruit of the poisonous tree \" . The Supreme Court rejected incorporating the exclusionary rule by way of the Fourteenth Amendment in Wolf v. Colorado ( 1949 ) , but Wolf was explicitly overruled in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) , making the Fourth Amendment ( including the exclusionary rule ) applicable in state proceedings . The exclusionary rule and its effectiveness have often been controversial , particularly since its 1961 application to state proceedings . Critics charge that the rule hampers police investigation and can result in freeing guilty parties convicted on reliable evidence ; other critics state that the rule has not been successful in deterring illegal police searches . Proponents argue that the number of criminal convictions overturned under the rule has been minimal and that no other effective mechanism exists to enforce the Fourth Amendment . In 1982 , California passed a \" Victim 's Bill of Rights \" containing a provision to repeal the exclusionary rule ; though the bill could not affect federally mandated rights under the Fourth Amendment , it blocked the state courts from expanding these protections further . = = = Limitations = = = Starting with United States v. Calandra ( 1974 ) , the Supreme Court has repeatedly limited the exclusionary rule . The Court in Calandra ruled that grand juries may use illegally obtained evidence when questioning witnesses , because \" the damage to that institution from the unprecedented extension of the exclusionary rule outweighs the benefit of any possible incremental deterrent effect . \" Explaining the purpose of the rule , the Court said that the rule \" is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect , rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved . \" Several cases in 1984 further restricted the exclusionary rule : In United States v. Leon , the Court established the \" good faith \" exception to the rule , ruling that evidence seized by officers reasonably relying on a warrant was still admissible , even though the warrant was later found to be defective , unless an officer dishonestly or recklessly prepared an affidavit to seek a warrant , the issuing magistrate abandoned his neutrality , or the warrant lacked sufficient particularity . The Court determined in Nix v. Williams that \" fruit of the poisonous tree \" evidence could still be introduced if a prosecutor could demonstrate that it would have been an \" inevitable discovery \" of legitimate investigation . In Segura v. United States , the Court ruled that evidence illegally found without a search warrant is admissible if the evidence is later found and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal search . In Arizona v. Evans ( 1995 ) and Herring v. United States ( 2009 ) , the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence found due to negligence regarding a government database , as long as the arresting police officer relied on that database in \" good faith \" and the negligence was not pervasive . In Davis v. United States ( 2011 ) , the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to a Fourth Amendment violation resulting from a reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent . In Utah v. Strieff ( 2016 ) , the Court ruled that evidence obtained from an unlawful police stop would not be excluded from court when the link between the stop and the evidence \u2019 s discovery was \u201c attenuated \u201d by the discovery of an outstanding warrant during the stop . The Supreme Court has also held the exclusionary rule to not apply in the following circumstances : evidence illegally seized by a \" private actor \" ( i.e. , not a governmental employee ) tax hearings evidence collected by U.S. Customs agents deportation hearings evidence seized by probation or parole officers probation or parole revocation hearings",
                "Kantian ethics = Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant . The theory , developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism , is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim \u2013 the principle behind it \u2013 is duty to the moral law . Central to Kant 's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative , which acts on all people , regardless of their interests or desires . Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways . His principle of universalisability requires that , for an action to be permissible , it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring . His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end , but always also as ends in themselves . The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will , while Kant 's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom . Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties . A perfect duty , such as the duty not to lie , always holds true ; an imperfect duty , such as the duty to give to charity , can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place . American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism , political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau , the modern debate between rationalism and empiricism , and the influence of natural law as influences on the development of Kant 's ethics . Other philosophers have argued that Kant 's parents and his teacher , Martin Knutzen , influenced his ethics . Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas , political philosopher John Rawls , and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan . German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature . German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive . Michael Stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship , while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations . The Catholic Church has criticised Kant 's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics . The claim that all humans are due dignity and respect as autonomous agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed upon anyone , and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society . Kant 's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely as a means to an end , leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices . Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they do not treat women as ends . Kant also believed that , because animals do not possess rationality , we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them . Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics : because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth , we must never lie , even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth . = = Outline = = Although all of Kant 's work develops his ethical theory , it is most clearly defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals , Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals . As part of the Enlightenment tradition , Kant based his ethical theory on the belief that reason should be used to determine how people ought to act . He did not attempt to prescribe specific action , but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave . = = = Good will and duty = = = In his combined works , Kant constructed the basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty . Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will . No other virtue has this status because every other virtue can be used to achieve immoral ends ( the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person , for example ) . The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions . Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends . For Kant a good will is a broader conception than a will which acts from duty . A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances in order to keep the moral law . A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions . Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth . This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless ( these still deserve approval and encouragement ) , but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty . Kant 's conception of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly . Although duty often constrains people and prompts them to act against their inclinations , it still comes from an agent 's volition : they desire to keep the moral law . Thus , when an agent performs an action from duty it is because the rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations . Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy , when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them . = = = = Perfect and imperfect duties = = = = Applying the categorical imperative , duties arise because failure to fulfil them would either result in a contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will . The former are classified as perfect duties , the latter as imperfect . A perfect duty always holds true \u2014 there is a perfect duty to tell the truth , so we must never lie . An imperfect duty allows flexibility \u2014 beneficence is an imperfect duty because we are not obliged to be completely beneficent at all times , but may choose the times and places in which we are . Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties : if a conflict between duties arises , the perfect duty must be followed . = = = Categorical Imperative = = = Main Article : Categorical Imperative The primary formulation of Kant 's ethics is the categorical imperative , from which he derived four further formulations . Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives . A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey if we want to satisfy our desires : ' go to the doctor ' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well . A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires : everyone has a duty to not lie , regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so . These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason , rather than contingent facts about an agent . Unlike hypothetical imperatives , which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to , we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents . We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents ; therefore , rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times . = = = = Universalizability = = = = Kant 's first formulation of the Categorical Imperative is that of universalizability : Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . When someone acts , it is according to a rule , or maxim . For Kant , an act is only permissible if one is willing for the maxim that allows the action to be a universal law by which everyone acts . Maxims fail this test if they produce either a contradiction in conception or a contradiction in the will when universalized . A contradiction in conception happens when , if a maxim were to be universalized , it ceases to make sense because the \" ... maxim would necessarily destroy itself as soon as it was made a universal law . \" For example , if the maxim ' It is permissible to break promises ' was universalized , no one would trust any promises made , so the idea of a promise would become meaningless ; the maxim would be self-contradictory because , when universalized , promises cease to be meaningful . The maxim is not moral because it is logically impossible to universalize \u2014 we could not conceive of a world where this maxim was universalized . A maxim can also be immoral if it creates a contradiction in the will when universalized . This does not mean a logical contradiction , but that universalizing the maxim leads to a state of affairs that no rational being would desire . For example , Driver argues that the maxim ' I will not give to charity ' produces a contradiction in the will when universalized because a world where no one gives to charity would be undesirable for the person who acts by that maxim . Kant believed that morality is the objective law of reason : just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions ( apples fall down because of gravity , for example ) , objective rational laws necessitate rational actions . He thus believed that a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary to do what is rationally necessary . Because humans are not perfectly rational ( they partly act by instinct ) , Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws , which he called conformity obligation . Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori , existing externally from rational being . Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings , rational laws ( morality ) exist prior to rational beings . Therefore , according to Kant , rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance . = = = = Humanity as an end in itself = = = = Kant 's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative is to treat humanity as an end in itself : Act in such a way that you treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of another , always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means . Kant argued that rational beings can never be treated merely as means to ends ; they must always also be treated as ends themselves , requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected . This derives from Kant 's claim that reason motivates morality : it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings , including other people . A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely as a means to an end , so they must always be treated as an end . Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity : that which is rationally willed is morally right . Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means , it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such . This does not mean that we can never treat a human as a means to an end , but that when we do , we also treat him as an end in himself . = = = = Formula of autonomy = = = = Kant 's Formula of Autonomy expresses the idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their rational will , rather than any outside influence . Kant believed that any moral law motivated by the desire to fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative , leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will . This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that , as moral laws must be universalisable , what is required of one person is required of all . = = = = Kingdom of Ends = = = = Another formulation of Kant 's Categorical Imperative is the Kingdom of Ends : A rational being must always regard himself as giving laws either as member or as sovereign in a kingdom of ends which is rendered possible by the freedom of will . This formulation requires that actions be considered as if their maxim is to provide a law for a hypothetical Kingdom of Ends . Accordingly , people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would accept as laws . In such a community , each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every member of the community without treating any member merely as a means to an end . Although the Kingdom of Ends is an ideal \u2014 the actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions with good intentions sometimes result in harm \u2014 we are still required to act categorically , as legislators of this ideal kingdom . = = Influences on Kantian ethics = = Philosopher Louis Pojman has suggested four strong influences on Kant 's ethics . The first is the Lutheran sect Pietism , to which Kant 's parents subscribed . Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief , more concerned with feeling than rationality . Kant believed that rationality is required , but that it should be concerned with morality and good will . Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau , whose work , The Social Contract , influenced Kant 's view on the fundamental worth of human beings . Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant 's ethics . Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism , which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge , rather than something based on human desire . Natural law ( the belief that the moral law is determined by nature ) and intuitionism ( the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths ) were , according to Pojman , also influential for Kant . Biographer of Kant , Manfred Kuhn , suggested that the values Kant 's parents held , of \" hard work , honesty , cleanliness , and independence \u201d , set him an example and influenced him more than their Pietism did . In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , Michael Rohlf suggests that Kant was influenced by his teacher , Martin Knutzen , himself influenced by the work of Christian Wolff and John Locke , and who introduced Kant to the work of English physicist Isaac Newton . = = Significance of Kantian ethics = = = = = Influenced by Kantian ethics = = = = = = = J\u00fcrgen Habermas = = = = German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas has proposed a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics . He proposes that action should be based on communication between those involved , in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all . Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation , Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached . Like Kantian ethics , discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory , in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions . It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable , in a similar way to Kant 's ethics . Habermas argues that his ethical theory is an improvement on Kant 's ethics . He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant 's ethics . Kant distinguished between the phenomena world , which can be sensed and experienced by humans , and the noumena , or spiritual world , which is inaccessible to humans . This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent : although a human is bound in the phenomenal world , their actions are free in the intelligible world . For Habermas , morality arises from discourse , which is made necessary by their rationality and needs , rather than their freedom . = = = = John Rawls = = = = The social contract theory of political philosopher John Rawls , developed in his work A Theory of Justice , was influenced by Kant 's ethics . Rawls argued that a just society would be fair . To achieve this fairness , he proposed a hypothetical moment prior to the existence of a society , at which the society is ordered : this is the original position . This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance , where no one knows what their own position in society will be , preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result . Rawls ' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free , equal , and moral ; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality , which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice . Rawls dismissed much of Kant 's dualism , arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics , once reformulated , is clearer without it \u2014 he described this as one of the goals of A Theory of Justice . = = = = Jacques Lacan = = = = French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian ethics in his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade . Lacan argued that Sade 's maxim of jouissance \u2014 the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment \u2014 is morally acceptable by Kant 's criteria because it can be universalised . He proposed that , while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law , Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance . = = = Contemporary Kantian ethicists = = = = = = = Onora O 'Neill = = = = Philosopher Onora O 'Neill , who studied under John Rawls at Oxford University , is a contemporary Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach to issues of social justice . O 'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealisations or assumption . She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealising humans as autonomous beings , without any social context or life goals , though maintains that Kant 's ethics can be read without such an idealisation . O 'Neill prefers Kant 's conception of reason as practical and available to be used by humans , rather than as principles attached to every human being . Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all . If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle , then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it . To use reason , and to reason with other people , we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted . In this way , O 'Neill reached Kant 's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy . This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles , but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not . From this model of Kantian ethics , O 'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice . She argues that the rejection of certain principles , such as deception and coercion , provides a starting point for basic conceptions of justice , which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty . Nevertheless , she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding : there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles , such as injury . = = = = Marcia Baron = = = = In his paper The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories , philosopher Michael Stocker challenges Kantian ethics ( and all modern ethical theories ) by arguing that actions from duty lack certain moral value . He gives the example of Smith , who visits his friend in hospital out of duty , rather than because of the friendship ; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing . Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point . After presenting a number of reasons that we might find acting out of duty objectionable , she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is . Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong , but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do . Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal : one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships . Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive \u2014 that is , a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done , rather the prompts specific actions . She argues that , seen this way , duty neither reveals a deficiency in one 's natural inclinations to act , nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship . For Baron , being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act ; rather , it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding . A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions , such as questions of character . These should guide moral agents to act from duty . = = = Critics of Kantian ethics = = = = = = = G. W. F Hegel = = = = German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel presented two main criticisms of Kantian ethics . He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific information about what people should do because Kant 's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction . He argued that Kant 's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality . To illustrate this point , Hegel and his followers have presented a number of cases in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer . Hegel used Kant 's example of being trusted with another man 's money to argue that Kant 's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing , because either answer can entail contradictions . He also used the example of helping the poor : if everyone helped the poor , there would be no poor left to help , so beneficence would be impossible if universalised , making it immoral according to Kant 's model . Hegel 's second criticism was that Kant 's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire . For Hegel , it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason . This means that , by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality , Kant 's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral . = = = = Arthur Schopenhauer = = = = German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant 's belief that ethics should concern what ought to be done , insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and interpret what actually happens . Whereas Kant presented an idealised version of what ought to be done in a perfect world , Schopenhaur argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world , capable of being presented as a solution to the world 's problems . Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics , arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not the most important part of the discipline . Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught \u2014 a person is either virtuous or is not \u2014 he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people 's behaviour , rather than presenting unattainable universal laws . = = = = Friedrich Nietzsche = = = = Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticised all contemporary moral systems , with a special focus on Christian and Kantian ethics . He argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics : first , they make a metaphysical claim about the nature of humanity , which must be accepted for the system to have any normative force ; and second , the system benefits the interests of certain people , often over those of others . Although Nietzsche 's primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable ( he also objected to ethical theories that do not make such claims ) , his two main targets \u2014 Kantianism and Christianity \u2014 do make metaphysical claims , which therefore feature prominently in Nietzsche 's criticism . Nietzsche rejected fundamental components of Kant 's ethics , particularly his argument that morality , God and immorality can be shown through reason . Nietzsche cast suspicion on the use of moral intuition , which Kant used as the foundation of his morality , arguing that it has no normative force in ethics . He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant 's moral psychology , such as the will and pure reason . Like Kant , Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy ; however , he rejected Kant 's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others . A naturalist reading of Nietzsche 's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant 's conception of reason and desire . Under the Kantian model , reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision . Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations ; thus , when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives , it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another . This is in direct contrast with Kant 's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct ; instead , it is just another instinct . There is thus no self capable of standing back and making a decision ; the decision the self makes is simply determined by the strongest drive . Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche 's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self capable of standing back in the Kantian sense . For an individual to create values of their own , which is a key idea in Nietzsche 's philosophy , they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent . Even if the agent is influenced by their drives , he must regard them as his own , which undermines Nietzsche 's conception of autonomy . = = = = John Stuart Mill = = = = Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for not realising that moral laws are justified by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles ( that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought ) . Mill argued that Kant 's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism . As basis for morality , Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant 's reliance on reason , and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong . = = = = Virtue ethics = = = = Virtue ethics is a form of ethical theory which emphasises the character of an agent , rather than specific acts ; many of its proponents have criticised Kant 's deontological approach to ethics . Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories , including Kantian ethics , for their obsession with law and obligation . As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid , Anscombe suggested that , because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver , they are irrelevant in modern secular society . In his work After Virtue , Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant 's formulation of universalisability , arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test , such as \" Keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one \" . He further challenges Kant 's formulation of humanity as an ends in itself by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means : the maxim \" Let everyone except me be treated as a means \" , though seemingly immoral , can be universalised . Bernard Williams argues that , by abstracting persons from character , Kant misreprents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy . = = = = Catholic Church = = = = The Catholic Church has criticised Kantian ethics for its apparent contradiction , arguing that humans being co-legislators of morality contradicts the claim that morality is a priori . If something is universally a priori ( i.e. , existing unchangingly prior to experience ) , then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans , who have not always existed The theory of the categorical imperative is , moreover , inconsistent . According to it the human will is the highest lawgiving authority , and yet subject to precepts enjoined on it . Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers criticised the modern desire for ethics to be autonomous and free from the authorities such as the Church , a development he partially attributed to thinkers such as Kant . Pinckaers saw this as potentially threatening to the legitimacy of the Magisterium , but maintained that the link between the gospel and the moral law , and the shortcomings of human reason , leave a place for the moral authority of the Church . Pinckaers regarded Christian ethics as closer to the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant 's ethics . He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence , which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one 's virtues . Initially , this requires following rules \u2014 but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously , and regard acting morally as a joy . This is in contrast with freedom of indifference , which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant . On this view , freedom is set against nature : free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions . There is no development or progress in an agent 's virtue , merely the forming of habit . This is closer to Kant 's view of ethics , because Kant 's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions , and is set in contrast with Pinckaer 's conception of Christian ethics . = = Applications = = = = = Medical ethics = = = Kant believed that the shared ability of humans to reason should be the basis of morality , and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant . He therefore believed that all humans should have the right to common dignity and respect . Margaret Eaton argues that , according to Kant 's ethics , a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone , even if they were the patient themselves . For example , a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so . She also argues that Kant 's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment , making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients . Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient , so they must be informed of all facts , even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient . Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant 's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society , but are always treated as rational people with their own goals . Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally , not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means . He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses , the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies . Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient , Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable . In her work How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion , Susan Feldman argues that abortion should be defended according to Kantian ethics . She proposed that a woman should be treated as a dignified autonomous person , with control over their body , as Kant suggested . She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics , requiring abortion to be the mother 's decision . Dean Harris has noted that , if Kantian ethics is to be used in the discussion of abortion , it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person . Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals . Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age ( such as babies or fetuses ) or mental disability , agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves , equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion . = = = Sexual ethics = = = Kant viewed humans as being subject to the animalistic desires of self-preservation , species-preservation , and the preservation of enjoyment . He argued that humans have a duty to avoid maxims that harm or degrade themselves , including suicide , sexual degradation , and drunkenness . This led Kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it reduces humans to an object of pleasure . He admitted sex only within marriage , which he regarded as \" a merely animal union \" . He believed that masturbation is worse than suicide , reducing a person 's status to below that of an animal ; he argued that rape should be punished with castration and that bestiality requires expulsion from society . Feminist philosopher Catharine MacKinnon has argued that many contemporary practices would be deemed immoral by Kant 's standards because they dehumanise women . Sexual harassment , prostitution and pornography , she argues , objectify women and do not meet Kant 's standard of human autonomy . Commercial sex has been criticised for turning both parties into objects ( and thus using them as a means to an end ) ; mutual consent is problematic because in consenting , people choose to objectify themselves . Alan Soble has noted that more liberal Kantian ethicists believe that , depending on other contextual factors , the consent of women can vindicate their participation in pornography and prostitution . = = = Animal ethics = = = Because Kant viewed rationality as the basis for being a moral patient \u2014 one due moral consideration \u2014 he believed that animals have no moral rights . Animals , according to Kant , are not rational , thus one cannot behave immorally towards them . Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals , Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes towards human beings : if we become accustomed to harming animals , then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable . Ethicist Tom Regan rejects Kant 's assessment of the moral worth of animals on three main points : First , he rejects Kant 's claim that animals are not self-conscious . He then challenges Kant 's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make moral judgement . Regan argues that , if a being 's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgement , then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration . Regan finally argues that Kant 's assertion that animals exist merely as a means to an ends is unsupported ; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that , like humans , they have their own ends . = = = Lying = = = Kant believed that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that we ought not to lie in any circumstances , even if we are trying to bring about good consequences , such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim . Kant argued that , because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be , the result might be unexpectedly harmful . Therefore , we ought to act to avoid the known wrong \u2014 lying \u2014 rather than to avoid a potential wrong . If there are harmful consequences , we are blameless because we acted according to our duty . Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently : the maxim ' I will lie to save an innocent life ' can be universalised . However , this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end , which we have a duty to avoid doing . Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant 's example .",
                "Exclusion of judicial review in Singapore law = Exclusion of judicial review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power . Typically , this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament , or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively . Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom . The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are , subject to some exceptions , not effective in denying or restricting the extent to which the courts are able to exercise judicial review . In contrast , Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law , but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law . A partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period , after which no remedy will be available . Such clauses are generally effective , unless the public authority has acted in bad faith . Similarly , the existence of bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts . In the absence of bad faith , the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses . In general , subjectively worded powers are also viewed restrictively by the Singapore courts . In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal took the view that an objective test applied to the exercise of discretion conferred by the Internal Security Act ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) ( \" ISA \" ) on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs concerning the detention without trial of persons thought to be a risk to national security . Hence , the jurisdiction of the High Court was not completely ousted , and it could objectively examine whether the relevant decision-makers had exercised their powers properly . However , legislative amendments to the ISA in 1989 reversed the effect of Chng Suan Tze by mandating that the courts are to apply a subjective test to the exercise of the discretion , and by excluding judicial review except where there is doubt whether the procedures set out in the Act were adhered to . Nevertheless , the subjective test is only applicable in the context of the ISA , and the rule that an objective test applies to subjectively worded powers continues to apply where statutes other than the ISA are concerned . = = Total ouster or finality clauses = = An ouster clause in a statute is an attempt by the legislature to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts . Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage . One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause , which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court . The main legal issue with ouster clauses is whether it is in fact possible to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts by the use of carefully drafted provisions . Thio Li-ann has noted that \" courts generally loathe ouster clauses as these contradict the rule of law whereby judges finally declare the legal limits of power and also as the individual 's ultimate recourse to the law is denied . Hence , courts try to construe these strictly to minimise their impact . In so doing , they may be going against the grain of parliamentary will . \" Ouster clauses are related to another administrative law concept : jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law . Traditionally , at common law , an ouster clause precludes a court from interfering with a decision made by a public authority which was acting within its jurisdiction , but committed a non-jurisdictional error of law . However , the clause is not effective in preventing judicial review of errors of law that affect the jurisdiction of the authority to make the decision . For instance , in R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal , ex parte Gilmore ( 1957 ) , Lord Justice of Appeal Alfred Denning said that it was \" well settled that the remedy by certiorari is never to be taken away by any statute except by the most clear and explicit words . The word ' final ' is not enough . \" The effect of such a clause is to make \" the decision final on the facts , but not final on the law . Notwithstanding that the decision is by a statute made ' final , ' certiorari can still issue for excess of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record . \" However , in the light of developments in the law , such a differentiation may no longer be applicable depending on the judicial school of thought employed . = = = UK position = = = = = = = General rule = = = = The starting point for analysing ouster clauses and their effects is the landmark decision Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission ( 1968 ) . In that case , the House of Lords is regarded as having abolished the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law when it was considering the effect of an ouster clause . In Anisminic , their Lordships were faced with a provision which stated that \" the determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law \" . In his judgment , Lord Reid differentiated between the arguments put forth by the parties . He held that while the respondents had argued that the provision clearly denied the court the ability to question the determination made by the Foreign Compensation Commission , the question at hand did not even involve the questioning of the purported determination and instead focused on whether there was in fact a valid determination . He pointed out that \" if you seek to show that a determination is a nullity you are not questioning the purported determination \u2013 you are maintaining that it does not exist as a determination \" . He then held it was a well-established principle that a provision ousting the ordinary jurisdiction of the court must be construed strictly \u2013 if such a provision is reasonably capable of having two meanings , the meaning which preserves the ordinary jurisdiction of the court should be taken . If Parliament had intended to introduce a new kind of ouster clause that would protect such nullities from being questioned , better drafting of the provision would be required . In his judgment , Lord Reid also took the opportunity to deal with the issue of jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law . While recognizing the traditional understanding that jurisdictional errors of law are of no effect , his Lordship also stated that there are many cases where although the decision-maker has jurisdiction to decide , the determination is also a nullity . He then gave a non-exhaustive list of these cases : The decision-maker may have given its decision in bad faith . It may have made a decision which it had no power to make . It may have failed in the course of the inquiry to comply with the requirements of natural justice . It may , in perfect good faith , have misconstrued the provisions giving it power to act so that it failed to deal with the question remitted to it and decided some question which was not remitted to it . It may have refused to take into account something which it was required to take into account . It may have based its decision on some matter which , under the legal provisions establishing the decision-maker , it had no right to take into account . However , what is of significance is that his Lordship did not expressly reject the effectiveness of such ouster clauses where the decision is valid . He recognized that \" [ u ] ndoubtedly such a provision protects every determination which is not a nullity \" . Peter Cane has written that Lord Reid thus affirmed that \" the ouster clause in question would be effective to prevent the award of a judicial review remedy only if the error of law was within jurisdiction \" . However , it appears that Anisminic had defined the concept of jurisdictional error of law so broadly that it had made redundant the old divide between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors and had \" led to the use of the word ' jurisdictional ' in a wide sense to cover all errors of law which entailed illegality \" . The judgment thus had the effect of reducing the effect of statutory ouster clauses and expanding the limits of judicial review . Later cases have treated Anisminic as implying that any action committed in error by an administrative agency or body is deemed to affect the jurisdiction of the body to carry out the action , and hence is reviewable by a court of law despite the ouster clause . The blurred distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law was recognized and discussed in R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council , ex parte Page ( 1992 ) . The House of Lords reviewed the development of general principles of judicial review since Anisminic and concluded that the courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision-making bodies are exercised lawfully . In his judgment , Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred to O 'Reilly v. Mackman ( 1983 ) and opined that \" the decision in [ Anisminic ] rendered obsolete the distinction between errors of law on the face of the record and other errors of law by extending the doctrine of ultra vires . \" Thus , an ouster clause is ineffective when the decision-maker has acted unlawfully , whether the unlawfulness is jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional in nature . This is because \" Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis : a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires \" . The issue was revisited in the subsequent case of R. ( on the application of Cart ) v. Upper Tribunal ( 2011 ) . The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom disapproved of certain pronouncements by the lower courts which appeared to signal a return to the pre-Anisminic position . According to Lord Dyson , this was not justified as \" the importance of Anisminic is that it showed that a material error of law renders a decision a ' nullity ' so that the decision is in principle judicially reviewable \" . He went on to state that \" as a matter of principle , there is no justification for drawing the line at jurisdictional error \" . In his opinion , any restrictions on judicial review require justification and , prima facie , such review should be available to challenge the legality of decisions of public bodies . = = = = Exceptions = = = = = = = = = Decisions under domestic laws ; court decisions = = = = = Despite the extensiveness of the ruling in Anisminic , it appears that there may be instances where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide . Cane has noted that there are three views . The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant , while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction . The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view . This middle ground approach was discussed in ex parte Page when their Lordships dealt with whether the court can intervene and review a decision made by a visitor ( overseer ) of a university . Lord Browne-Wilkinson found that there were two reasons why the general rule that all errors of law are reviewable does not apply to visitors . First , the reason why courts can intervene in a normal case where the decision is considered ultra vires is because the law applicable to a decision made by such a body is the general law of the land . The visitor in ex parte Page did not apply the general law of the land but , rather , a \" domestic law \" ( the university 's charter and statutes ) of which he was the sole arbiter and over which the courts had no cognizance . Therefore , the visitor \" cannot err in law in reaching [ his ] decision since the general law is not the applicable law \" . Secondly , there is a difference between the kinds of tribunals the decisions of which are being considered for judicial review . The source of this reasoning is the dissenting judgment of Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane in Pearlman v. Keepers and Governors of Harrow School ( 1978 ) . Lord Browne-Wilkinson noted that this dissenting judgment was approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn . Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union ( 1980 ) , and also by a majority in Re Racal Communications Ltd . ( 1980 ) . In the latter case , Lord Diplock highlighted that the decision in Anisminic only applies to administrative bodies or tribunals as there is a presumption that Parliament does not intend such bodies to be the final arbiters of questions of law . This can be contrasted with courts of law in respect of which such a presumption is not present . Instead , the presumption is that \" where Parliament had provided that the decision of an inferior court was final and conclusive the High Court should not be astute to find that the inferior court 's decision on a question of law had not been made final and conclusive , thereby excluding the jurisdiction to review it . \" The views expressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson have been questioned by Cane . As regards the first reason , he has argued that the distinction between domestic law and general law is problematic . Such institutions may actually operate under a statutory framework which can result in a mixed issue of both general and domestic law arising . As such , the view taken by Lord Browne-Wilkinson cannot be as cleanly applied as he had described it to be . Moreover , the actual scope of ex parte Page has yet to be resolved . There is some uncertainty as to the extent the exception applies to decision-makers other than visitors . Where the second reason is concerned , Cane has noted that the correctness of the distinction between administrative tribunals and courts may be questionable as such an approach was \" rejected by a Divisional Court and , apparently , by Lord Diplock himself . \" = = = = = Comprehensive tribunal system to correct errors of law = = = = = Another exception can be found in the Cart judgment . Having affirmed the position taken in Anisminic , Lord Dyson then qualified his statement by emphasizing that \" the scope of judicial review should be no more ( as well as no less ) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law \" . On the facts of the case , he found it was neither proportionate nor necessary for the maintenance of the rule of law to require unrestricted judicial review . By enacting the Tribunals , Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 , Parliament had rationalized the system of administrative tribunals and had created the Upper Tribunal to hear appeals from lower tribunals , thus avoiding the ordinary courts from being overwhelmed by judicial review applications . As the system of tribunals provided ample opportunity for the correction of errors of law , this substantive policy reason precluded the need for all decisions of the Upper Tribunal to be subject to judicial review . Thus , judicial review would only be permitted from an Upper Tribunal decision if it would \" raise some important point of principle or practice \" or there was \" some other compelling reason \" . = = = Singapore position = = = The High Court case of Re Application by Yee Yut Ee ( 1978 ) suggests that the pre-Anisminic position on ouster clauses applies in Singapore ; that is , the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law persists , and an ouster clause is only ineffective where a jurisdictional error of law has been committed . The ouster clause in question was section 46 of the Industrial Relations Act which states : Subject to the provisions of this Act an award shall be final and conclusive , and no award or decision or order of a Court or the President or a referee shall be challenged , appealed against , reviewed , quashed , or called in question in any court and shall not be subject to certiorari , prohibition , mandamus or injunction in any court on any account . The Court neither expressly rejected nor affirmed the abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses . Instead , the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction on the part of the decision-maker , a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic . The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all . Ultimately , the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction . In Stansfield Business International Pte . Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower ( 1999 ) , an employee fired for incompetence accused the plaintiff company of unfair dismissal and made representations to the Minister for Manpower under section 14 of the Employment Act to be reinstated . After investigating this claim , the Ministry came to the conclusion that the dismissal was made without just cause and recommended payment to the employee . Although section 14 ( 5 ) of the Employment Act provides that \" the decision of the Minister on any representation made under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be challenged in any court \" , the company applied for judicial review against the Minister 's decision . The High Court held that the ouster clause in section 14 ( 5 ) of the Employment Act was ineffective as there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice in the process by which the Minister 's decision was reached . In his judgment , Justice Warren L. H. Khoo stated that the \" broad principle \" in Anisminic governing the matter had been restated in the case of South East Asia Fire Bricks as follows : [ W ] hen words in a statute oust the power of the High Court to review decisions of an inferior tribunal by certiorari , they must be construed strictly ... they will not have the effect of ousting that power if the inferior tribunal has acted without jurisdiction or \" if it has done or failed to do something in the course of the inquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity \" : per Lord Reid at p . 171 [ of Anisminic ] . But if the inferior tribunal has merely made an error of law which does not affect its jurisdiction , and if its decision is not a nullity for some reason such as breach of the rules of natural justice , then the ouster will be effective . In a 2010 lecture to students of the Singapore Management University School of Law , Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong briefly discussed the decision in Stansfield . He pointed out that Justice Khoo 's statements on Anisminic were obiter dicta because the decision had been \" based on a breach of natural justice and not the doctrine of error of law \" . He also considered an academic argument that an ouster clause may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Singapore Constitution which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts . Chief Justice Chan stated that if this proposition was answered in the affirmative , it would follow that the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts cannot be ousted , and there would thus be no need for Singapore courts to draw the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law . Nevertheless , he highlighted the fact that he was not expressing an opinion on the issue . = = Partial ouster or time limit clauses = = Unlike a total ouster or finality clause which seeks to preclude judicial review entirely , a partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available . Such clauses are generally effective , unless the public authority has acted in bad faith , in which case the decision impugned may be subject to judicial review even though the time permitted for challenging it has lapsed . In Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council ( 1956 ) , the House of Lords concluded by a majority that they could not impugn a partial ouster clause because , according to Viscount Simonds , \" plain words must be given their plain meaning \" , even though fraud on the part of the public authority had been alleged . In contrast , Lord Reid gave a dissenting opinion in which he doubted whether an order that had been obtained by corrupt or fraudulent means could be protected from being questioned in court . Despite the subsequent ruling in Anisminic , in R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment , ex parte Ostler ( 1976 ) the Court of Appeal of England and Wales applied Smith and upheld the validity of a partial ouster clause that gave the applicants six weeks to challenge a decision . Lord Denning , the Master of the Rolls , explained that upholding partial ouster clauses promoted the certainty of the executive 's actions . It would not be in the public interest if applicants could challenge decisions after the time limit for doing so had expired , as this would delay actions taken by the executive . As Lord Justice of Appeal Michael Mann put it in R. v. Cornwall County Council , ex parte Huntington ( 1992 ) : The intention of Parliament when it uses an Anisminic clause is that questions as to validity are not excluded . When paragraphs such as those considered in ex p . Ostler are used , then the legislative intention is that questions as to invalidity may be raised on the specified grounds in the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner , but that otherwise the jurisdiction of the court is excluded in the interest of certainty . = = Conclusive evidence clauses = = Provisions in statutes declaring that certain decisions by public authorities shall be conclusive evidence of some facts have been found by the Singapore courts to be valid , and therefore have the effect of preventing applicants from challenging most \u2013 but not all \u2013 of such decisions by way of judicial review . In Galstaun v. Attorney-General ( 1980 ) , the applicant alleged that the Collector of Land Revenue had compulsorily acquired more of his land that was required for public purposes pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act . The High Court held that the argument had to be rejected in the light of section 5 ( 3 ) of the Act , which provided that the President 's declaration that land was needed for a public purpose \" shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for the purpose specified therein \" . The Court said : \" When the Government declares that a certain purpose is a public purpose it must be presumed that the Government is in possession of facts which induce the Government to declare that the purpose is a public purpose \" . However , in Teng Fuh Holdings Pte . Ltd. v. Collector of Land Revenue ( 2006 ) , the Court clarified that section 5 ( 3 ) cannot prevent judicial intervention if there is evidence that the Government exercised its power of compulsory acquisition in bad faith . = = Subjectively worded powers = = Another method employed by the legislature to restrict judicial review by the courts is to cast statutory language in a subjective form . A subjectively worded power suggests that the discretion to exercise this power rests entirely with the minister , statutory body or agency referred to , in which case the view might be taken that a court should not query how the power has been exercised . Examples of subjectively worded powers include powers that are stated to be exercisable \" if the Minister so directs \" or \" as the Minister thinks fit \" . However , as with ouster clauses , courts have traditionally displayed resistance to such provisions . In practice , they are subject to the normal grounds of judicial review set forth in the UK case Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( \" the GCHQ case \" , 1983 ) ; in other words , the exercise of power may be invalidated if determined to be illegal , irrational or procedurally improper . = = = In the Internal Security Act = = = = = = = Subjective or objective test ? = = = = Section 8 ( 1 ) of the Internal Security Act ( \" ISA \" ) empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to detain a person without trial if the President \" is satisfied \" that this step is necessary because the person is , among other things , a threat to national security . Section 10 of the Act states that the Minister can direct that a detention order be suspended subject to conditions \" as the Minister sees fit \" , and can also revoke such a direction \" if he is satisfied \" that the detainee failed to observe any condition or if it is necessary in the public interest to do so . In the seminal Court of Appeal decision Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the respondents submitted that the President 's discretion under section 8 ( 1 ) was subjective , and so was not open to review by the courts . The appellants argued that the discretion was objective , and thus a court of law could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised . The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10 , and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review . In coming to this decision , it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision , Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs , which had held to the contrary . While the Court 's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter , later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach . It gave several reasons for its decision . First , the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable , and , secondly , such a test was inconsistent with Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution . Finally , the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary to the rule of law and all powers had legal limits . = = = = 1989 legislative intervention = = = = On 25 January 1989 , the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 and the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 were passed by Parliament to confirm the applicability of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive 's discretionary powers under the ISA . These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively . Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill , Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts ' application of an objective test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive 's functions in matters pertaining to national security , which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with . Its stance was that the objective test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine . Moreover , the judicial process , unlike executive decision-making , was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats . The courts , unlike the executive , lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters , and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive . Furthermore , the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions . Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore 's local conditions , the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA . Jayakumar said that while the Government recognized that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA , the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts to impair this judicial check . Instead , the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power . The amendments to the Constitution paved the way for intended amendments to the ISA . The new Article 149 ( 3 ) stated that if the issue of the validity of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister for Home Affairs arose in any court proceedings commenced before or after 27 January 1989 , it was to be determined in accordance with any law enacted by Parliament for this purpose , and Article 93 of the Constitution could not be relied upon to invalidate such a law . Pursuant to Article 149 ( 3 ) , Parliament then inserted new sections into the ISA . In particular , section 8B ( 1 ) confirmed the judgment in Lee Mau Seng by declaring that \" the law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the provisions of this Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971 ; and no part of the law before , on or after that date of any other country in the Commonwealth relating to judicial review shall apply \" . In addition , section 8B ( 1 ) was made subject to section 8B ( 2 ) , which seeks to oust judicial review in any court of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister under the ISA , save where there is any question which relates to compliance with any procedural requirement of the ISA governing such acts or decisions . Jayakumar said in Parliament that section 8B ( 2 ) sought not only to prevent the courts from questioning the soundness of the subjective test , but also to anticipate any legal challenges on the basis that the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng only applies to the judicial review of detention orders and not to other acts or decisions under the ISA by the President or Minister , such as suspension directions and revocations of such directions . = = = = Operation of subjectively worded powers in the ISA after the 1989 amendments = = = = The 1989 amendments to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1989 ) . Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B ( 1 ) and 8B ( 2 ) of the ISA govern judicial review in the context of that Act , and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze . Therefore , applying the subjective test , the respondents ' burden of justifying the legality of the applicant 's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President , acting on the advice of the Cabinet , that the applicant was a risk to national security . The applicant then appealed to the Court of Appeal . The Court of Appeal construed section 8B ( 1 ) in accordance with the clear legislative intention expressed through the plain wording of the provision . It held that the provision reinstates the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of decisions made or acts done pursuant to the executive 's powers under the ISA . In order to determine the law on judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA , it is necessary to ascertain the exact decision laid down in Lee Mau Seng . However , the Court declined to opine whether the Lee Mau Seng decision meant that a detention order cannot be challenged on the basis that it was made for reasons completely outside the scope of the ISA . This was because on the facts of the case it had not been established that the applicant was re-detained for reasons not contemplated by section 8 ( 1 ) of the ISA and completely unrelated to national security . Notably , the Court did not decide whether section 8B ( 2 ) of the ISA precludes it from reviewing a detention order shown to have been made for purposes other than national security , or whether the 1989 amendments to the ISA are outside the scope of the legislative power conferred on Parliament by the amended Article 149 of the Constitution . = = = In other statutes = = = Due to the 1989 amendments to the Constitution and the ISA , the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts , except when there has been some non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act . On the other hand , the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA . In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General ( 2011 ) , the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze . Apart from restricting the courts ' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety , Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion \u2013 that is , power without legal limits \u2013 is contrary to the rule of law , which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power . Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze , it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle . In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1992 ) , the statutory provision in question was section 30 of the Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions ) Act ( \" CLTPA \" ) , which states as follows : Whenever the Minister [ of Home Affairs ] is satisfied with respect to any person , whether the person is at large or in custody , that the person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature , the Minister may , with the consent of the Public Prosecutor \u2014 ( a ) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be detained in the interests of public safety , peace and good order , by order under his hand direct that the person be detained for any period not exceeding 12 months from the date of the order ; or ( b ) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be subject to the supervision of the police , by order direct that the person be subject to the supervision of the police for any period not exceeding 3 years from the date of the order . [ Emphasis added . ] The Court of Appeal suggested that , in the light of Chng Suan Tze , the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister . Moreover , in Re Wong Sin Yee ( 2007 ) , which also involved judicial review of an applicant 's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA , the High Court , following the decision in Chng Suan Tze , held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review as regards the exercise of the Minister 's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review . The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30 ; if it Court had applied a subjective test , it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety , peace and good order . = = = Cases = = = Anisminic Ltd. v.

It forms a western bypass of Winchester , connecting to Interstate 81 at both ends . Although the road is a freeway , neither I-81 connection is freeway standard ; the south end ( exit 310 ) is a diamond interchange with two traffic signals , while , at the north end , drivers must use a short piece of U.S. Route 11 to connect with I-81 at exit 317 . In addition to local access , the highway connects to U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 522 , two major highways that lead west and northwest into West Virginia and north to Interstate 70 at Hancock , Maryland . An eastern bypass , known locally as \" Route 37 East \" , has been proposed in statewide and local plans to complete the loop . = = Route description = = Route 37 begins at an intersection with Hillandale Road ( SR 847 ) , a local frontage road along the east side of I-81 , and Tasker Road ( SR 642 ) , which leads southeast to US 522 near Armel . It immediately crosses I-81 at exit 310 , a diamond interchange with two traffic signals on SR 37 , and then becomes a freeway , soon junctioning US 11 ( Valley Pike ) with a partial cloverleaf . The next interchange is a diamond at Cedar Creek Grade ( SR 622 ) , and SR 37 reaches its approximate midpoint at US 50 ( Northwestern Pike ) , another diamond . A trumpet interchange completed in 2001 connects to the Winchester Medical Center , and the final diamond is with US 522 ( Frederick Pike ) at the northwestern corner . SR 37 ends at a partial Y interchange with US 11 ( Martinsburg Pike ) , at which SR 37 traffic can only access US 11 north and only traffic from US 11 south can access SR 37 , although a northbound exit to Cives Lane was added in about 2000 to allow SR 37 traffic to access US 11 south . About 1 / 2 mile ( 1 km ) of US 11 is a divided highway , connecting SR 37 with I-81 at exit 317 . = = Future = = In early Fall 2014 VDOT will start work at Route 37 's southern terminus ' exit at I-81 . They will extend Route 37 north to a new diamond interchange with Front Royal Pike ( US 522 ) . Then Route 37 will continue northward to Millwood Pike ( US 50 / US 17 ) and have another diamond interchange . The next exit will be at Senseny Road ( State Route 657 ) with another diamond interchange . The next and final exit will be a half cloverleaf interchange with VA 7 , but it is not final that it will be a half cloverleaf because of Valley Mill Road ( State Route 659 ) . The problem with this is that the intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7 . = = History = = Route 37 was defined as the proposed Winchester By-Pass by 1963 , and was included in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964 . When I-81 opened past Winchester in November 1965 , it included an interchange south of Winchester , taking traffic between I-81 and US 11 along a short connecting road . The north half of the bypass , from US 50 west of Winchester north and east to US 11 north of the city , opened in the late 1960s , and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s , with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81 / US 11 connection . A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built , but otherwise the diamond interchange was not modified . The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new trumpet interchange serving the Winchester Medical Center ; construction began in September 2000 and was completed in November 2001 . A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane , allowing traffic at the north end of the bypass to access US 11 south , was built in about 2000 . = = Major intersections = = The entire route is in Frederick County .",

                    "text": "Blame Game = \" Blame Game \" is a song by American hip-hop recording artist Kanye West from his fifth studio album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) . The song features recording artist John Legend and was produced by West , Justin Franks , and Mike Dean . The song features a hip hop skit provided by comedian Chris Rock . It contains a sample of \" Avril 14th \" , written by Richard D. James , known primarily by his pseudonym , Aphex Twin . Lyrically , the song contains West 's thoughts on past break-ups and explores themes of unrequited love , heartbreak , and spousal abuse . Midway through the song , Rock delivers an extended monologue as the new boyfriend of West 's past lover . Critics were generally complimentary and praised Legend 's vocal delivery . The appearance by Rock was widely noted as a surprising element of the song and received mixed criticism , though some critics described it as a highlight . It charted on the South Korean Gaon Chart at position 81 . West and Legend performed \" Blame Game \" together on Vevo Presents GOOD Music at SXSW . The song was featured in West 's 2010 short film Runaway . West planned to produce a music video for the song featuring Amber Rose but she declined the offer of appearing and West scrapped the video . = = Background = = \" Blame Game \" was recorded in Oahu , Hawaii , where most of the sessions for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy took place . West opted to work with more familiar songwriters to maintain artistic privacy and keep a low profile after several of his publicized controversies . West recorded the song with vocalist John Legend , a frequent collaborator of his since West 's 2004 debut album The College Dropout . During an appearance on Ustream , West announced that Legend was set to appear on a song from his currently upcoming album , titled \" Blame Game \" . During the announcement , West cited \" Blame Game \" as his favorite song from the album , which was at the time unfinished . The song developed from Legend and West 's brainstorming , which also led to several other tracks , including \" All of the Lights \" . Rapper Pusha T was erroneously reported to have provided backing vocals on the song . West asked comedian Chris Rock to appear on the song . Rock , a fan of West 's , mused that he was more than happy to collaborate with West , and said , \" you 'd be amazed at how many people want to work with you if you just ask , if you just make a call . \" He had previously collaborated on other hip hop songs , such as with rappers Ludacris , Ol ' Dirty Bastard , and Ice Cube on the track \" You Ain 't Gotta Lie ( Ta Kick It ) \" . Rock described his collaboration with West as exciting in nature , commenting that he was always open to working on unusual ventures . In an interview with The New York Times , Rock went into detail about the composition of the song : \u201c I did that quicker than I read scripts that they offer me money to do ... I thank [ Kanye ] so much it probably freaks him out . Especially at this late date , to get on something , the album of the moment , that stuff is priceless , you can \u2019 t put a price tag on that . I felt invigorated by it . I \u2019 ve still got my fastball . \" The song is partly inspired by West 's relationship with model Amber Rose . West originally met Rose in 2008 , and they subsequently developed a romantic relationship , before having a dramatic break-up in 2010 ; Rose cited allegations of adultery . Rose also said that West had written the song about their relationship , commenting that West \" talked reckless about me on his album \" . = = Composition = = The track is built on a recreation of electronic musician Aphex Twin 's piano composition \" Avril 14th \" . The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend . \" Blame Game \" has a lush , cello-driven production with predominant piano . After Legend 's introduction , West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner , almost singing his lines . West 's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt . The song 's soulful sound juxtaposes West 's angry lyrics : \" been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom , ripping you up , fuckin ' and chokin ' you \" . He subsequently raps less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses \" I can 't love you this much \" . West 's vocals are substantially manipulated throughout the song from \" naturally clear-sounding and ominously pitched-down as it pans back and forth \" , as they are slowed down , sped up , edited substantially , and altered in various ways , giving the song a brooding , ominous mood . Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Dombal wrote that this effect \" bottoms out with a verse in which Kanye 's voice is sped up , slowed down and stretched out ... The effect is almost psychotic , suggesting three or four inner monologues fighting over smashed emotions . \" AbsolutePunk 's Drew Beringer commented that the vocal altercations gives the sense of the \" multiple personalities and paranoia he tries to overcome . \" On \" Blame Game \" , West attempts to call his past lover , but he receives a call back instead and he hears a conversation between her and Chris Rock , who begins an extended monologue approximately five minutes into the song . Chris Rock performs a vulgar , profanity-ridden sketch in which he compliments his lover 's dress sense and sexual technique , and asks her who taught her these skills . Each time he asks , the answer is the same : \" Yeezy taught me . \" . Andy Gill of The Independent commented that a similar \" alliance of aristocratic piano and cello with less rarefied elements underpins ' Blame Game ' , a brutal rumination on West 's sexual appetite \" . = = Reception = = \" Blame Game \" generally pleased contemporary critics . The Village Voice 's Sean Fennessey said that it is \" not the flashiest or most forward-thinking song on the album , but certainly the most earthbound . And therefore the most important . \" Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner complimented Rock 's \" hilarious , X-rated spiel \" and cited the song as the best example of West 's ability \" to contrast the light and dark pieces against each other , the profane and the sacred \" , writing that it utilizes \" Legend 's soft , pretty voice to sing a smooth , troubling refrain . \" Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield called it one of the funniest of West 's career , a \" confessional \" song where he \" honestly struggles to figure out why he has to be such a douchebag . \" Steve Jones of USA Today cited the song as the album 's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance that \" plays out with growing hostility over John Legend 's moody piano work . \" Nitsuh Abebe of New York mused that the song successfully showcased a \" gloomy and elegiac \" presentation . David Browne of Time called it \" that rare , effortless fusion of penthouse-boudoir R & B and hip hop grit \" , but was ambivalent about its segue \" into an interminable , decidedly unfunny skit in which a guy keeps asking a woman how she learned such mind-boggling bedroom moves . \" In contrast , Kitty Empire of The Guardian felt that \" comedian Chris Rock is hilariously foul-mouthed at the end of Blame Game . \" Becky Bain of Idolator called the song epic , but felt that Rock 's appearance served as a detriment to the song , writing ; \" we \u2019 d kill the last two minutes with Rock \u2019 s unfocused , not-as-funny-as-we-think-it \u2019 s-supposed-to-be rambling , but otherwise , this is quite a beautiful track . \" \" Blame Game \" charted on South Korean Gaon Chart at position 81 . = = Marketing = = The song was also featured in Runaway , a 35-minute music video directed by West set to music from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . After a traumatic dinner sequence , the song is played during a tense moment between West and the phoenix . At the Vevo Presents GOOD Music musical presentation , the song was performed by both West and Legend together . The two performed a few song together before Legend performed his own single \" Ordinary People \" separately . A planned music video for the song was going to feature an appearance by Amber Rose , however she declined the offer . Rose commented that she passed on the video because she \" just felt like Chris Rock 's part was disrespectful \" , believing that the song painted her in a negative light . Another reason for her declining to appear in the video because of her then-current relationship with rapper Wiz Khalifa , feeling that appearing in an ex-boyfriend 's musical venture would be disrespectful to Khalifa . West told Rose that both \" Blame Game \" and the Runaway film were partially inspired by his relationship with her . = = Personnel = = Credits adapted from liner notes for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) .

Three of the ships attempted to blockade Prussian ports in the Baltic Sea in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War . Three others patrolled the North Sea and the Atlantic , while the last ship was en route to Japan when the war began and blockaded two small Prussian ships in a Japanese harbor . Afterwards they alternated periods of reserve and active commissions , many of them abroad . Three of the ships participated in the French occupation of Tunisia in 1881 while another helped to intimidate the Vietnamese Government into accepting status as a French protectorate and played a small role in the Sino-French War of 1884 \u2013 85 . = = Design and description = = The Alma-class ironclads were designed by Henri Dupuy de L\u00f4me as improved versions of the armored corvette Belliqueuse suitable for foreign deployments . Unlike their predecessor the ships were true central battery ironclads as they were fitted with armored transverse bulkheads . The original plan for these ships was to have a two-deck battery with four 194-millimeter ( 7.6 in ) guns on the battery deck and four 164-millimeter ( 6.5 in ) guns mounted above them on the upper deck , one gun at each corner of the battery . This design was changed to substitute four barbettes for the upper battery , but the addition of armored bulkheads proved to be very heavy and the rear pair of barbettes had to be deleted to save weight . In partial compensation the 164-millimeter guns in the remaining forward barbettes were replaced by an additional pair of 194-millimeter guns . Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram . The ships were built from the same general plan , but differed amongst themselves . They measured 68.75 \u2013 69.03 meters ( 225.6 \u2013 226.5 ft ) between perpendiculars , with a beam of 13.94 \u2013 14.13 meters ( 45.7 \u2013 46.4 ft ) . The ships had a mean draft of 6.26 \u2013 6.66 meters ( 20.5 \u2013 21.9 ft ) and displaced 3,569 \u2013 3,889 metric tons ( 3,513 \u2013 3,828 long tons ) . Their crew numbered 316 officers and men . = = = Propulsion = = = The Alma-class ships had a single horizontal return connecting-rod steam engine driving a single propeller . Their engine was powered by four oval boilers . On sea trials the engine produced between 1,585 \u2013 1,896 indicated horsepower ( 1,182 \u2013 1,414 kW ) and the ships reached 10.48 \u2013 11.99 knots ( 19.41 \u2013 22.21 km / h ; 12.06 \u2013 13.80 mph ) . Unlike the single funnels of the others , Jeanne d 'Arc and Th\u00e9tis had two funnels , mounted side-by-side . The ships carried 250 metric tons ( 250 long tons ) of coal which allowed the ship to steam for 1,310 \u2013 1,620 nautical miles ( 2,430 \u2013 3,000 km ; 1,510 \u2013 1,860 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) .

The other two 194-millimeter guns were mounted in barbettes on the upper deck , sponsoned out over the sides of the ship . The four 120-millimeter ( 4.7 in ) guns were also mounted on the upper deck . Alma is the only ship positively known to have exchanged her 194 mm guns for newer Mod\u00e8le 1870 guns . The armor-piercing shell of the 20-caliber Mle 1870 gun weighed 165.3 pounds ( 75.0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 7.83 long tons ( 7.96 t ) . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of 1,739 ft / s ( 530 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 12.5 inches ( 320 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . = = = Armor = = = The Alma-class ships had a complete 150-millimeter ( 5.9 in ) wrought iron waterline belt , approximately 2.4 meters ( 7.9 ft ) high . The sides of the battery itself were armored with 120 millimeters ( 4.7 in ) of wrought iron and the ends of the battery were closed by bulkheads of the same thickness . The barbette armor was 100 millimeters ( 3.9 in ) thick , backed by 240 millimeters ( 9.4 in ) of wood . The unarmored portions of their sides were protected by 15-millimeter ( 0.6 in ) iron plates . = = Construction = = = = Service = = During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 \u2013 71 Th\u00e9tis , Jeanne d 'Arc and Armide were assigned to the Northern Squadron that attempted to blockade Prussian ports on the Baltic until ordered to return to Cherbourg on 16 September 1870 . Montcalm , Atalante , and Reine Blanche cruised the North Sea and Montcalm later watched a Prussian corvette in Portuguese waters . Alma was en route to the Far East when the war began and she blockaded a pair of Prussian corvettes in Yokohama harbor once she arrived at Japan . After the end of the war many of the ships were placed in reserve or sent to foreign stations , often as the flagship . During the Third Carlist War of 1872 \u2013 76 Th\u00e9tis , Reine Blanche and Jeanne d 'Arc spent time in Spanish waters where they could protect French citizens and interests . In 1875 the latter ship rammed and sank the dispatch vessel Forfait . On 3 July 1877 Th\u00e9tis rammed Reine Blanche who had to be run ashore to prevent her from sinking . Further abroad Reine Blanche and Alma bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia . Atalante participated in the Battle of Thuan An in August 1883 . This was an attack by the French on the forts defending the mouth of the Perfume River , leading to the Vietnamese capital of Hu\u1ebf in an attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese government . During the Sino-French War of 1884 \u2013 85 the ship was in Hu\u1ebf in early September 1884 , but she carried Admiral Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Courbet to Keelung , Taiwan on 23 September .",

                    "text": "Canons of page construction = The canons of page construction are a set of principles in the field of book design used to describe the ways that page proportions , margins and type areas ( print spaces ) of books are constructed . The notion of canons , or laws of form , of book page construction was popularized by Jan Tschichold in the mid to late twentieth century , based on the work of J. A. van de Graaf , Ra\u00fal M. Rosarivo , Hans Kayser , and others . Tschichold wrote , \u201c Though largely forgotten today , methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed for centuries . To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought to life and applied . \u201d Kayser 's 1946 Ein harmonikaler Teilungskanon had earlier used the term canon in this context . Typographers and book designers apply these principles to this day , with variations related to the availability of standardized paper sizes , and the diverse types of commercially printed books . = = Van de Graaf canon = = The Van de Graaf canon is a historical reconstruction of a method that may have been used in book design to divide a page in pleasing proportions . This canon is also known as the \" secret canon \" used in many medieval manuscripts and incunabula . The geometrical solution of the construction of Van de Graaf 's canon , which works for any page width : height ratio , enables the book designer to position the text body in a specific area of the page . Using the canon , the proportions are maintained while creating pleasing and functional margins of size 1 / 9 and 2 / 9 of the page size . The resulting inside margin is one-half of the outside margin , and of proportions 2 : 3 : 4 : 6 ( inner : top : outer : bottom ) when the page proportion is 2 : 3 ( more generally 1 : R : 2 : 2R for page proportion 1 : R ) . This method was discovered by Van de Graaf , and used by Tschichold and other contemporary designers ; they speculate that it may be older . The page proportions vary , but most commonly used is the 2 : 3 proportion . Tschichold writes \" For purposes of better comparison I have based his figure on a page proportion of 2 : 3 , which Van de Graaf does not use . \" In this canon the text area and page size are of same proportions , and the height of the text area equals the page width . This canon was popularized by Jan Tschichold in his book The Form of the Book . Robert Bringhurst , in his The Elements of Typographic Style , asserts that the proportions that are useful for the shapes of pages are equally useful in shaping and positioning the textblock . This was often the case in medieval books , although later on in the Renaissance , typographers preferred to apply a more polyphonic page in which the proportions of page and textblock would differ . = = Golden canon = = Tschichold 's \" golden canon of page construction \" is based on simple integer ratios , equivalent to Rosarivo 's \" typographical divine proportion . \" = = = Interpretation of Rosarivo = = = Ra\u00fal Rosarivo analyzed Renaissance books with the help of a drafting compass and a ruler , and concluded in his Divina proporci\u00f3n tipogr\u00e1fica ( \" Typographical Divine Proportion \" , first published in 1947 ) that Gutenberg , Peter Sch\u00f6ffer , Nicolaus Jenson and others had applied the golden canon of page construction in their works . According to Rosarivo , his work and assertion that Gutenberg used the \" golden number \" 2 : 3 , or \" secret number \" as he called it , to establish the harmonic relationships between the diverse parts of a work , was analyzed by experts at the Gutenberg Museum and re-published in the Gutenberg-Jahrbuch , its official magazine . Ros Vicente points out that Rosarivo \" demonstrates that Gutenberg had a module different from the well-known one of Luca Pacioli \" ( the golden ratio ) . Tschichold also interprets Rosarivo 's golden number as 2 : 3 , saying : In figure 5 the height of the type area equals the width of the page : using a page proportion of 2 : 3 , a condition for this canon , we get one-ninth of the paper width for the inner margin , two-ninths for the outer or fore-edge margin , one-ninth of the paper height for the top , and two-ninths for the bottom margin . Type area and paper size are of equal proportions . ... What I uncovered as the canon of the manuscript writers , Raul Rosarivo proved to have been Gutenberg 's canon as well . He finds the size and position of the type area by dividing the page diagonal into ninths . The figures he refers to are reproduced in combination here . = = = John Man 's interpretation of Gutenberg = = = Historian John Man suggests that Gutenberg 's Bible page was based on the golden ratio ( commonly approximated as the decimal 0.618 or the ratio 5 : 8 ) , and that the printed area also had that shape . He quotes the dimensions of Gutenberg 's half-folio Bible page as 30.7 x 44.5 cm , a ratio of 1 : 1.45 , close to Rosarivo 's golden 2 : 3 ( 1.5 ) but not to the golden ratio 1.618 . = = = Tschichold and the golden section = = = Building on Rosarivo 's work , contemporary experts in book design such as Jan Tschichold and Richard Hendel assert as well that the page proportion of the golden section ( 21 : 34 ) has been used in book design , in manuscripts , and incunabula , mostly in those produced between 1550 and 1770 . Hendel writes that since Gutenberg 's time , books have been most often printed in an upright position , that conform loosely , if not precisely , to the golden ratio . These page proportions based on the golden section or golden ratio , are usually described through its convergents such as 2 : 3 , 5 : 8 , and 21 : 34 . Tschichold says that common ratios for page proportion used in book design include as 2 : 3 , 1 : \u221a 3 , and the golden section . The image with circular arcs depicts the proportions in a medieval manuscript , that according to Tschichold feature a \" Page proportion 2 : 3 . Margin proportions 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 . Text area in accord with the Golden Section . The lower outer corner of the text area is fixed by a diagonal as well . \" By accord with the golden section , he does not mean exactly equal to , which would conflict with the stated proportions . Tschichold refers to a construction equivalent to van de Graaf 's or Rosarivo 's with a 2 : 3 page ratio as \" the Golden Canon of book page construction as it was used during late Gothic times by the finest of scribes . \" For the canon with the arc construction , which yields a text area ratio closer to the golden ratio , he says \" I abstracted from manuscripts that are older yet . While beautiful , it would hardly be useful today . \" Of the different page proportions that such a canon can be applied to , he says \" Book pages come in many proportions , i.e. , relationships between width and height . Everybody knows , at least from hearsay , the proportion of the Golden Section , exactly 1 : 1.618 . A ratio of 5 : 8 is no more than an approximation of the Golden Section . It would be difficult to maintain the same opinion about a ratio of 2 : 3 . \" Tschichold also expresses a preference for certain ratios over others : \" The geometrically definable irrational page proportions like 1 : 1.618 ( Golden Section ) , 1 : \u221a 2 , 1 : \u221a 3 , 1 : \u221a 5 , 1 : 1.538 , and the simple rational proportions of 1 : 2 , 2 : 3 , 5 : 8 and 5 : 9 I call clear , intentional and definite . All others are unclear and accidental ratios . The difference between a clear and an unclear ratio , though frequently slight , is noticeable . ... Many books show none of the clear proportions , but accidental ones . \" John Man 's quoted Gutenberg page sizes are in a proportion not very close to the golden ratio , but Rosarivo 's or van de Graaf 's construction is applied by Tschichold to make a pleasing text area on pages of arbitrary proportions , even such accidental ones . = = Current applications = = Richard Hendel , associate director of the University of North Carolina Press , describes book design as a craft with its own traditions and a relatively small body of accepted rules . The dust cover of his book , On Book Design , features the Van de Graaf canon . Christopher Burke , in his book on German typographer Paul Renner , creator of the Futura typeface , described his views about page proportions : Renner still championed the traditional proportions of margins , with the largest at the bottom of a page , ' because we hold the book by the lower margin when we take it in the hand and read it ' . This indicates that he envisioned a small book , perhaps a novel , as his imagined model . Yet he struck a pragmatic note by adding that the traditional rule for margin proportions cannot be followed as a doctrine : for example , wide margins for pocket books would be counter-productive . Similarly , he refuted the notion that the type area must have the same proportions as the page : he preferred to trust visual judgment in assessing the placement of the type area on the page , instead of following a pre-determined doctrine . Bringhurst describes a book page as a tangible proportion , which together with the textblock produce an antiphonal geometry , which has the capability to bind the reader to the book , or conversely put the reader 's nerve on edge or drive the reader away .",

It chronicles the recruitment , glory years , notorious time-out fiasco , cultural impact and the scandal that followed these players who are described as iconic figures in the media . The film originally aired on March 13 , 2011 on a national broadcast on ESPN . On its original airing , the film drew 2.7 million viewers , setting a record as the highest-rated ESPN documentary ever . The film spawned critical commentary in a broad spectrum of media outlets which include leading newspapers such as The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post ; leading periodicals such as Forbes ; online forums such as Slate ; and leading news outlets such as MSNBC . In particular , the film sparked a verbal war between Jalen Rose and Duke University 's Grant Hill through the media regarding issues of race in sports and education that fueled the Duke \u2013 Michigan basketball rivalry . Coincidentally , the following week , the 2011 editions of Michigan and Duke met in the third round of the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament ; Duke won , 73-71 . = = Story = = Previously Mitch Albom had chronicled the Fab Five in a book entitled Fab Five : Basketball , Trash Talk , The American Dream , and Fox Sports had attempted to review the group . The press regarded this as the first complete recounting of the fabled group . Rose describes this film as \" almost like the Bible of the Fab Five Story \" . An ESPN commentator describes the five players as the greatest incoming college basketball recruiting class ever . He notes that they were presented to the world as the embodiment of what was wrong with college sports because they wore revolutionary baggy shorts and black socks and blasted hip-hop music while talking a lot of trash . The film documents the \" formation , rise , scandal and epilogue of the team \" . It documents the 1991 \u2013 92 and 1992 \u2013 93 teams , the University of Michigan basketball scandal , and related off the court issues such as hate mail . Forbes notes that the legacy of the quintet , which includes successive appearances in the championship game of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship , was overshadowed by the scandal , which necessitated the removal of Final Four banners and vacating of games . The film is noted for presenting the inside story a group of players who the contemporary media derided as thugs and villains , while enterprise rode them as a multimillion-dollar merchandising juggernaut . The film chronicles a group of athletes who influenced a nation of basketball fans \u2013 some of whom became professional basketball players . It includes commentaries from former Michigan coaches Steve Fisher , Brian Dutcher , and Perry Watson , and rap icons Ice Cube and Chuck D. It also extends to details such as : \" Howard discussing his grandmother 's death the day he signed his letter of intent , to Ray Jackson talking about being ' the fifth wheel ' and considering a transfer , to Jimmy King 's brutal honesty about his disdain for Christian Laettner -- in somewhat unpalatable verbiage , to Rose talking about the loitering ticket he got in the Detroit ' crack house . ' \" The film also presented numerous other highlights of the era as well as some from the high school days of the featured players . Webber was considered notable for his non-involvement in the production , while the rest of the Fab Five were credited as executive producers . Rose approached ESPN Films about the project and brought the other players into the fold . His production role came through his own company , Three Tier Entertainment . The film was directed by Jason Hehir and narrated by Taye Diggs . At first , only three of the freshmen started . Although they all played when the season opened on December 2 , 1991 against the University of Detroit , they did not all play at the same time until December 7 against Eastern Michigan and did not start regularly until February 9 , 1992 . In that first game starting together as a regular unit , the five freshmen accounted for all the team 's points in a 74 \u2013 65 victory against Notre Dame . The film presented the opinions of upperclassmen Eric Riley and James Voskuil when they were replaced by freshmen in the starting lineup . Both fought off impulses to transfer . The four members of the Fab Five who participated in the film have had a tense relationship with Chris Webber , the one player who was not in the film . There was speculation that Chris Webber did not participate to avoid questions about the timeout call in the 1993 NCAA tournament title game . Webber said he initially agreed to be in the documentary but backed out after being told shooting would wrap up in a week , giving him insufficient time to prepare . Jimmy King called that assertion \u201c a flat-out lie . \u201d = = Ratings = = ESPN built up the film with nearly a month of previews and promos . The week before the initial broadcast , ESPN aired clips of the film during some of its other programming ; they featured the team 's feelings about Duke prior to the 1992 championship game . These clips started what would become a national controversy . The film 's initial airing established a record as the ratings leader among all ESPN documentaries with a 2.1 rating according to Nielsen Company , surpassing two of the 30 for 30 films , each of which posted a 1.8 rating : Pony Exce $ $ ( aired December 11 , 2010 , focusing on SMU football of the 1980s , a decade that culminated in scandal ) and The U ( aired December 12 , 2009 , detailing the University of Miami football team in the 1980s and 1990s ) . The Fab Five aired at 9 p.m. ET , drawing an average of 2,088,000 households and 2,746,000 viewers , both bests among ESPN documentaries ; it surpassed the previous high marks set by Pony Exce $ $ , when it was seen by an average of 1,843,000 homes and 2,517,000 viewers on ESPN . The Fab Five was rebroadcast at 11 p.m. on ESPN2 . In excess of 11 million people watched part of the movie on one of the two original national broadcasts on the day of the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament selections . The Fab Five also garnered high TV ratings during their playing days ; they were one of the featured teams in both of the two highest rated NCAA Men 's Basketball Championship games ever played in terms of households ( although not viewers ) , The film aired almost precisely twenty years after the legendary group was assembled . In an attempt to meet the same college basketball fan viewer interest on the tournament selection weekend , HBO produced its own hour-long documentary titled Runnin \u2019 Rebels of UNLV on Jerry Tarkanian and the UNLV Runnin ' Rebels basketball teams of the 1972 \u2013 92 era . Fox Sports also aired an hour-long special featuring sports agent Rob Pelinka , a Michigan teammate of the Fab Five , called Pelinka Chips In on March 14 , but the special had low ratings . Pelinka had a cameo in the Fab Five film . \u22c5 = = Critical review = = The New York Times described the film as a \" flashback to a time when baggy basketball shorts , hip-hop music and black shoes were considered controversial and an affront to hoops purists \" . Washington Post columnist Jason Reid noted that the film went out of its way to present the inappropriate racial commentary by Jalen Rose when he described Duke basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski 's recruits as Uncle Toms . Among those critical of the racial commentary was Duke player Grant Hill , who was cited in an Associated Press story that ran in major national media outlets . Hill blogged on The New York Times with a response naming a litany of Dukies castigated by Rose 's general aspersions . His response was at the top of The New York Times ' \" most-emailed list \" for several days and was shared on Facebook by nearly 100,000 people within its first few days . King responded to Hill in The Wall Street Journal . In the midst of the media exchange , the 2011 editions of the teams advanced to meet on March 20 at 2011 NCAA Tournament West Regional in Charlotte , North Carolina , at the Time Warner Cable Arena with Duke ranked as a # 1 seed and Michigan as an # 8 seed . Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski did not respond until after both teams were eliminated from the tournament , but he noted that he felt the statements were insulting and gave specific reasons why each of the Fab Five members did not go to Duke . Duke player and Michigan native Shane Battier supported Hill 's statements saying , \" Maya Angelou couldn \u2019 t have written it and expressed it better . \" The Detroit Free Press ' Mark Snyder regarded The Fab Five as a \" Warts and all \" depiction . He went on to describe it as a \" . . .a tour de force of information from coaches . . .to the scorned upperclassmen . . . , then-Free Press beat writer Greg Stoda and the Detroit News ' Bryan Burwell , and even rappers Ice Cube and Chuck D reflecting on the style elements . . . \" The article concluded by summarizing the film as \" riveting , brutal in its honesty , realistic in its language and stunning in its archival footage \" . One reviewer , however , felt that the reserves were a bit overlooked . A Michigan writer from The Grand Rapids Press described the film as \" youthful nostalgia that must be felt by a whole generation \" , but noted that the film was lacking in terms of outside perspective . He noted that fans would have welcomed voices of Bobby Knight , Dick Vitale , Jimmy Jackson , or Christian Laettner . He also noted the absence of Webber 's voice as leaving the film with a hole . However , he noted that as much as the Fab Five revolutionized basketball in the American culture , this film remade the image of the Fab Five . Nonetheless , some questioned why Webber declined to participate and speculate on various reasons . Another Michigan writer from SB Nation described the film as thorough in its ability to provide the viewer with the answers to natural intrigues such as : \" How was the recruiting class assembled ? Who pushed for the baggy shorts ? The black socks ? How did a stodgy University of Michigan culture react to this bold , brash and outspoken team ? \" Other columnists were also satisfied to learn that Rose came up with the shorts and Jackson came up with the socks . He also commended the film on its detail surrounding Chris Webber 's infamous timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship . The same reviewer enumerated his five biggest omissions from the film : Michigan athletic director Bill Martin , 1991 \u2013 92 Duke Blue Devils men 's basketball team , 1992 \u2013 93 North Carolina Tar Heels men 's basketball team , Michael Talley and Webber . He was also critical of Mitch Albom 's involvement with the Fab Five . Rivals.com spoke against the tone of the film , which shows a lack of respect for team values . However , in describing the payment scandal , Webber 's related legal problems and the removal of the Fab Five 's banners from Crisler Arena , and the infamous timeout gaffe at the end of the 1993 national championship game at the 1993 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament the documentary was considered fearless . Another controversy arose from the film when the Illinois Fighting Illini men 's basketball teams of the late 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo claimed to be the originators of baggy shorts in basketball . All of the Wolverines who took part in the production of the film described how they felt they originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose 's request . Even rapper Ice Cube described his recollection of them as the originators .",

I bought them to use on my new ceramic cook ware and they are GREAT! They do not scratch my cook ware, stove top or anything else. I'm not a fan of sponges, but I really like these. I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks. Normally, I'd have thrown it away by now, but, again, no odors and whatever I clean up comes right out of the sponge. I do use a liquid cleaner on these after use. I'd recommend these."

He stands 6 feet 3 inches ( 1.91 m ) tall and weighs 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) . He bats and throws left-handed . Previously , he has played for the San Francisco Giants , the Milwaukee Brewers , the Baltimore Orioles , and the New York Yankees . Ishikawa has also filled in as an outfielder at times in his career . Ishikawa grew up in Washington State . He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft by the San Francisco Giants out of high school . He made his Major League debut with the Giants in 2006 , but it was not until 2009 that he made it to the major leagues full-time . He started 2009 as the Giants ' first baseman but failed to produce offensively and was replaced part of the season by Ryan Garko . However , on defense he was third in the National League ( NL ) in fielding percentage . In 2010 , he served as a pinch-hitter and defensive replacement for the Giants and won a World Series ring as the Giants won the 2010 World Series . Ishikawa was designated for assignment at the end of spring training in 2011 and spent the entire season in the minor leagues . In 2012 , Ishikawa signed with the Milwaukee Brewers , who used him mainly as a pinch-hitter and defensive replacement .

Rixey was best known as the National League 's leader in career victories for a left-hander with 266 wins until Warren Spahn surpassed his total in 1959 . Rixey attended the University of Virginia where he was a star pitcher . He was discovered by umpire Cy Rigler , who convinced him to sign directly with the Phillies , bypassing minor league baseball entirely . His time with the Phillies was marked by inconsistency . He won 22 games in 1916 , but also led the league in losses twice . In 1915 , the Phillies played in the World Series , and Rixey lost in his only appearance . After being traded to the Reds prior to the 1921 season , he won 20 or more games in a season three times , including a league-leading 25 in 1922 , and posted eight consecutive winning seasons . His skills were declining by the 1929 season , when his record was 10 \u2013 13 with a 4.16 earned run average . He pitched another four seasons before retiring after the 1933 season . An intellectual who taught high school Latin during the off-season , earning the nickname \" Jephtha \" for his southern drawl , Rixey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963 but died a month after his election . = = Early life = = Rixey was born on May 3 , 1891 in Culpeper , Virginia , and at the age of ten , his father , a banker , moved his family to Charlottesville , Virginia . His uncles were John Franklin Rixey a former congressman and Presley Marion Rixey the former Surgeon General of the United States Navy . He attended the University of Virginia , where he played basketball and baseball ; he was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity . His brother Bill also played baseball for Virginia . During the off-season , umpire Cy Rigler worked as an assistant coach for the University . He recognized Rixey 's talent and tried to sign him to the Philadelphia Phillies . Rixey originally declined , saying he wanted to be a chemist , but Rigler insisted , even offering a substantial portion of the bonus he received for signing a player . With his family in financial trouble , Rixey accepted the deal . The National League , upon hearing of the deal , created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players . Neither Rixey nor Rigler received any signing bonus . = = Baseball career = = = = = Philadelphia Phillies = = = Rixey joined the Phillies for the 1912 season without playing a single game of minor league baseball . His time with the Phillies was marked by inconsistency . He went 10-10 in his first year , with a 2.50 earned run average ( ERA ) and 10 complete games in 23 games pitched . He had a three hit shutout against the Chicago Cubs on July 18 . Rixey was on the losing end of a no-hitter by Jeff Tesreau on September 6 . After the season , the Chicago Cubs , under new manager Johnny Evers , offered a \" huge sum \" to the Phillies for Rixey , but manager Red Dooin declined the offer . Prior to the 1913 season , Rixey notified the Phillies of his desire to finish his studies at the University of Virginia and graduate in June ; however , after some negotiation , he decided to sign a contract and re-joined the team shortly after the season began . That season , he appeared in 35 games , started 19 of them , winning nine games , and had a 3.12 earned run average . In 1914 , his record worsened to 2 \u2013 11 , and his earned run average increased to 4.37 .

On June 29 , Rixey pitched a four-hit shutout against the New York Giants , facing the minimum 27 batters , because of three double plays , and a player caught stealing . In 1917 , despite having a 2.27 earned run average , Rixey led the league in pitching losses with 21 . He also handled 108 chances without a single error . Rixey hated losing and was known for destroying the team locker room , or disappearing for days at a time after a loss . He missed the 1918 season to serve in the Chemical Warfare Division of the United States army during the war effort . He struggled upon returning to baseball , going 6 \u2013 12 with a 3.97 earned run average in 1919 , and again leading the league in losses with 22 in 1920 . Prior to the 1920 season , rumours circulated that his former manager , Pat Moran , now with the Cincinnati Reds , was interested in trading for Rixey . The relationship between Rixey and manager Gavvy Cravath was never good , and Cravath had made known his desire to trade him ; however , he stayed with the Phillies that season , working on his delivery with former pitcher Jesse Tannehill , who , Rixey admitted , helped with his pitching delivery . On November 22 , 1920 , Rixey was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Jimmy Ring and Greasy Neale . His record during his eight seasons with the Phillies was 87 wins and 103 losses . = = = Cincinnati Reds = = = Rixey was traded to the Reds prior to the 1921 season for Jimmy Ring and Greasy Neale .

Rixey 's production began to decline in 1930 , when he went 9 \u2013 13 with a 5.10 ERA , and pitched fewer than 200 innings for the first time since 1919 . From 1931 through 1933 , Rixey pitched very little , and was used almost exclusively against the Pittsburgh Pirates . For the 1933 season , he was the only Reds pitcher with a winning record , at 6-3 as the Reds finished last in the National League with a 58-94 record . He retired prior to the 1934 season , stating \" the manager wasn 't giving me enough work \" . Rixey completed his career with 266 wins , 251 losses , and a 3.15 ERA . He appeared in 692 games and completed 290 , and had 20 wins and 14 saves as a relief pitcher . Bubbles Hargrave , former Cincinnati catcher , gave this testimonial : \" Eppa was just great . He was great as a pitcher , fielder and competitor . I look on him as the most outstanding player I came in contact with in my entire career . \" Rixey 's approach to the game is exemplified by the following quote : \" \" How dumb can the hitters in this league get ? I 've been doing this for fifteen years . When they 're batting with the count two balls and no strikes , or three and one , they 're always looking for the fastball and they never get it . \" \u2013 Eppa Rixey ( 1927 ) = = Legacy = = Originally Rixey had trouble controlling his speed , but eventually became one of the most feared pitchers in baseball according to reporters . Rixey was considered a pitcher with an \" peculiar motion \" , who rarely walked a batter . Throughout his long career , the 210-pound Rixey charmed teammates and fans with his dry wit and big Southern drawl . His nonsensical nickname \" Jephtha \" seemed to capture his roots and amiable personality . Some writers thought \" Jephtha \" was a part of Rixey 's real name , but it was likely invented by a Philadelphia sportswriter . Rob Neyer called Rixey the fourth best pitcher in Reds history behind Bucky Walters , Paul Derringer and teammate Dolf Luque . His 266 career victories was the record for most wins by a left-handed pitcher in the National League until Warren Spahn broke it in 1959 , however his 251 losses are an all-time record for left-handed pitchers . He also held the longevity record for most seasons pitched by a National League left-hander until Steve Carlton broke it in 1986 . As time passed , support for Rixey to be inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame grew . He was also inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1958 . In 1960 , Rixey finished third in the balloting behind former teammate Edd Roush and Sam Rice ( who was later inducted the same year as Rixey ) . Upon his election to the Hall of Fame on January 27 , 1963 , he was quoted as saying \" They 're really scraping the bottom of the barrel , aren 't they ? \" In 1969 , he was named by Reds fans as the greatest left-handed pitcher in Reds history . The Reds Hall of Fame summed up his career : \" He was the best left-hander ever to pitch for the Reds with a 179 \u2013 148 record , 180 complete games , 23 shutouts and a 3.33 ERA in his 13 seasons . \" In 1972 he was inducted into the first class of the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum . Rixey 's childhood home in Culpeper still stands ; it suffered some damage in the 2011 Virginia earthquake . = = Personal life = = He was married to Dorothy Meyers of Cincinnati and had two children , Eppa Rixey III and Ann Rixey Sikes and five grandchildren , James Rixey , Eppa Rixey IV , Steve Sikes , Paige Sikes , and David Sikes . After his retirement from baseball , worked for his father-in-law 's successful insurance company in Cincinnati , eventually becoming president of the company . He died of a heart attack on February 28 , 1963 , one month after his election to the Hall of Fame , becoming the first player to die between election and induction to the Hall of Fame . He is interred at Greenlawn Cemetery in Milford , Ohio . When Rixey started playing , he was considered an \" anomaly \" . He came from a well-off family and was college-educated , something that was rare during his era . He wrote poetry , and took graduate school classes in chemistry , mathematics and Latin . During the off-season , he was a Latin teacher at Episcopal High School in Alexandria , Virginia . He was also considered among the best golfers among athletes during the time period . He was the subject of hazing in his first few years in the Majors . Eventually he teamed up with other college graduates , Joe Oeschger and Stan Baumgartner and the hazing lessened to a degree .",

Bautista throws three pitches : a fastball , a curveball , and a changeup . He has struggled with control throughout his career . Bautista grew up receiving instruction on pitching from his second cousin , Pedro Mart\u00ednez . The Florida Marlins signed him in 2000 but traded him to the Baltimore Orioles before Bautista reached the major leagues . He debuted with the Orioles in 2004 , appearing in two games before getting traded to the Kansas City Royals . Bautista was ranked Kansas City 's number two prospect by Baseball America entering the 2005 season , but he made just seven starts before missing the rest of the season with an injury . He posted a 5.66 earned run average ( ERA ) for the Royals in 2006 before getting traded to the Colorado Rockies . He appeared in nine games ( all in relief ) for the Rockies in 2007 , spending most of the year in the minor leagues . After 2007 , Bautista never made another start in the major leagues .

                "Justin De Fratus = Justin Andrew De Fratus ( born October 21 , 1987 ) is an American professional baseball relief pitcher in the Washington Nationals organization . De Fratus grew up in Oxnard , California and played baseball in high school prior to playing at Ventura College . The Philadelphia Phillies selected him in the 11th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft . He methodically moved his way up through the Phillies system , spending about one year at each level from rookie to Class A , and then moving through two levels per season in 2010 and 2011 . In 2011 , De Fratus made his MLB debut and , by 2013 , he was a regular member of the Phillies bullpen after a few years of splitting time between the major leagues and Triple-A. In 2014 , he used his slider to \" dominate the league \" , and establish himself as a reliable reliever capable of pitching in late-inning situations . De Fratus has a two-pitch repertoire that consists of a fastball and a slider , the latter of which is his out pitch . He embraces a propensity to work quickly on the mound , and use a lower arm slot . Off the field , De Fratus is a member of the Roman Catholic church , and uses baseball to strengthen his faith . He sees evangelism as a duty of Christians , and would like to go to seminary when he finishes his baseball career . = = Early life = = De Fratus attended Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard , California , from which he graduated in 2005 ; he was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers . His high school coach , David Soliz , asserted that he could pitch in the major leagues for a long time , saying , \" He definitely has the stuff to pitch in the majors . Justin has the stuff , but he also has the confidence . The odds were against him being drafted in the 11th round out of Ventura College . \" De Fratus was the first Rio Mesa player to reach the majors during Soliz 's tenure . He went on to attend Ventura College where , like at Rio Mesa , he was a starting pitcher . = = Professional career = = = = = Minor leagues = = = The Phillies selected De Fratus with the 353rd overall pick in the 11th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft , and assigned him to the Gulf Coast League Phillies , the Phillies ' rookie level minor league affiliate , with whom he went 2 \u2013 3 with a 4.30 earned run average ( ERA ) in 10 games ( eight starts ) . The next season , 2008 , he advanced to the Williamsport Crosscutters , and went 6 \u2013 5 with a 3.67 ERA in 14 starts . He led the New York \u2013 Penn League in innings pitched , pitching at least six in almost 65 % of his starts ; the Phillies named him their minor league player of the week in mid-June . Before the 2009 season , at the decision of Phillies minor league pitching coordinator Gorman Heimueller and assistant general manager Chuck LaMar , De Fratus became predominantly a relief pitcher so he was \" not sitting down four games out of the week \" and could be a more focused pitcher . He took his first crack at relief pitching with the Lakewood Blue Claws , and ultimately began to flourish , earning Phillies minor league player of the week honors , and a spot in the South Atlantic League all-star game . On the season , he posted a 5 \u2013 6 record with a 3.19 ERA in 36 games ( though still with 12 starts ) . After the season , he participated in the Florida Instructional League . He had a successful 2010 season , splitting time between the High-A Clearwater Threshers and Double-A Reading Phillies , and posting a 1.94 ERA with 21 saves in 49 games . = = = Major leagues = = = = = = = Philadelphia Phillies = = = = De Fratus began the 2011 season with Double-A Reading , and was promoted to Triple-A Lehigh Valley on June 16 after much success in Reading . He recorded seven saves with Lehigh Valley , and was named the Phillies minor league player of the week in late August , before making his MLB debut with the Philadelphia Phillies on September 18 , 2011 , after joining the team as a September callup . During his debut , an opposing batter fouled a ball off , and De Fratus 's brother caught the ball . Ultimately , it was a scoreless debut , and he went on to pitch four more big-league games that season . At the end of the season , Baseball America rated him the seventh-best prospect in the Phillies ' minor league system . Before 2012 , like in 2011 , he was given an opportunity to open the season in the Phillies bullpen , but ended up injuring his shoulder , and missing much of the season . He called the injury a \" beat down \" both physically and mentally , but he returned and pitched with the big-league club in September . At the conclusion of the season , he was mentally exhausted and used golf to help \" divert \" his attention from baseball , playing over 50 rounds in the offseason ; he credited golf with helping him overcome the mental exhaustion he faced after the season , and entered 2013 in a relaxed frame of mind . By 2013 , De Fratus was a regular member of the bullpen , pitching in 58 games with the big-league club ; he performed well enough to be considered likely to open the 2014 season firmly implanted in the Phillies bullpen . He broke spring training 2014 with the major league team , but after four appearances , he was optioned back to the minor leagues to work on commanding his pitches , notwithstanding the Phillies ' dearth of other right-handed relieving options . While at Lehigh Valley , he spent a significant amount of time reviewing film from his outings in 2011 and 2012 , from which he learned that he had a faster pace when pitching , a more aggressive pitching style , and a lower arm slot . Just under a month later , in late May , he was recalled to the major league team , and had much success ( 11 consecutive scoreless appearances ) as part of a Phillies ' bullpen that drastically improved from the beginning of the season , and , statistically , was among the best in the major leagues in early June . De Fratus ' drastically improved command helped him halve his career walk rate \u2013 he walked just 5.5 % of batters he faced in 2014 , which contributed to a \" breakout \" season . Although he was overshadowed by the emergence of fellow relief pitcher Ken Giles , De Fratus established himself as a reliable late-innings reliever for the future . = = = = Seattle Mariners = = = = A free agent following the 2015 season , De Fratus signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 2 . He was released on March 16 , 2016 , and re-signed to a minor league contract the following day . = = = = Texas Rangers = = = = On June 11 , 2016 , De Fratus was traded to the Texas Rangers . = = Pitching style = = A fastball and a slider comprise De Fratus 's pitching repertoire ; his fastball averages about 93 miles per hour ( 150 km / h ) , but occasionally touches 95 miles per hour ( 153 km / h ) , while his slider is about 10 miles per hour ( 16 km / h ) slower than that . His slider was able to \" dominate the league \" in 2014 , and although he does not total as many strikeouts as some relievers , he has established himself as a dependable piece in the Phillies ' bullpen . Early in his career , De Fratus aspired to be a closer , but after realizing that an \" all-or-nothing \" mentality was not necessarily conducive to success , he sought to relax more and focus on being a quality setup reliever , projecting confidence on the mound . Especially in the Phillies ' young bullpen , the need for reliable late-innings relievers was great , underscoring the importance of De Fratus 's emergence . He is most successful when he utilizes a lower arm angle , and works quickly on the mound . = = Personal life = = De Fratus is a devout Roman Catholic who , though he was raised in a large Catholic family , struggled with his faith after an injury early in his career , but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith : \" I really feel that the setback was God telling me , \u2018 Hey you are not done . You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out , and I am going to give you a little more time . \u2019 There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have . \" He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others . Early in his professional career , he struggled to find fellow Catholics , and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious . Moreover , in many small towns that house minor league teams , there are no Catholic churches , so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle . However , upon realizing that there is more to life than material success , he discovered a need for God , and has thus developed his faith . Aside from his faith , he enjoys writing and recording music , and playing the guitar . He has two brothers , the older of whom , Steve , played in the minor leagues , and the younger of whom , Chris , caught a foul ball during De Fratus 's major league debut . During the offseason preceding the 2015 season , De Fratus became involved in some controversy involving Phillies blogger Bill Baer and the Black Lives Matter campaign when he tweeted , \" I 'm sick of this black vs white and men vs women garbage that 's been going on . We 're just people . # AllLivesMatter , \" to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley , a blog affiliated with ESPN , in which he stated that De Fratus is \" complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn \u2019 t have the luxury of being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area . \" Subsequently , De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook , in which he commented , \" I sincerely hope that you will take the time to talk to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me , my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters . I do not apologize for anything I have said . I have a platform and I WILL use it for the agenda of love . \"",

He has played for the Royals since making his MLB debut on May 6 , 2011 . A highly touted prospect coming out of American Heritage High School in Florida , Hosmer was described as a \" left-handed hitter with raw power \" by scouts . He was drafted as the third overall pick in the 2008 MLB draft where he received a $ 6 million signing bonus . He advanced relatively quickly in minor league baseball , before debuting in MLB . He finished third in the Rookie of the Year ballot for the 2011 season after hitting .293 with 19 home runs in 128 games . He was the MVP of the 2016 MLB All-Star game . = = Early life = = Hosmer 's father , Mike , is a retired firefighter , and his mother , Ileana , is a nurse . His mother was born in Cuba and came to the United States at the age of seven with her family to escape Fidel Castro 's regime , growing up in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . His parents met in 1979 when Mike was assigned to duty at Coral Gables Hospital in Coral Gables , Florida , where Illeana worked . They married four years later . Their first son Mike Jr. was born in 1985 , and Eric was born four years later in Miami . Growing up in Cooper City , Hosmer credited his family for helping him succeed as a baseball player . He began playing baseball at an early age , using a Tony Gwynn teeball hitter to take practice swings . His father volunteered to do 48-hour shifts in a firehouse in Liberty City , a tough neighborhood in Miami , to focus on his son 's baseball games which he usually coached . The Hosmers traveled all over the state , and as far as Cooperstown , New York , home of the Baseball Hall of Fame , to play in baseball tournaments . At home , Hosmer watched Florida Marlins games to study the hitting techniques of the team players in order to improve his skills . His father helped him with batting practice after finishing long shifts at work , while his mother helped with his homework and taped every baseball game to evaluate Hosmer 's baseball ability and further hone his skills . By the time Hosmer reached high school , he worked out \" close to seven hours a day \" and mainly ate protein , which helped form his muscular build . Hosmer 's family hired Bladimir Marrero , a highly regarded hitting instructor and the father of Washington Nationals first baseman Chris Marrero , to help with their son 's skills . His brother Mike also played baseball , receiving a scholarship to Florida State University . He was never interested in becoming a professional baseball player , however , and currently is a stock broker in Miami . = = High school career = = By the time Hosmer was a teenager , he was a member of several Little League baseball squads that won a couple of state championships . He attended American Heritage School in Plantation , Florida . His parents selected American Heritage because of their rich baseball program , which was considered to be one of the best in the United States , despite the expensive tuition . By Hosmer 's sophomore year , he grew eight inches in size , becoming a powerful prep prospect . In his senior year , Hosmer hit .470 with 11 home runs , as the team was in the top 10 in USA Today 's Super 25 rankings for most of the year and won a state championship . He attracted twenty or more MLB and college scouts who evaluated Hosmer 's every move . Several of his amateur home runs had popularity in YouTube , which caught the attention of sports agent Scott Boras . He received many achievements while in high school including being named as Florida 's Baseball Player of the Year twice by the Miami Herald , a member of the Rawlings High School Gold Glove team , and the American Amateur Baseball Congress Connie Mack MVP award . Hosmer was offered a baseball scholarship to Arizona State University . Hosmer planned to attend Arizona State if negotiations with an MLB team did not go through . He was named as one of the top five prep baseball players in the country by several scouting agencies by the time he graduated in 2008 , including number two by Rivals.com and third by both RISE Magazine and Sports Illustrated . As \" one of high school baseball top power hitters \" by scouts , and a consensus top 10 pick , Hosmer was chosen by the Royals in the first round ( third overall selection ) of the 2008 MLB draft . Hosmer remained unsigned for most of the summer while the Royals general manager Dayton Moore and Boras , operating as Hosmer 's agent , negotiated a deal . During negotiations , Hosmer helped lead his team based in Cincinnati , to a second-place finish at the American Amateur Baseball Congress Connie Mack World Series . Both sides agreed to a contract ten minutes before the signing dateline for drafted players on August 15 , 2008 . He received a six million dollar signing bonus , the largest sum given to a draft pick in Royals history . = = Minor leagues = = Soon after signing his contract , the Royals assigned Hosmer , # 30 at the time , to the Idaho Falls Chukars of the rookie level Pioneer League in minor league baseball . Before reporting to the Chukars , Royals general manager Moore told reporters that Hosmer would not be \" rushed \" to reach the Majors , stating that he needs to advance though the Minor League hierarchy in his \" own natural pace \" . He played a handful of games with the Chukars before a contract dispute with another Boras client , Pittsburgh Pirates second overall pick Pedro Alvarez delayed Hosmer from playing with the team . Boras had claimed that Alvarez signed his contract after the August 15 deadline had passed , thus won 't report to the Pirates . The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance stating that Hosmer 's contract was also signed past the deadline and that Major League Baseball extended the August 15 deadline without the association 's permission . Both sides settled the claim a month later , allowing Hosmer and Alvarez to join their respective teams . Hosmer never disputed his original contract . Instead of heading back to the Chukars , Hosmer was sent to the Arizona Fall League to train . In Hosmer 's first full season in minor league ball , Hosmer was sent to the Burlington Bees in the Midwest League , the Royals ' other rookie league affiliate . At Burlington , Hosmer struggled at the plate . By June 1 , he hit only one home run in 31 games while leading the team in strikeouts . He missed some time with a left pinkie finger injury . At the end of the season , Hosmer hit .241 with six home runs . He later mentioned the 2009 season as \" a tough year \" . In 2010 , Hosmer was named the seventh best first base prospect by Scout.com. He started the season with the Royals ' Class A-Advanced affiliate , the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. where his struggles continued . He was soon diagnosed with astigmatism , an eye condition and had laser surgery to correct the problem . Hosmer returned to the Blue Rocks a week later and his hitting significantly improved . By May 23 he was hitting .388 with a .571 slugging percentage . He played in the 2010 All-Star Futures Game where he had four hits and two RBI in a 9-1 victory . For his effort , Hosmer was promoted to the Northwest Arkansas Naturals of the Class AA Texas League on July 17 , where in his first at-bat he hit a home run . During the playoffs Hosmer hit six home runs , which was individually , the second highest total in a single Texas League playoff series . The team went on to win the Texas League championship . The Royals ' farm system was ranked number one in baseball entering the 2011 season , led by Hosmer and another top prospect , third baseman Mike Moustakas . Most baseball critics agreed that the Royals , a team that was known for mediocrity the past two decades , would be a contender within a couple of years , and they had nine prospects in Baseball America 's top 100 , a record for the publication . Hosmer was ranked as the best first baseman prospect in Major League Baseball prior to the 2011 season . He was also rated the eighth best overall prospect by Baseball America , and the top Royals prospect overall . So much hype was placed on the Royals that general manager Dayton Moore traded the team 's best player , Cy Young Award winner Zack Greinke to the Milwaukee Brewers for four top prospects , to focus on the team 's future . Hosmer began the season with the Royals Class AAA affiliate , the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) . When the Royals purchased Hosmer 's contract on May 5 , 2011 , he was leading the minor leagues with a .439 batting average and the PCL with 43 hits and a .525 on-base percentage . = = MLB career = = The Royals recalled Hosmer on May 5 , 2011 . Veteran catcher Jason Kendall was moved to the 60-day disabled list to make space for Hosmer on the 40-man roster . He made his MLB debut at first base the following day against Oakland Athletics starter Gio Gonzalez , replacing Kila Ka 'aihue . Prior to his debut , Hosmer was being touted by journalists as a \" super-prospect \" and the \" most-hyped \" rookie to debut for the Royals since Bo Jackson . The Royals promoted Hosmer before a mid-June deadline in which the Royals could have avoided salary arbitration for an extra year . Hosmer went hitless in two at-bats , striking out twice . Hosmer also walked twice and stole a base in a 3 \u2013 2 loss as the Royals had the second biggest crowd of the season .

In his first month with the Royals , he hit .283 with five home runs and was named the Royals Player of the Month . His batting average fell 14 points by the end of June , with manager Ned Yost citing \" impatience at the plate \" . He hit a game-winning two-run home run against closer Matt Capps of the Minnesota Twins on July 16 . The home run led the Twins to replace Capps with Joe Nathan as its closer the next day .

He had five hits , including a three-run home run against Brad Penny in a 10 \u2013 2 win against the Detroit Tigers on September 20 .

During spring training , Hosmer led all players with 29 RBIs and had a slugging percentage of .714 . Discussing Hosmer 's spring training , Royals Hall of Famer George Brett said , \" He 's a baseball player ... He acts like a baseball player . And boy , he 's going to be a damn good one , too . \" By opening day , the Kansas City media was hyping Hosmer as the \" face of the franchise \" , the city \" next future sports star \" , among other commentary after his performance last year . He started at first base on opening day against the L.A. Angels , going 0-for-4 . He hit a home run in a 6-3 victory the next day but later struggled , hitting below .200 for the first couple of weeks of the season as the Royals endured an 11-game losing streak entering April 24 . He ended the season with a .232 / .304 / .359 slash line to go along with 14 home runs and 60 RBIs . In 2013 his defense earned him his first Gold Glove award . On July 20 , 2014 , in a game against the Boston Red Sox , Hosmer was hit in the hand by a pitch from Jon Lester . At first , he was only day-to-day with a bruised hand . However , on July 31 , in a game against the Minnesota Twins , he aggravated the injury on a checked swing in the fourth inning . X-rays revealed a displaced fracture of the third finger on his right hand . Hosmer missed four weeks due to the injury . He finished the season batting .270 , 9 home runs and 58 runs batted in .

                "Herb Pennock = Herbert Jefferis Pennock ( February 10 , 1894 \u2013 January 30 , 1948 ) was an American professional baseball pitcher . He played in Major League Baseball from 1912 through 1933 . He is best known for his time spent with the star-studded New York Yankee teams of the mid to late 1920s and early 1930s . Connie Mack signed Pennock to his Philadelphia Athletics in 1912 . After using Pennock sparingly , and questioning his competitive drive , Mack sold Pennock to the Boston Red Sox in 1915 . After returning from military service in 1919 , Pennock became a regular contributor for the Red Sox . The Yankees acquired Pennock from the Red Sox after the 1922 season , and he served as a key member of the pitching staff as the Yankees won four World Series championships during his tenure with the team . After retiring as a player , Pennock served as a coach and farm system director for the Red Sox , and as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies . Pennock was regarded as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in baseball history . Mack later called his sale of Pennock to the Red Sox his greatest mistake . Pennock died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1948 ; later that year , he was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame . = = Early life = = Pennock was born on February 10 , 1894 in Kennett Square , Pennsylvania . His father , Theodore Pennock , and mother Mary Louise Pennock ( n\u00e9e Sharp ) were of Scotch-Irish and Quaker descent . His ancestors came to the United States with William Penn . Herb was the youngest of four children . Pennock attended Westtown School and Cedarcroft Boarding School , where he played for the baseball team . After struggling as a first baseman , with a weak offensive output and throwing arm that resulted in curved throws , his Cedarcroft coach converted Pennock into a pitcher . = = Playing career = = = = = Philadelphia Athletics = = = While pitching at Cedarcroft , Pennock threw a no-hitter to catcher Earle Mack , the son of Connie Mack , manager of the Philadelphia Athletics , in 1910 . Pennock agreed to sign with the Athletics at a later date . Mack signed Pennock in 1912 to play for his collegiate team based in Atlantic City . Pennock 's father insisted that he sign under an alias in order to protect his collegiate eligibility . Pennock threw a no-hitter against a traveling Negro league baseball team , and Mack promoted him to the Athletics . Mack intended for Pennock to be one of the prospects who would replace star pitchers Eddie Plank , Chief Bender , and Jack Coombs . Pennock made his major league debut with the Athletics during the 1912 season on May 14 , allowing one hit in four innings pitched . He was the youngest person to play in the American League ( AL ) that season . Former major leaguer Mike Grady , a neighbor of Pennock 's in Kennett Square , took Pennock under his wing , while Bender taught Pennock to throw a screwball . Pennock missed most of the 1913 season with an illness . In the 1914 season , Pennock posted an 11 \u2013 4 win \u2013 loss record with a 2.79 earned run average ( ERA ) in 151 2 \u2044 3 innings pitched for the Athletics , and pitched three scoreless innings in the 1914 World Series , which the Athletics lost to the Boston Braves . Mack let Bender go after the season , naming Pennock his Opening Day starting pitcher in 1915 . On Opening Day , Pennock threw a one-hit complete game shutout against the Boston Red Sox . However , as the Athletics struggled , Pennock 's nonchalant playing style drew Mack 's ire . Concluding that Pennock \" lacked ambition \" , Mack sold Pennock to the Red Sox for the waiver price of $ 2,500 ( $ 58,479 in current dollar terms ) . Mack later regarded this sale as his greatest mistake . = = = Boston Red Sox = = = With a deep pitching staff in place , the Red Sox loaned Pennock to the Providence Grays of the International League in August for the remainder of the 1915 season . He split the 1916 season between the Red Sox and the Buffalo Bisons , also in the International League . With Buffalo , Pennock pitched to a 1.67 ERA , as Buffalo won the league pennant . Though the Red Sox won the 1915 and 1916 World Series , Pennock did not appear in either series . Pitching in minor league baseball , Pennock began to regain confidence . However , Boston manager Jack Barry used Pennock sparingly in the 1917 season , and Pennock enlisted in the United States Navy in 1918 . Pennock pitched for a team fielded by the Navy , defeating a team composed of members of the United States Army in an exhibition for George VI , the King of England , in Stamford Bridge . After the game , Ed Barrow , the new manager of the Red Sox , signed Pennock to a new contract after promising to use him regularly during the 1919 season . Pennock received only one start apiece in the months of April and May , as the 1919 Red Sox relied on George Dumont , Bill James , and Bullet Joe Bush , leading Pennock to threaten to quit in late-May unless Barrow fulfilled his earlier promise to Pennock . Barrow continued to use Pennock regularly after Memorial Day , and Pennock finished the season with a 16 \u2013 8 win-loss record and a 2.71 ERA in 219 innings pitched . He served as the team 's ace pitcher in the 1920 season , but subsequently settled in as the Red Sox ' third starter . After the 1922 Red Sox campaign , in which he went 10 \u2013 17 , and had seven wild pitches , leading the AL , the New York Yankees began to negotiate with the Red Sox to acquire Pennock . The Yankees traded Norm McMillan , George Murray , and Camp Skinner to the Red Sox for Pennock that offseason . = = = New York Yankees = = = Pennock pitched to a 19 \u2013 6 win-loss record in the 1923 season , his first with the Yankees , leading the American League ( AL ) in winning percentage ( .760 ) and finishing sixth in wins . Pitching in the 1923 World Series , Pennock defeated the New York Giants in game two , on October 11 , to end their eight-game World Series winning streak . He recorded a save in securing the Yankees ' win in game four , and pitched to the win in game six on one day of rest , clinching the Yankees ' first World Series championship . Umpire Billy Evans called it \" the greatest pitching performance I have ever seen \" , as Pennock \" had nothing . \" In the 1924 season , he pitched to a 21 \u2013 9 win-loss record with a 2.83 ERA while striking out a career-high 101 batters . His win total was second in the AL , behind Walter Johnson , while his ERA was third behind Johnson and Tom Zachary , and he finished fourth in strikeouts behind Johnson , Howard Ehmke , and teammate Bob Shawkey . Pennock 's 277 innings pitched and 1.220 walks plus hits per inning pitched ( WHIP ) ratio led the AL in the 1925 season , while his 2.96 ERA was second-best , behind Stan Coveleski . In the 1926 season , he posted a career-high 23 wins , finishing second in the AL to George Uhle . He again led the AL in WHIP ( 1.265 ) , and issued the fewest walks per nine innings pitched ( 1.453 ) . During the pennant race , The Sporting News called Pennock the \" best left-hander in the majors \" . Pennock earned the wins in game one and game five of the 1926 World Series . He finished game seven of the series , which the Yankees lost to the St. Louis Cardinals . The Yankees reached the World Series , facing the Pittsburgh Pirates . Pennock pitched a complete game against the Pirates in game three of the 1927 World Series , not allowing a hit until the eighth inning . Pennock 's performance drew praise from teammate Babe Ruth . The Yankees swept the series from Pittsburgh . After pitching a three-hit shutout against the Red Sox on August 12 , 1928 , he missed the remainder of the season , including the 1928 World Series , with an arm injury . His five shutouts and 0.085 home runs per nine innings pitched led the AL . His 2.56 ERA trailed only Garland Braxton , while his 17 wins tied for eighth place . Though the Yankees defeated the Cardinals in the 1928 World Series , the Yankees ' starting rotation without Pennock was likened to \" a three-stringed ukulele . \" In the 1929 season , Pennock saw his pitching time and pitching quality diminish . Over the rest of his career , he never posted more than 189 innings pitched in a season and his ERA rose to over 4.00 . He suffered from bouts of neuritis in 1929 and 1930 . Pennock won his 200th career game during the 1929 season , becoming the third left-handed pitcher to reach that mark . He led the AL in walks per nine innings pitched in 1930 ( 1.151 ) and 1931 ( 1.426 ) . Pennock pitched four innings of relief against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series , recording two saves . The New York chapter of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America named him their player of the year . In 1933 , serving exclusively as a relief pitcher , Pennock had a 7 \u2013 4 win-loss record in 23 appearances . After the 1933 season , the Yankees honored Pennock with a testimonial dinner on January 6 , 1934 , and then gave him his release . = = = Return to Boston = = = Eddie Collins , a former teammate with the Athletics now serving as the general manager of the Red Sox , signed Pennock to their 1934 roster . In his last season pitching in the major leagues , Pennock served as a relief pitcher for the Red Sox . Pennock retired with a career record of 240 wins , 162 losses , and a 3.60 ERA . Pennock pitched in five World Series , one with Philadelphia and four with New York . He was a member of four World Series championship teams . In World Series play , Pennock amassed a 5 \u2013 0 career win-loss record with three saves , becoming the second pitcher to win five World Series games , after Coombs . Pennock was a part of seven World Series championship teams ( 1913 , 1915 , 1916 , 1923 , 1927 , 1928 , and 1932 ) , though he played in four World Series ' as a member of the winning team . Many , including Mack , consider Pennock among the greatest left-handed pitchers of all time . = = Post-playing career = = Pennock became the general manager of the Charlotte Hornets , a Red Sox ' farm team of the Piedmont League , prior to the 1935 season . He returned to the Red Sox in 1936 , serving as the first base and pitching coach under manager Joe Cronin . He served in this role through the 1938 season . In 1939 , Pennock served as the Assistant Supervisor of Boston 's minor league system , reporting to Evans . Pennock succeeded Evans as Director of Minor League Operations late in the 1940 season . In December 1943 , R. R. M. Carpenter , Jr . , the new owner of the Philadelphia Phillies , hired Pennock as his general manager , after receiving a recommendation from Mack . Carpenter gave Pennock a lifetime contract . Pennock filled Carpenter 's duties when the team 's owner was drafted into service during World War II in 1944 . As general manager , Pennock changed the team 's name to the \" Blue Jays \" , and invested $ 1 million ( $ 13,442,344 in current dollar terms ) into players who would become known as the \" Whiz Kids \" , who won the National League pennant in 1950 , including Curt Simmons and Willie Jones . He also created a \" Grandstand Managers Club \" , the first in baseball history , allowing fans to give feedback to the team , and advocated for the repeal of the Bonus Rule . Pennock opposed racial integration in baseball . In 1947 , when Jackie Robinson was signed to the Brooklyn Dodgers , Pennock called Dodgers team president Branch Rickey before the Dodgers ' series in Philadelphia and told him not to \" bring that nigger here with the rest of the team . \" He further threatened to boycott a 1947 game between the Phillies and Dodgers if Robinson played . In 1948 , at the age of 53 , one week and four days before his 54th birthday , Pennock collapsed in the lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage . He was pronounced dead upon his arrival at Midtown Hospital . Pennock had been healthy , even inviting friends to join him at Madison Square Garden to attend a boxing match . = = Honors = = Pennock was honored with \" Herb Pennock Day \" on April 30 , 1944 in Kennett Square . Weeks after his death , Pennock was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame . An attempt to erect a statue in Kennett Square in his honor was blocked due to his support of segregation in baseball . Fred Heimach , a teammate of Pennock , once called him the smartest ball player he knew . In 1981 , Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Pennock in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time . He was inducted in the International League Hall of Fame in 1948 .

He was second in the league in home runs , third in hits and fourth in doubles . Defensively that season , he played third base . Parrott continued to play with the Portland club in 1891 , who were now renamed the Gladiators . During the season , the Spokane Daily Chronicle stated that , \" ' Jiggs ' [ Parrott ] was as much at home at third [ base ] as ever , and his throws to first [ base ] continue to excite the admiration of all the bleachers . \" At the start of the 1892 season , Parrott joined the Minneapolis Minnies of the Class-A Western League . Before the start of the season , The Sporting News said that Parrott \" has the build of a successful third baseman . He is tall and spare in flesh . He has been in a gymnasium all winter . \" With Minneapolis that season , he batted .317 with 31 runs scored , 53 hits , 13 doubles , and six home runs in 41 games played . He was tied for second in the league with James Graham , Joseph Katz and Billy O 'Brien in home runs . = = = Chicago Colts ( 1892 \u2013 95 ) = = = During the 1892 season , Cap Anson , the manager of the Chicago Colts , offered Parrott a Major League Baseball ( MLB ) contract to play with his club . Parrott made his MLB debut on July 11 , 1892 . During that game , he stuck out twice and made two errors . He was the first player from the State of Oregon to appear in an MLB game . Parrott hit second in the Colts ' batting order for most of the season . In his first MLB season , Parrott batted .201 with 38 runs scored , 67 hits , eight doubles , five triples , two home runs , 22 runs batted in ( RBIs ) , and seven stolen bases in 78 games played . He finished the season third in fielding percentage amongst National League third basemen ( .891 ) , behind Billy Nash and George Davis . Before the start of the 1893 season , The Sporting Life wrote that Parrott \" is somewhat of an erratic player . There are times when he plays good ball , but just when good steady play is necessary , he is very liable to get a case of ' rattles . ' \" However , in June , The Sporting Life changed its tune and called Parrott 's work at third base a \" little less than brilliant \" . It was reported that Anson was impressed by Parrott as a person , calling him a \" well-behaved young man \" despite some criticism he was getting from the media and fans . During the 1893 season , the Colts signed pitcher Tom Parrott , Jiggs Parrott 's brother . The Washington Post reported that Tom Parrott bought out his contract with his former team so he could play with his brother in Chicago . The two Parrott brothers were the only two players from Oregon to play in the MLB during the 19th century . Jiggs Parrott was moved to seventh in Chicago 's batting order during the year . In his second season , Parrott batted .244 with 54 runs scored , 111 hits , 10 doubles , nine triples , one home run , 65 RBIs , and 25 stolen bases in 110 games played . His fielding percentage at third base was the fifth highest in the National League ( .904 ) , behind Jack Crooks , Denny Lyons , George Pinkney and Billy Nash . At the start of the 1894 season , Parrott was converted to a second baseman , making way for Charlie Irwin at third base . Manager Cap Anson was criticized by The Sporting Life for continuing to play Parrott . The publication stated , \" It is true that [ Anson ] holds Parrot in high esteem and insists that ' Jiggs ' is a great infielder , hence a suffering public may confidently expect to witness still further attempts of ' Jiggs ' to hold down the second base bag . \" On the season , Parrott batted .248 with 82 runs scored , 130 hits , 17 doubles , nine triples , three home runs , 65 RBIs , and 30 stolen bases in 126 games played . In 1895 , Anson signed a new second baseman , Ace Stewart from Sioux City , Iowa , which demoted Parrott to the role of utility player . Anson responded to the criticism he had been taking for keeping Parrott by stating , \" I realize that ' Jiggs ' is not popular with the Chicago crowds , so we will play him in games abroad only . \" However , The Sporting Life responded by saying , \" The local scribes and fans thought we had buried the lanky ' Jigglets , ' so far as Chicago was concerned , but he bobs up serenely . \" Parrott 's final MLB game came on June 6 , 1895 . He played just three games with Chicago that season . In those games , he batted .250 with one hit in four at-bats . He was released early in the season . = = = Later career ( 1895 \u2013 97 ) = = = After being released by the MLB Chicago Colts , Parrott returned to the minor leagues with the Class-B Rockford Forest Citys / Reds of the Western Association . On the season with Rockford , he batted .351 with 18 runs scored , 40 hits , five doubles and two triples in 26 games played . In 1896 , he started the season with the Grand Rapids Rippers / Gold Bugs of the Class-A Western League as their starting third baseman . On June 22 , he was released by the Grand Rapids club . Parrott then signed with the Columbus Buckeyes / Senators , also of the Western League . Combined between the two clubs that year , he batted .306 in 86 games played . In 1897 , he re-signed with the Columbus Senators . As a member of the Columbus club , The Milwaukee Journal noted in September that Parrott had \" been playing a great fielding game \" . However , he appeared in just one game with the Senators , getting one hit in four at-bats . He then signed with the Dubuque , Iowa club of the Class-B Western Association . In 15 games , he batted .213 with six runs scored and 13 hits . = = Death = = After the 1897 baseball season , he returned to his home in Portland , Oregon with his health deteriorating . In December , Parrott traveled to New Mexico in hopes of re-gaining his health . When in New Mexico , he reported that the weather was too cold and that he was planning to move to Arizona where the climate is more mild . On April 14 , 1898 , while in a hospital in Phoenix , Arizona , Parrott died of tuberculosis . Earlier that day , Parrott had telegraphed his father , Thomas H. Parrott , back in Portland alerting him that it was not likely he would live two more days . Upon receiving the telegram , Thomas H. Parrott sent his son , Archie Parrott , on a train to Arizona to be with the dying Jiggs Parrott . However , after the train left the station in Portland , the Parrott family got word that Jiggs Parrott had died . Archie Parrott continued to Arizona to retrieve his brother 's remains . His remains were returned on April 23 . Parrott 's funeral was held on April 25 , at his home in East Portland . His pall-bearers were several former teammates from the Portland Willamettes : Joseph Beveridge , Charles Neale , Frank Buchtel , William Kern , Fred Bailey , and John Rankin . According to The Oregonian hundreds attended his funeral and 500 people attended his burial at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland ."

                    "text": "The Fox , the Wolf and the Husbandman = The Fox , the Wolf and the Husbandman is a poem by the 15th-century Scottish poet Robert Henryson and part of his collection of moral fables known as the Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian . It is written in Middle Scots . As with the other tales in the collection , appended to it is a moralitas which elaborates on the moral that the fable is supposed to contain . However , the appropriateness of the moralitas for the tale itself has been questioned . The tale combines two motifs . Firstly , a husbandman tilling the fields with his new oxen makes a rash oath aloud to give them to the wolf ; when the wolf overhears this , he attempts to make sure that the man fulfills his promise . The fox mediates a solution by speaking to them individually ; eventually he fools the wolf into following him to claim his supposed reward for dropping the case , and tricks him into a draw-well . The moralitas connects the wolf to the wicked man , the fox to the devil , and the husbandman to the godly man . A probable source for the tale is Petrus Alfonsi 's Disciplina Clericalis , containing the same motifs , and William Caxton 's Aesop 's Fables \u2014 though the tale is a beast fable , not Aesopic . = = Source = = A probable source of the tale is Petrus Alfonsi 's Disciplina clericalis , which has the same three motifs : the rash promise of the husbandman ; the wolf mistaking the moon for cheese ; and the wolf that descends into the well via a bucket , thereby trapping himself and freeing the fox . However , the discussion of legality and the questioning of language that take place alongside these motifs are entirely Henryson 's invention . Whereas the moral of Alfonsi 's tale explains that the wolf lost both the oxen and the cheese because he \" relinquished what was present for what was to come \" ( Latin : pro futuro quod presens erat dimisit ) , Henryson 's moralitas more fully involves the husbandman . Another source may be Aesop 's Fables as published by William Caxton \u2014 scholar John MacQueen considers this more likely than Disciplina clericalis \u2014 although the tale itself is not Aesopic but rather of the beast fable ( also beast-epic ) genre . The plots of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart , tend more towards ribaldry , and feature the fox making a victim of the wolf . = = Synopsis = = = = = Tale = = = A husbandman tilling the fields with his new , untrained oxen is made furious by their wrecking of the land . In his anger he makes the rash oath that the wolf \" mot have you all at anis ! [ may , at once ] \" . However , the wolf is lying nearby with the fox , and , overhearing it , promises to make him stay true to his word . Eventually the oxen calm down , but on the way back home the wolf jumps into their path . The wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them , since they are not his , to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before . The wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration , to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything . They argue , and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness ; in response , he produces the fox . The creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute , and takes each aside in turn . To the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him were it not for the \" grit coist and expence \" of doing so ; the husbandman offers him half a dozen of the fattest hens he has , to which the fox acedes and goes off . To the wolf he says that the husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping the case . The wolf , after some complaint , agrees to this and the two proceed through the woods after the prize \u2014 all the while the fox considers how to trick the wolf . Eventually , as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest , they arrive at a draw-well with buckets on each end of a rope . Seeing the reflection of the moon in the water at the bottom of the well , the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up . When he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone , the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help . However , this pulls up the other bucket , into which the fox has jumped , and so the two swap places ; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped . The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well , but that the tale is at an end . = = = Moralitas = = = The wolf is likened to a wicked man who oppresses others . The fox is likened to the devil . The farmer is likened to the godly man , with whom the fiend finds fault . The woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get . The cheese represents covetousness ; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy , which draws men downwards into hell . = = Analysis = = As with other tales in the collection , the moralitas of The Fox , the Wolf and the Husbandman can be considered at odds with the tale itself . Lianne Farber highlights a number of these discrepancies , and says that the allegory \" does not hold true in any traditional sense \" . Amongst the inconsistencies is that the fox , not the wolf , is the figure that argues with and finds fault in the husbandman ; the \" woods of the world \" are not traversed by the husbandman , in spite of the moralitas suggesting it is applicable to all men ; Farber argues that even assuming the moral to be true is problematic , since it apparently suggests that the godly man must bribe the figure of the judge , and that this does not affect his godly status . Furthermore , the absence of the legal discussion and the binding quality of words from the moralitas suggests to Farber that the \" intricate legal framework \u2026 has no impact whatsoever in resolving the issues with which it is supposed to deal \" . In contrast , Philippa M. Bright considers that the moralitas of this tale , as well as several others , create \" an additional sense which co-exists with the literal narrative and extends and complements it thematically \" ; treating literal details symbolically and establishing the sense through direct comparisons . According to Dorothy Yamamoto , the significant themes in the tale are \" solidity and vacancy , substance and illusion \" . The cheese that apparently resides in the well is only an illusion , not a solid object , and similarly the fox creates a surface reconciliation between the wolf and the husbandman , but which betrays his real intentions . Through their frequent misuse , words that should convey real value are emptied of meaning . As an example , Yamamoto highlights the fox 's taill on which the wolf and husbandman make their pledge \u2014 which body part she says is used by the fox in other tales to blind his foes , and is thereby a highly inappropriate object to use . = = = Modern edition = = = Henryson , Robert ( 2009 ) .

                    "text": "Madison Bumgarner = Madison Kyle Bumgarner ( born August 1 , 1989 ) , commonly known by his nickname , \" MadBum \" , is an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . Bumgarner was born in Hickory , North Carolina , and attended South Caldwell High School in Hudson , North Carolina , where he helped his baseball team win the 2007 4A State Championship . He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round ( tenth overall ) in the 2007 MLB draft out of high school . In his first year playing professionally , 2008 , he won the South Atlantic League pitching triple crown . He made his major league debut in 2009 with the Giants . In 2010 , he began the season in the minor leagues but was called up midway through the season and wound up becoming the youngest left-handed pitcher to throw eight scoreless innings in a World Series as the Giants won the 2010 World Series , their first since 1954 . In 2014 , Bumgarner set a career high number of wins with 18 and won his third World Series as a Giant . Following one of the most dominant postseason and World Series pitching performances in modern MLB history , he was named the Most Valuable Player of the 2014 World Series , the 2014 Babe Ruth Award winner , the 2014 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year , and the 2014 Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year . He made history by becoming one of only 4 pitchers to ever intentionally bat for himself in a game played in an American League park , rather than use the designated hitter . = = Early life = = Bumgarner was born August 1 , 1989 , in Hickory , North Carolina , and grew up in an area ten miles away nicknamed \" Bumtown \" because of the abundance of people with the surname Bumgarner who have lived there over the years after their ancestors had arrived from Germany . He grew up in a log house that his father , Kevin , built , sleeping in a loft at nights . Bumgarner 's first word was \" ball \" , and by the age of four , he was already playing in a youth baseball league . His father had to sign a waiver because the league was for five- to eight-year-olds . His parents , Kevin and Debbie , divorced while Bumgarner was in high school . Much like fellow Major League pitcher Brett Cecil , throwing a ball is the only thing Bumgarner does left-handed Bumgarner attended South Caldwell High School in Hudson , North Carolina , where he was known as \" Maddie \" to his friends and was a member of the Spartans baseball team . In his junior season , he had a 12 \u2013 2 record , an 0.99 earned run average ( ERA ) , and 120 strikeouts in 84 innings pitched as he led his team to a runner-up in the 2006 4A State Championship . Next season , he went 11 \u2013 2 with a 1.05 ERA and 143 strikeouts in 86 innings while this time helping his team win the 2007 4A State Championship . He batted .424 with 11 home runs and 38 runs batted in . He was named Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) of the playoffs and the Gatorade North Carolina Player of the Year , garnering the nickname \" The Carolina Peach \" . In 2013 , the North Carolina High School Athletic Association included him on its \" 100 To Remember \" male athletes list , which included Michael Jordan , Carl Eller , and Jim Beatty . Bumgarner attracted so much attention from scouts and agents in high school that his father built a wall around the bullpen at his high school field to keep them from distracting him as he warmed up for games . He committed to attend the University of North Carolina on a college baseball scholarship . = = Professional career = = = = = Draft and minor leagues = = = The San Francisco Giants selected Bumgarner in the first round ( 10th overall ) of the 2007 MLB draft . Going into the draft , Baseball America had ranked him as the 14th best prospect overall . He was the first high school pitcher to be selected by the Giants on their first pick since Matt Cain in 2002 , and the first left-handed pitcher selected in the first round by the organization since Noah Lowry in 2001 . Bumgarner pitched for the Augusta Greenjackets , the Giants ' Low-A South Atlantic League affiliate , in 2008 . The Giants sought for him to alter the angle of his head during his delivery , but after Bumgarner struggled over his first three starts in Augusta , he reverted to the way he had thrown in high school . With Augusta , he worked on the changeup , the slider , and \" the ability to pitch inside . \" When asked if it was tough to work on off-speed pitches in a league in which most of the hitters can be fooled with the fastball , Bumgarner replied , \" The minors are all about player development . I needed to work on other pitches and have the confidence to throw them . \" He won the South Atlantic League pitchers ' Triple Crown , tying for the league lead in wins ( 15 , tied with Levi Maxwell ) , leading the league in earned run average ( 1.46 ) , and leading the league in strikeouts ( 164 ) . He began the 2009 season with the Giants ' High-A affiliate , the San Jose Giants of the California League . After five starts , in which he went 3 \u2013 1 with a 1.48 ERA and 23 strikeouts , he was called up to the Giants AA affiliate , the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League . On July 22 , he hit a grand slam against Eric Niesen and picked up the victory in a 9 \u2013 3 triumph over the Binghamton Mets . In 20 games ( 19 starts ) with them , he went 9 \u2013 1 with a 1.93 ERA and 69 strikeouts . In 2008 , Baseball America ranked him the third-best prospect in the Giants organization . Before the start of the 2009 season , the magazine ranked Bumgarner as the ninth-best prospect in baseball . Entering 2010 , he dropped to the 14th-best prospect in baseball on the magazine 's list , as some writers were concerned about a drop in Bumgarner 's velocity . Jason Grey of ESPN wrote that the drop was \" puzzling . \" = = = San Francisco Giants ( 2009 \u2013 present ) = = = = = = = 2009 \u2013 2010 = = = = Bumgarner was called up to the majors on September 8 , 2009 , to make his first major league start and debut in place of Tim Lincecum , who was scratched with back spasms . At the age of 20 , he became the second youngest pitcher ever to start a game for the Giants since the franchise moved west in 1958 . He was older only than Mike McCormick , who played as a 19-year-old for San Francisco but had made his debut with the Giants two years earlier when the team was still in New York . Bumgarner made four appearances with the Giants in 2009 , posting an ERA of 1.80 , striking out 10 batters , and pitching 10 innings without recording a decision . Bumgarner attended the Giants ' spring training before the 2010 season , competing for the position of fifth starter . However , out of shape after attending his half-sister 's funeral , he struggled and was sent down to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies , partly due to a drop in his velocity . In 14 starts with Fresno , he went 7 \u2013 1 with a 3.16 ERA and 59 strikeouts . On June 26 , 2010 , Bumgarner was called up again to join the club , facing the Boston Red Sox the next day . He replaced Joe Martinez , who had made one start in place of an injured Todd Wellemeyer , in the rotation . On July 6 , 2010 , against the Milwaukee Brewers in Milwaukee , Bumgarner earned his first major league victory , 6 \u2013 1 , going eight innings without yielding a run . Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer returned from the disabled list in August , Giants ' manager Bruce Bochy chose to use him in the bullpen and leave Bumgarner in the rotation . In five September starts during the Giants ' successful run to the National League West Division championship , Bumgarner posted an ERA of 1.13 . At the end of September , Bumgarner earned his first win at home , making him 7 \u2013 6 on the season . Despite a ten-day layoff , Bumgarner became the youngest pitcher in Giants ' franchise history to pitch in and win a postseason game , which he did against the Braves in the NLDS-clinching game on October 11 . In addition to his clinching performance in the NLDS , he pitched two shutout innings in relief in the NLCS clinching game versus the Philadelphia Phillies . On October 31 , Bumgarner pitched eight shutout innings in Game 4 of the 2010 World Series , becoming the fourth-youngest pitcher to start and win a World Series game , as well as the youngest to make a scoreless start of six innings or more . This win gave the Giants a 3 \u2013 1 lead in the series , en route to the Giants winning their first World Series championship in 56 years . After the season , he was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America 's 2010 All-Rookie Team . = = = = 2011 \u2013 2013 = = = = After his start May 13 , 2011 , Bumgarner was 0 \u2013 5 with a 4.58 ERA in his first seven starts of the season . He struggled in his first two games of the season , but soon after regained his post-season form . However , he was the victim of poor run support and bad luck . Despite pitching at least six innings and giving up more than one earned run only once in his five starts from April 27 through May 19 , it wasn 't until the 19th that he got his first win , collecting an ERA of 3.71 for the season at that point . By June 9 , Bumgarner had a 1.93 ERA over his last nine starts , yet had two wins and five losses to show for it . In seven of his eight losses at that point , the Giants either only scored once or scored no times at all .

Bumgarner began the 2012 season by going 5 \u2013 1 with a 2.31 ERA . With his win over the Brewers on May 5 , he became the first Giant since Jason Schmidt to win 14 games in a 20-game span . His ERA then rose to 2.85 after he lost three consecutive games , with his record moving to 5 \u2013 4 . After May 14 , the Giants went 16 home games without a home run until Bumgarner hit the first of his career into left field on June 12 , against Houston Astros pitcher Bud Norris . Bumgarner , with his home run and 12 strikeouts , became the most recent Giant to hit a home run and throw 10 + strikeouts since Mike Krukow , who was announcing the game .

The 2013 season saw Bumgarner set career bests for ERA ( 2.77 ) , walks plus hits per inning pitched ( WHIP ) ( 1.03 ) and strikeouts ( 199 ) in 31 starts , finishing with a 13 \u2013 9 record . Bumgarner 's WHIP was the lowest for a Giants ' left-hander since Carl Hubbell 's in 1933 . Bumgarner was also selected by Giants manager Bruce Bochy and the manager of the National League team , to pitch in the All Star game for the first time . However , Bumgarner didn 't pitch in the game . He took pride in pitching 200 + innings for the third consecutive season ( 201.1 ) and improving at holding runners on base , conceding 8 stolen bases in 2013 compared with 27 in 2012 . Bumgarner was rested for what would have been his final start of the season , following a great seven-inning , one-run , 10-strikeout win over the New York Mets .

Young won the championship at Genesis , after Storm passed out during the segment . This led to a bout between Storm and Young at TNA 's Turning Point PPV event on December 2 , 2007 , which Young won . Storm challenged Young to another drinking contest on the January 3 , 2008 episode of Impact ! . On January 6 , 2008 at TNA 's Final Resolution PPV event , Storm and Young competed in what was called the Beer Drinking Championship Series , which was a series of drinking contests . The first round was a \" never have I ever \" round , in which the participants had to admit to experiences they had never been involved in . If the opponent had partaken in a similar action he was forced to drink a shot . Storm was the victor of this round . The second round was contested with both participants having beer bottles taped to their hands and neither being allowed to go to the bathroom . Young won after Storm wet himself , which was confirmed by Ms. Jackie , now named Jackie Moore . The third round involved the two drinking shots ; it was won by Storm after Young passed out because Storm had drugged him . With Storm winning two contests to one , he earned the ability to determine their match at TNA 's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10 , 2008 . At Against All Odds , Young defeated Storm to retain the TNA World Beer Drinking Championship after Rhino interfered attacking Storm . On the February 28 , 2008 episode of Impact ! , a Ladder match for the World Beer Drinking Championship was held between Storm and Young . Storm won the bout after Moore climbed a ladder and retrieved the championship for Storm without the referee seeing . On the March 6 , 2008 episode of Impact ! , Rhino stole the title belt from Storm and bashed the belt across a ring post , thus destroying it and ending the storyline surrounding it . = = = Belt designs = = = When the title was revealed at Genesis , Chris Sokol of the Canadian Online Explorer spoke of its design in his review of the event .

He played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats . At Kentucky in 2015 , he led his team in assists , he made the 2015 SEC All-Freshman Team and led the 2014 \u2013 15 Kentucky team that won its first 38 games before losing to Wisconsin in the final four of the 2015 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . As a sophomore , Ulis was a Consensus first team All-American and earned the Southeastern Conference Men 's Basketball Player of the Year and the Southeastern Conference Men 's Basketball Defensive Player of the Year recognition . He played for Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights , Illinois . He was selected to play in both the 2014 McDonald 's All-American Game and the 2014 Jordan Brand Classic . As a high school junior , he was a first team All-state selection , but he was overlooked by most top scouts until after his junior year of high school due to his height . = = Early life = = Ulis was born in Southfield , Michigan , and lived in Lima , Ohio , with his mother . He ran track as a youth , competing in the 800 meters and 1500 meters . He trained for basketball with his cousin and 2009 Big Ten Conference Defensive Player of the Year Travis Walton . Another of his cousins is Shareese Ulis , point guard for Cincinnati Lady Bearcats , who had been a two-time Toledo Blade Player of the Year . = = High school career = = For high school , Ulis moved to Matteson , Illinois , where he lived with his father , James . In Ohio , he had been used to winning a high percentage of his games . When he arrived at Marian Catholic , he started his first game as a freshman against future Illinois Fighting Illini men 's basketball starting guard Tracy Abrams . He did not initially enjoy team success . As a freshman he was 5 feet 3 inches ( 1.60 m ) tall and was being recruited by opposing high schools . He reached 5 feet 8 inches ( 1.73 m ) by late in his sophomore year and began being recruited by college basketball teams . By the beginning of his junior season , Marian Catholic was regarded as a serious contender thanks to Ulis . Because of his height , Ulis was overlooked until well into the recruiting process for top basketball schools . He was not highly recruited until his 2013 \u2013 14 senior year of high school . Among schools regarded as high-major programs , only Iowa and DePaul made him offers during his junior year . His other offers were from Dayton , Colorado State , Loyola , Northern Illinois and Oregon State . During his junior season , his stock soared and Marian Catholic started winning . In the March 2013 Illinois High School Association Class 4A sectional round , Marian Catholic vied against Bloom High School and then played Edwardsville High School in the supersectional round . Although Marian lost to a much taller Edwardsville team , it established a school record for wins with a 29 \u2013 4 record and it won its IHSA sectional for the first time . Ulis finished fourth in the Illinois Mr. Basketball balloting behind Jabari Parker , Jahlil Okafor and Malcolm Hill . He was a first team All-state selection by the Chicago Tribune along with Parker , Okafor , Cliff Alexander and Jalen Brunson . By August 8 , 2013 , when he was ranked as the 38th best prospect in the national class of 2014 and its 8th best point guard by ESPN , he had several offers and named Iowa , Kentucky ( although he did not have an offer from them at the time ) , Michigan State and USC as his finalists ( eliminating DePaul , Florida State , Northwestern and Purdue ) . Walton had played for Michigan State . He received an official offer from Kentucky on August 16 . In early September , Ulis announced that he would not take an official visit to USC and had eliminated them from consideration . On September 13 , Ulis committed to Kentucky . Subsequently , Tyus Jones canceled his September 27 \u2013 29 official visit to Kentucky . Ulis entered his senior season as one of the five favorites to win Illinois Mr. Basketball ( along with Okafor , Alexander , Brunson and Keita Bates-Diop ) . On December 7 , 2013 at the UIC Pavilion in the Chicago Elite Classic , Ulis and Marion suffered one of their only two regular season losses to USC-bound guard Jordan McLaughlin and Etiwanda High School , which was ranked number 6 nationally by USA Today . Ulis had 30 points , 7 assists and 5 rebounds . The January 25 , 2014 , matchup against junior Brunson and Stevenson High School was widely anticipated in the local press as the matchup of the two best point guards in the state . Stevenson won as Brunson had 32 points on 9-for-15 field goal shooting and an 11-for-14 free throw performance . Ulis had 23 points and 9 assists , including 18 points and 3 assists in the final eight minutes , but was only 5-for-20 from the field for the game . Ulis posted a career-high 42 points on February 22 against Lake Forest High School to go along with 6 steals , 6 rebounds and 5 assists . During his senior year , Marian was the number 1 seed in the Thornton sectional of the IHSA Class 4A tournament . On March 11 , Ulis had 40 points to lead Marian past Bloom High School 66 \u2013 45 . In the game , which was a rematch from the prior year , he made his first six shots , all three-pointers . On March 18 , Marian lost its supersectional rematch against Edwardsville in overtime , again falling one game short of reaching the final four in Peoria , Illinois and finishing with a 28 \u2013 3 record . In the game , Ulis , who had 23 points and 4 assists , tied the score with 21 seconds in regulation and with 50 seconds left in overtime . In the April 18 Jordan Brand Classic , Ulis posted 9 points and 9 assists . = = = Awards and honors = = = He was selected to the 2014 McDonald 's All-American Game on January 29 ( along with fellow Chicagoans Okafor and Alexander as well as along with fellow Kentucky commits Karl-Anthony Towns , Trey Lyles , and Devin Booker ) . On March 10 he was one of 26 players selected for the April 18 , 2014 Jordan Brand Classic again along with fellow Chicagoans Okafor and Alexander as well as along with fellow Kentucky commits Towns , Lyles , and Booker . He was named Associated Press Class 4A 1st team All-state with Alexander , Brunson , Okafor and Sean O 'Mara . Ulis finished third to Okafor and Alexander in the Illinois Mr. Basketball voting . He was the runner-up in both the skills competition and the three-point contest at the McDonald 's All-American Game . He was a 2014 USA Today third team All-USA Boys Basketball Team selection . The decision by Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison on whether to enter the 2014 NBA draft would be the determining factor on whether Ulis became an immediate starter or not . Many thought Andrew would be Calipari 's seventh consecutive point guard to declare for the NBA Draft after his freshman season , but that Ulis would likely last much longer at Kentucky . On April 25 , the Harrisons announced that they would be returning to Kentucky . = = College career = = = = = Freshman year = = = Ulis was also named to the 36-man 2014 \u2013 15 Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List and the Wayman Tisdale Award Watch List . Ulis quickly earned a reputation as a difference maker whose contributions may not be obvious in the statistics . On December 10 , he was sidelined with an injury . Ulis posted a career high 14-points on December 27 against Louisville in the Kentucky \u2013 Louisville rivalry game known as the The Battle For The Bluegrass , earning the MVP of the game from the The Bluegrass Sports Commission . On December 29 , his effort was recognized with an SEC Freshman of the Week honor . Ulis did not start in any his 37 games played as a freshman , but averaged 23.8 minutes played . Following the season , he was named to the 8-man 2015 SEC All-Freshman Team . Kentucky went undefeated in its first 38 games before losing to Wisconsin in the Final Four of the 2015 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . Ulis led the team in assists per game . = = = Sophomore year = = = Ulis was a selection to the 20-man Bob Cousy Award preseason watchlist , and the 30-man Lute Olson Award preseason watchlist . He was also a 2015 \u2013 16 Southeastern Conference preseason first team All-conference selection by the media . In preseason top 100 player rankings Ulis was ranked 5 by ESPN and 22 by NBC Sports . During the preseason , Mike Rutherford of SB Nation selected Ulis as one of its 10 most important college basketball players for 2015-16 . He made the initial 50-man John R. Wooden Award watch list on November 17 . On December 2 , Ulis earned recognition on the 50-man Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist and 33-man Robertson Trophy watchlists . Ulis opened the season in the starting lineup against the Albany Great Danes on November 13 .

Ulis was named to the January 25 20-man Oscar Robertson Trophy midseason watch list . On January 30 , Ulis posted a career-high 26 points and 8 assists against # 4-ranked Kansas , but Kentucky lost in overtime . On February 1 , Ulis was named one of 10 finalists for the Bob Cousy Point Guard of the Year Award . Entering play on February 13 , Kentucky and South Carolina were tied atop of the 2015 \u2013 16 Southeastern Conference standings . In a game between the two , Ulis posted new career highs with 27 points and 12 assists , leading the team to an 89 \u2013 62 victory , after coach Calipari was ejected early . He was named to the 35-man midseason watchlist for the Naismith Trophy on February 11 . Ulis was included in the Wooden Award Late season Top 20 Watch List on February 12 .

On March 5 , Ulis closed out the regular season with a career-high 14 assists and 14 points against the LSU Tigers . Following the 2015 \u2013 16 Southeastern Conference men 's basketball season , Ulis was named the SEC Player of the Year by both SEC head coaches and the Associated Press , and was also named by the coaches as SEC Defensive Player of the Year ( the AP does not select this award , or an SEC all-defensive team ) . He placed on both voting bodies ' All-Conference first teams , and was named to the coaches ' All-SEC defensive team . He was the second player ( after Anthony Davis ) to earn both the SEC Player of the Year and SEC Defensive Player of the Year honors in the same season . Ulis earned broad 2016 NCAA Men 's Basketball All-Americans recognition . He was a first team selection by USA Today , ESPN , Sports Illustrated , NBC Sports , Associated Press , CBS Sports , and Sporting News ; He was a second team selection by the USBWA and NABC . Ulis was named one of four finalists for the Naismith Trophy on March 20 . He was named one of 10 finalists for the Wooden Award on March 29 . When naming Ulis to its All-American team , Associated Press described Ulis as the shortest All-American since Johnny O 'Brien in 1953 . Ulis won the Bob Cousy Award . In the 2016 SEC Men 's Basketball Tournament , Ulis scored 25 points and had 4 assists in the semifinal victory over Georgia on March 12 . In the finals against regular season co-champion Texas A & M on March 13 , Ulis posted a career-high 30 points . He played all 45 minutes of the overtime contest . Ulis was tournament MVP . In the 2016 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , Kentucky renewed its rivalry with Indiana in the round of 32 on March 20 . Ulis posted 27 points in the 73 \u2013 67 loss to the 2015 \u2013 16 Hoosiers . = = Professional career = = At the conclusion of his sophomore season , Ulis announced his intention to forgo his final two seasons of eligibility and enter the 2016 NBA draft . During the 2016 NBA Draft Combine , Ulis was not only the second-shortest player to participate in the event ( behind only Kahlil Felder , who measured at 5 ' 9.5 \" with shoes on ( 5 ' 8.5 \" without shoes ) as opposed to an even 5 ' 10 \" with shoes on ( 5.8.75 \" without them ) ) , but he was also the lightest recorded player in draft combine history at 149 pounds . Furthermore , about two weeks before the draft began , it was revealed that Ulis had a problem with his hip that may one day require surgery . As a result , his draft stock declined from being an expected mid-first round selection to being either a late-first round or early-second round selection . Ulis downplayed the issue , claiming that his hip was just fine . However , Ulis was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round with their 34th selection , being reunited with his best friend and former college teammate Devin Booker in the process . He became the fifth Kentucky player on the Suns ' roster along with fellow guards Eric Bledsoe , Archie Goodwin , Brandon Knight , and Booker . On July 7 , he signed with the Suns and joined the team for the 2016 NBA Summer League . Ulis received the equivalent of a late first-round pick 's contract , starting at around $ 1 million and having the same two guaranteed years with two team option years . Over six games at the Las Vegas Summer League , he averaged 14.5 points and 6.3 assists per game , subsequently earning All-NBA Summer League Second Team honors .",

                    "text": "Interstate 40 in Arizona = Interstate 40 ( I-40 ) is an east \u2013 west Interstate Highway that has a 359.6-mile ( 578.72 km ) section in the U.S. state of Arizona connecting sections in California to New Mexico . It enters Arizona from the west at a crossing of the Colorado River southwest of Kingman . It travels eastward across the northern portion of the state connecting the cities of Kingman , Ash Fork , Williams , Flagstaff , Winslow , and Holbrook . I-40 continues into New Mexico , heading to Albuquerque . The highway has major junctions with U.S. Route 93 ( US 93 ) in Kingman , the main highway connecting Phoenix and Las Vegas , Nevada , and I-17 in Flagstaff , the Interstate linking Phoenix and Flagstaff . For the majority of its routing through Arizona , I-40 follows the historic alignment of U.S. Route 66 . The lone exception is a stretch between Kingman and Ash Fork where US 66 took a more northerly , less direct route that is now State Route 66 . Construction of I-40 was ongoing in the 1960s and 1970s and reached completion in 1984 . With the completion of I-40 in 1984 , the entire routing of US 66 had been bypassed by Interstate Highways which led to its decertification a year later in 1985 . = = Route description = = = = = California to Flagstaff = = = I-40 enters Arizona from California at a bridge that crosses the Colorado River at Topock in Mohave County . It heads east from Topock and begins to curve towards the north at Franconia and completes the curve to the north at Yucca . The interstate continues to head north until it reaches Kingman . In this city , I-40 has a junction with US 93 at exit 48 . US 93 heads towards the northwest from this junction to Hoover Dam and Las Vegas . US 93 south begins to run concurrently with I-40 as they both head east through Kingman . The two separate at exit 71 as US 93 heads towards the south towards Phoenix while I-40 heads east towards Flagstaff . I-40 continues towards the east , passing through the town of Seligman and then at Ash Fork , where it meets State Route 89 , the main highway that heads south to Prescott . Next , it passes through Williams at exit 165 with SR 64 , and heads north towards Grand Canyon National Park . I-40 continues to the east to Flagstaff , where it has a junction with I-17 at exit 195 . I-17 heads south from the interchange with I-40 to Phoenix . = = = Flagstaff to New Mexico = = = East of Flagstaff , I-40 heads towards the east-southeast direction as it goes through the town of Winslow . It continues towards this direction until it reaches Holbrook , where it curves towards the northeast . Along this stretch , it passes through Petrified Forest National Park and continues to the northeast , passing through Chambers , and enters the Navajo Indian Reservation . The highway still continues to the northeast to the New Mexico border southwest of Gallup , New Mexico as it continues on towards Albuquerque . = = History = = With the exception of a stretch between Kingman and Flagstaff , I-40 directly replaced the famed US 66 across northern Arizona . Where possible , US 66 was upgraded to Interstate standards to become I-40 directly . Exceptions to this were through the central business districts of the cities and towns that US 66 passed through , and I-40 had to be built as a bypass outside the cities . On October 26 , 1984 , after the last section of I-40 was completed in Williams , US 66 was removed from the state highway system of Arizona . The portions through cities that did not overlap I-40 would become business loops of I-40 . = = = Before the U.S. Highways = = = The routing of a road near the current corridor of I-40 in Arizona was first surveyed and built between 1857 and 1859 . Lt. Edward Beale and his soldiers built the road along the 35th parallel that would come to be known as the Beale Wagon Road from Ft . Smith , Arkansas to the Colorado River to serve as a military wagon road . The road was a popular route for immigrants during the 1860s and 1870s until the transcontinental railroad was built across northern Arizona in the 1880s . In the early 1900s , the road became part of the National Old Trails Road , a transcontinental route from Baltimore , Maryland to California , and the National Park to Park Highway , an auto trail linking the national parks of the west . = = = U.S. Route 66 = = = In the 1920s , as a nationwide system of highways called the United States Numbered Highways was being developed , the route through was given the designation of U.S. Route 60 . This designation was controversial since designations that are multiples of 10 are assigned to transcontinental east \u2013 west routes and this route was a diagonal route from Chicago to Los Angeles . As a compromise to states east of Chicago that felt US 60 should go through their state , a different route was given the number 60 , while the route from Chicago to Los Angeles was given the number 66 . By 1927 , the routing of US 66 through Arizona had been laid out , but none of it had been paved yet . By 1935 , nearly the entire route had been paved , with the lone exceptions being a short stretch northeast of Valentine and a stretch between Peach Springs and Seligman . By 1938 , the entire route in Arizona had been paved . In 1953 , US 66 was realigned between the California border and Kingman to an alignment to the southeast to avoid the mountain curves and grades of the original alignment . By 1961 , several sections of the highway had been expanded to a four-lane divided highway in anticipation of the coming Interstate Highway . Four-lane sections included a section near Ash Fork , another section east of Winslow and a section east of Holbrook near the Petrified Forest National Monument . = = = Planning = = = In Flagstaff , several different alternatives were considered as a potential routing of the new Interstate through the area . The alternatives consisted of a routing north of downtown , south of downtown , through downtown along the Santa Fe Railroad right-of-way near the alignment of US 66 , and a more elaborate alternative of a routing above downtown on a long overpass . In January 1959 , the Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce recommended to the Bureau of Public Roads that the route south of downtown be used which was approved by the Flagstaff City Council and the Board of Supervisors for Coconino County . This recommendation was accepted and would become the planned routing of I-40 in Flagstaff . Business owners along US 66 were opposed to this routing as it would draw motorists away from main through route of the time , US 66 . As a result , they created the No By-Pass Committee and sent a proposal to the Chamber of Commerce \u2019 s Roads and Highways Committee to conduct a study of the feasibility of a route for I-40 through downtown along the Santa Fe railroad right-of-way . The Committee sent an inquiry to the railroad concerning the proposal . The railroad rejected the proposed rerouting of their main rail lines citing that it would result in worse grades than what currently exists and in order to reduce those grades , considerable lengthening of the rail line would be required . With a routing through town now out of the question , the business owners along US 66 drafted a city ordinance , known as Initiative 200 , that was filed with the city of Flagstaff in November 1959 to appear on the general election ballot in March 1960 . The ordinance would in effect ban all new commercial businesses on I-40 , all routes leading from I-40 to US 66 , and the area between I-40 and US 66 . In a record voter turnout , voters overwhelmingly voted against the ordinance by a vote of 2,280 to 556 . In 1965 , the routing of I-40 west of Kingman was being reconsidered from the planned route through Needles , California to a route to the north passing through Searchlight in southern Nevada and connecting with I-15 further north of its present connection with I-15 . The rationale for the proposal was that it would be an overall shorter route and would cost much less to construct . The proposal was met with stiff opposition including all four U.S. senators from California and Arizona sending the Secretary of Commerce letters requesting that the routing through Needles be retained . This proposal was eventually abandoned in 1966 and the routing through Needles was kept . = = = Construction = = = The construction of the 360-mile ( 579 km ) route of I-40 across Arizona took nearly 25 years to complete with the last segment being completed in 1984 , much longer than the ambitious goal of finishing by 1972 . By the end of 1960 , 15 miles ( 24 km ) had been completed with an additional 23 miles ( 37 km ) miles being worked on . In 1964 , construction was still on schedule with 58 miles ( 93 km ) complete and an additional 71 miles ( 114 km ) under construction . Funding was becoming an issue at this time as the state lacked the available funds to stay on pace with a 1972 completion goal . By 1967 , Arizona had completed almost half of the highway with 155.3 miles ( 249.9 km ) complete and another 82.4 miles ( 133 km ) under construction . In 1968 , the bypass around Flagstaff was complete with three interchanges , two at each end of where US 66 split off from I-40 to enter the city and one at the I-17 interchange . An additional interchange at Butler Avenue was completed a year later . One of the big improvements of I-40 over US 66 was the construction of the segment between Kingman and Ash Fork . The 94-mile ( 151 km ) section is a more direct route between the two cities and travels as far as 20 miles ( 32 km ) south of the US 66 alignment , bypassing Hackberry and Peach Springs and creating ghost towns . Construction of the $ 69.1 million segment was also to be a much safer route as the US 66 alignment had one of the highest fatality rates of any section of highway in Arizona . This section of the Interstate was complete in 1975 . Construction of the $ 7.7 million bypass around Winslow began in 1977 . I-40 was completed in Arizona in 1984 , with the completion of a 6-mile ( 10 km ) section in Williams . This was also the last section of US 66 to be bypassed by the Interstate , which led to it being decertified by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) the following year . = = Exit list = =",

                    "text": "Wind shear = Wind shear , sometimes referred to as windshear or wind gradient , is a difference in wind speed and / or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere . Atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or horizontal wind shear . Vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with change in altitude . Horizontal wind shear is a change in wind speed with change in lateral position for a given altitude . Wind shear is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance , but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts . It is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms , fronts , areas of locally higher low-level winds referred to as low level jets , near mountains , radiation inversions that occur due to clear skies and calm winds , buildings , wind turbines , and sailboats . Wind shear has a significant effect during take-off and landing of aircraft due to its effects on control of the aircraft , and it has been a sole or contributing cause of many aircraft accidents . Wind shear is sometimes experienced by pedestrians at ground level when walking across a plaza towards a tower block and suddenly encountering a strong wind stream that is flowing around the base of the tower . This phenomenon is a concern for architects . Sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear , which can bend the wave front , causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not , or vice versa . Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development , but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into longer life cycles which can then produce severe weather . The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed at different heights are dependent on horizontal temperature differences , and explains the existence of the jet stream . = = Definition = = Wind shear refers to the variation of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances . Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots ( 15 m / s ) for light aircraft , and near 45 knots ( 22 m / s ) for airliners at flight altitude . Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9 knots ( 2.5 m / s ) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft . Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during take off and landing in disastrous ways , and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear ( headwind loss in excess of 30 knots ) . The rationale for this additional caution includes : ( 1 ) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less , ( 2 ) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind , ( 3 ) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations , and ( 4 ) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts . Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms . The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear . = = Where and when it is strongly observed = = Weather situations where shear is observed include : Weather fronts . Significant shear is observed when the temperature difference across the front is 5 \u00b0 C ( 9 \u00b0 F ) or more , and the front moves at 30 knots or faster . Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena , frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause , and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically . Vertical wind shear above warm fronts is more of an aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration . Upper-level jet streams . Associated with upper level jet streams is a phenomenon known as clear air turbulence ( CAT ) , caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient at the edge of the jet streams . The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet , usually next to or just below the axis of the jet . Low-level jet streams . When a nocturnal low-level jet forms overnight above the Earth 's surface ahead of a cold front , significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level jet . This is also known as nonconvective wind shear since it is not due to nearby thunderstorms . Mountains . When winds blow over a mountain , vertical shear is observed on the lee side . If the flow is strong enough , turbulent eddies known as \" rotors \" associated with lee waves may form , which are dangerous to ascending and descending aircraft . Inversions . When on a clear and calm night , a radiation inversion is formed near the ground , the friction does not affect wind above the top of the inversion layer . The change in wind can be 90 degrees in direction and 40 kt in speed . Even a nocturnal ( overnight ) low level jet can sometimes be observed . It tends to be strongest towards sunrise . Density differences cause additional problems to aviation . Downbursts . When an outflow boundary forms due to a shallow layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm , both speed and directional wind shear can result at the leading edge of the three dimensional boundary . The stronger the outflow boundary is , the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become . = = Horizontal component = = = = = Weather fronts = = = Weather fronts are boundaries between two masses of air of different densities , or different temperature and moisture properties , which normally are convergence zones in the wind field and are the principal cause of significant weather . Within surface weather analyses , they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols . The air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity . Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries . Cold fronts feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather , and may be preceded by squall lines and dry lines . Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts . When a front becomes stationary , it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed , known as a shear line , though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant . In the tropics , tropical waves move from east to west across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins . Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves , as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis . Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries . = = = Near coastlines = = = The magnitude of winds offshore are nearly double the wind speed observed onshore . This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters . Sometimes , there are even directional differences , particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours . = = Vertical component = = = = = Thermal wind = = = Thermal wind is a meteorological term not referring to an actual wind , but a difference in the geostrophic wind between two pressure levels <formula> and <formula> , with <formula> ; in essence , wind shear . It is only present in an atmosphere with horizontal changes in temperature ( or in an ocean with horizontal gradients of density ) , i.e. baroclinicity . In a barotropic atmosphere , where temperature is uniform , the geostrophic wind is independent of height . The name stems from the fact that this wind flows around areas of low ( and high ) temperature in the same manner as the geostrophic wind flows around areas of low ( and high ) pressure . The thermal wind equation is <formula> , where the <formula> are geopotential height fields with <formula> , <formula> is the Coriolis parameter , and <formula> is the upward-pointing unit vector in the vertical direction . The thermal wind equation does not determine the wind in the tropics . Since <formula> is small or zero , such as near the equator , the equation reduces to stating that <formula> is small . This equation basically describes the existence of the jet stream , a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is ( even though other factors are also important ) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole . = = = Effects on tropical cyclones = = = Tropical cyclones are basically heat engines that are fueled by the temperature gradient between the warm tropical ocean surface and the colder upper atmosphere . Tropical cyclone development requires relatively low values of vertical wind shear so that their warm core can remain above their surface circulation center , thereby promoting strengthening . Vertical wind shear tears up the \" machinery \" of the heat engine causing it to break down . Strongly sheared tropical cyclones weaken as the upper circulation is blown away from the low level center . The vertical wind shear in a tropical cyclone 's environment is very important . When the wind shear is weak , the storms that are part of the cyclone grow vertically , and the latent heat from condensation is released into the air directly above the storm , aiding in development . When there is stronger wind shear , this means that the storms become more slanted and the latent heat release is dispersed over a much larger area = = = Effects on thunderstorms and severe weather = = = Severe thunderstorms , which can spawn tornadoes and hailstorms , require wind shear to organize the storm in such a way as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time . This occurs as the storm 's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow . An increasing nocturnal , or overnight , low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere . Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions , which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm , moist air and kills the thunderstorm . = = = Planetary boundary layer = = = The atmospheric effect of surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise near the surface of the Earth blowing inward across isobars ( lines of equal pressure ) , when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth 's surface . This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer , sometimes the Ekman layer , and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night . Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation , or solar heating . Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear . These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft , and is most emphasized at night . = = = = Effects on flight = = = = = = = = = Gliding = = = = = In gliding , wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider . Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches , also known as winch launches or wire launches . If the wind gradient is significant or sudden , or both , and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude , the indicated airspeed will increase , possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed . The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient . When landing , wind shear is also a hazard , particularly when the winds are strong . As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing , airspeed decreases while sink rate increases , and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact . The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it . Wind shear is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground . It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan , which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle . The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing , causing a loss of control accident . = = = = = Parachuting = = = = = Wind shear or wind gradients are a threat to parachutists , particularly to BASE jumping and wingsuit flying . Skydivers have been pushed off of their course by sudden shifts in wind direction and speed , and have collided with bridges , cliffsides , trees , other skydivers , the ground , and other obstacles . Skydivers routinely make adjustments to the position of their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion . = = = = = Soaring = = = = = Soaring related to wind shear , also called dynamic soaring , is a technique used by soaring birds like albatrosses , who can maintain flight without wing flapping . If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude , a bird can climb into the wind gradient , trading ground speed for height , while maintaining airspeed . By then turning downwind , and diving through the wind gradient , they can also gain energy . It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions . Wind shear can also create wave . This occurs when an atmospheric inversion separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction . If the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by thermals coming up from below , it will create significant shear waves that can be used for soaring . = = = = = Impact on passenger aircraft = = = = = Strong outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level . Initially , this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed , which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear . As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft , the localized headwind diminishes , reducing the aircraft 's airspeed and increasing its sink rate . Then , when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft , the headwind becomes a tailwind , reducing lift generated by the wings , and leaving the aircraft in a low-power , low-speed descent . This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact . As the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s , most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191 , in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993 . Between 1964 and 1985 , wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries . Since 1995 , the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years , due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground ( NEXRAD ) . The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions . = = = = Sailing = = = = Wind shear affects sailboats in motion by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast . The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into the selection of sail twist in the sail design , but this can be difficult to predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions . Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear , for example using a boom vang . = = = = Sound propagation = = = = Wind shear can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere , where waves can be \" bent \" by refraction phenomenon . The audibility of sounds from distant sources , such as thunder or gunshots , is very dependent on the amount of shear . The result of these differing sound levels is key in noise pollution considerations , for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise , and must be considered in the design of noise barriers . This phenomenon was first applied to the field of noise pollution study in the 1960s , contributing to the design of urban highways as well as noise barriers . The speed of sound varies with temperature . Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude , sound is refracted upward , away from listeners on the ground , creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source . In the 1862 , during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka , an acoustic shadow , believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind , kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle , because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind . = = = = Effects on architecture = = = = Wind engineering is a field of engineering devoted to the analysis of wind effects on the natural and built environment . It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes , hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction . Wind engineering draws upon meteorology , aerodynamics and a number of specialist engineering disciplines . The tools used include climate models , atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models . It involves , among other topics , how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering . Wind turbines are affected by wind shear . Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those at the top of blade travel , and this in turn affects the turbine operation . This low level wind shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical . The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas .",

                "Maryland Route 30 = Maryland Route 30 ( MD 30 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . Known for most of its length as Hanover Pike , the highway runs 19.16 miles ( 30.84 km ) from MD 140 in Reisterstown north to the Pennsylvania state line near Melrose , where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 94 ( PA 94 ) . MD 30 is a major , two-lane regional highway in western Baltimore County and northeastern Carroll County . Locally , the highway serves the towns of Manchester and Hampstead ; the latter town is bypassed by the highway but served by a business route . Regionally , MD 30 connects Reisterstown and Baltimore with Hanover , Pennsylvania . MD 30 originated in the colonial era as part of a wagon road connecting the fledgling port of Baltimore with the new settlement that was to become Hanover . This highway was improved as a turnpike in the 19th century . MD 30 was constructed as a state road by the Maryland State Roads Commission in the late 1910s and early 1920s , and it became one of the original state-numbered highways in 1927 . The state highway was relocated and widened near Reisterstown in the late 1930s and along the rest of its route in the early 1950s . The Hampstead Bypass was planned as early as the 1960s to ameliorate the increasing congestion along the MD 30 corridor that was only exacerbated when I-795 was completed to Reisterstown in the late 1980s . However , the construction of the bypass was continually delayed due to environmental issues and politics . The bypass was finally constructed between 2006 and 2009 ; the old highway through Hampstead became MD 30 Business . A MD 30 bypass of Manchester has also been discussed since the 1960s , but the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) has no plans to construct the new highway in the foreseeable future . = = Route description = = MD 30 begins within the Reisterstown Historic District at an intersection with MD 140 , which heads south as Main Street and northwest as Westminster Pike . The state highway heads north as two-lane Hanover Pike through a residential area to a four-way intersection with MD 128 ( Butler Road ) and unsigned MD 795 , a connector between MD 30 and the northern terminus of I-795 ( Northwest Expressway ) at MD 140 that serves as a bypass of Reisterstown for MD 30 traffic . As the highway leaves Reisterstown , Old Hanover Pike splits to the northeast and MD 30 crosses over the Maryland Midland Railway . Old Hanover Pike reconnects with the state highway where the highway briefly parallels CSX 's Hanover Subdivision and passes to the east of the Montrose Mansion and Chapel . At the hamlet of Woodensburg , the old road splits northeast again to follow the railroad through the village of Boring . The railroad and old road return to MD 30 again just north of the state highway 's intersection with MD 91 ( Emory Road ) . MD 30 parallels the railroad through the community of Upperco , which is also known as Arcadia , before crossing the Baltimore \u2013 Carroll county line . Shortly after entering Carroll County , MD 30 curves northwest and meets the southern end of MD 30 Business ( Hanover Pike ) and Phillips Drive at a roundabout . While the business route heads north through the center of Hampstead , MD 30 passes to the west of the town on the Hampstead Bypass , which has two lanes but expands to a three- or four-lane divided highway for short stretches on either side of its roundabouts . The state highway passes under Houcksville Road and over Shiloh Road before meeting MD 482 ( Hampstead \u2013 Mexico Road ) at a roundabout . MD 30 reunites with the northern end of MD 30 Business at a roundabout in the community of Greenmount . The state highway , once again named Hanover Pike , has a short four-lane divided section through a commercial area before reducing to two lanes . MD 30 enters the town of Manchester as Main Street as the highway passes by Manchester Valley High School . In the center of town , the highway intersects Westminster Street and York Street ; along the latter street is Charlotte 's Quest Nature Center . MD 30 meets the northern end of MD 27 ( Manchester Road ) on the northern edge of downtown and the southern end of MD 86 ( Lineboro Road ) at the north town limit . There is no direct access from southbound MD 30 to northbound MD 86 ; that movement is made via Hallie Avenue , the next intersection to the south . MD 30 crosses Dug Hill Ridge just north of MD 86 and passes through the community of Melrose , where the highway intersects MD 496 ( Bachmans Valley Road ) and Wentz Road . The state highway follows the upper reaches of the South Branch of Gunpowder Falls through a ridge to the river 's source before reaching its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line . The highway continues as PA 94 ( Baltimore Pike ) through southwestern York County to Hanover . MD 30 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length except for the short segment in Reisterstown south of MD 128 and MD 795 ; that short segment is a National Highway System principal arterial . = = History = = = = = Wagon road to state highway = = = The first road along the corridor of MD 30 was a wagon road cut along an existing Indian trail in 1736 and 1737 to connect the Conewago Settlement , which later became Hanover , with Baltimore Town , which served as a much closer port for farmers and merchants in York County and Adams County , Pennsylvania , than Philadelphia . This road became known as the Conewago Road , Pack Horse Road , or the Wheelbarrow Road , the last due to the namesake implements being used to haul stones to widen the road by order of Maryland in 1793 . The highway became a toll road with the 1805 incorporation of the Baltimore and Reisterstown Turnpike Company , which operated between the two towns and split into Westminster and Hanover branches in Reisterstown . The latter branch became known as the Hanover Turnpike or the Baltimore and Hanover Turnpike and had ceased to collect tolls by 1899 . Work on modern MD 30 began in 1918 with the construction of a 39-foot ( 12 m ) -wide street through Reisterstown and a 15-to-16-foot ( 4.6 to 4.9 m ) concrete road north from Reisterstown to Woodensburg . By 1921 , the whole length of future MD 30 was planned for improvement and the concrete road had been extended to the southern end of Hampstead ; in addition , Main Street in Manchester had been paved in concrete . Main Street in Hampstead was rebuilt as a concrete street and the remainder of the highway to the Pennsylvania line , excluding Main Street in Manchester , was completed as a macadam road in 1923 . MD 30 was one of the original state-numbered highways marked in 1927 . By 1934 , the entire length of MD 30 was proposed to be widened from its existing width of 15 to 16 feet ( 4.6 to 4.9 m ) to 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) . The only major relocation of MD 30 in the 20th century was the elimination of a grade crossing at the Western Maryland Railway ( now the Maryland Midland Railway ) at Glen Morris . The present bridge over the railroad was completed in 1936 , but the relocated highway , which replaced what is now Old Hanover Road to the east , was not placed under construction until 1938 and did not open until 1939 . MD 30 was widened from Hampstead south to the Baltimore \u2013 Carroll county line in 1938 with a pair of 3-foot ( 0.91 m ) -wide macadam shoulders , expanding the road 's width to 21 feet ( 6.4 m ) . MD 30 was relocated in a few spots , widened , and resurfaced from the county line north to Manchester in 1950 , from the county line south to the north end of the Glen Morris relocation in 1951 and 1952 , and from Manchester north to the Pennsylvania state line in 1953 and 1954 . = = = Bypasses of Hampstead and Manchester = = = A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead has been contemplated since the 1940s and planned since at least 1960 . The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users : local traffic made up of people who had moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities ' small-town charm ; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work in the Baltimore area ; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover . The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987 . By the early 1990s , it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour ; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001 . Progress toward construction of the bypass was continually delayed . The bypass was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979 . The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990 , when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992 . However , in 1991 , the bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding . There have been several causes of the continual postponement of the bypass . In 1991 , heavy groundwater contamination by industrial chemicals was discovered near the southern end of the proposed route , then 5.8 miles ( 9.3 km ) long , at a Black & Decker factory and near the northern end of the planned route at a shopping center . The bypass route changed again in 1994 when a population of bog turtles was discovered along the bypass route . The bog turtle has been on the Maryland endangered species list since 1972 and was added to the \" threatened \" list under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1997 . In 1998 , the route of the Hampstead Bypass changed a third time when the bog turtle habitat was found to be larger than previously discovered . Delays were also ascribed to the state 's political climate . Carroll County is a heavily Republican county in a heavily Democratic state , and until the election of Bob Ehrlich as governor in 2002 , the state had not had a Republican governor since Spiro Agnew left office in 1969 . Local sentiment was that the county was relatively neglected and did not get its fair share of state highway funding for close to 40 years . By 1997 , the start of construction of the Hampstead Bypass was proposed for three to four years in the future ; at that time , most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased . The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001 . Finally , in 2004 , officials announced that the bypass would begin construction in autumn 2005 . Construction finally got underway in summer 2006 . Houcksville Road 's bridge over the bypass and the highway 's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007 . The roundabouts at MD 482 and at the southern end of the bypass opened , without connections to the under-construction bypass , in April and May of 2009 , respectively . The roundabout at the northern end of the bypass opened when the bypass opened to traffic on August 6 , 2009 . To minimize disruption to the bog turtle habitat , MDSHA installed tunnels under the bypass for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near the bypass rather than remove them with mechanical mowers . Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when the bypass opened . Since as early as 1967 , local officials have discussed building a Manchester bypass , either as a separate project or as part of a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester . However , by the mid-1970s , the town of Manchester decided it did not want the bypass . The bypass was planned to pass to the west of Manchester , but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the bypass route . The planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town . After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of the bypass , in 1993 the bypass was placed in the town 's master plan . However , state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening , who said the bypass would promote suburban sprawl . The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation 's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA 's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years . = = Junction list = = = = Related routes = = = = = Hampstead business route = = = Maryland Route 30 Business is a 4.00-mile ( 6.44 km ) business route of MD 30 through Hampstead . The business route begins at a four-leg roundabout with MD 30 , which heads south as Hanover Pike and northwest as the Hampstead Bypass , and Phillips Drive . MD 30 Business parallels CSX 's Hanover Subdivision through an industrial area that contains the headquarters of JoS . A. Bank Clothiers . The highway 's name changes from Hanover Pike to Main Street as it enters the town of Hampstead at an oblique grade crossing of the railroad . At the south end of downtown , MD 30 Business intersects the western ends of MD 88 ( Lower Beckleysville Road ) and MD 833 ( Black Rock Road ) . Gill Avenue is used to access eastbound MD 833 and the historic Hampstead School . North of downtown , the highway meets the eastern end of MD 482 ( Hampstead \u2013 Mexico Road ) and has another acute grade crossing of the Hanover Subdivision before exiting the town and becoming Hanover Pike again . In the community of Greenmount , the railroad veers away to the northeast and MD 30 Business veers northwest to its northern terminus at a three-leg roundabout with MD 30 , which heads southwest as the Hampstead Bypass and north as Hanover Pike toward Manchester . The highway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from the southern junction with MD 30 to MD 88 . MD 30 Business was created on August 6 , 2009 , along the former alignment of MD 30 through the town after MD 30 was relocated onto the Hampstead Bypass . Now that MD 30 has bypassed Hampstead , a streetscape project is planned to rebuild Main Street through town starting in 2014 or 2015 . = = = Auxiliary routes = = = MD 30 has two extant auxiliary routes and has had at least two such routes in the past . MD 30BC is the designation for the 0.05-mile ( 0.080 km ) connector between MD 30 Business and MD 30BZ in Greenmount just south of the northern end of the Hampstead Bypass . MD 30BC was assigned in 2009 upon the completion of the bypass . MD 30BZ is the designation for the 0.15-mile ( 0.24 km ) segment of Hanover Pike from a cul-de-sac north to where the highway turns east into a shopping center in Greenmount just south of the northern end of the Hampstead Bypass . The auxiliary route was part of MD 30 prior to the completion of the bypass in 2009 , when the route was assigned . MD 30C was the designation of the 0.05-mile ( 0.080 km ) segment of Doss Garland Drive from Phillips Drive to the county-maintained portion of Doss Garland Drive just west of the southern end of the Hampstead Bypass . The highway was assigned upon the completion of the bypass in 2009 and transferred to Carroll County maintenance in 2010 . MD 30D was the designation for 0.18-mile ( 0.29 km ) segment of Phillips Drive between its roundabout junction with MD 30 and MD 30 Business at the southern end of the Hampstead Bypass south to Wolf Hill Drive . The highway was assigned upon the completion of the bypass in 2009 and transferred to Carroll County maintenance in 2010 .",
                "M-21 ( Michigan highway ) = M-21 is an east \u2013 west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan connecting the cities of Grand Rapids and Flint . The highway passes through rural farming country and several small towns along its course through the Lower Peninsula . Following the course of a handful of rivers , M-21 also connects some of the state 's freeways like Interstate 96 ( I-96 ) , US Highway 127 ( US 127 ) and I-75 . The highway is used by between 1,700 and 36,000 vehicles daily . M-21 was designated along the highway by July 1 , 1919 between Ionia and Goodells near Port Huron . Changes made in the 1920s extended it on the west end to Holland and on the east end to Port Huron . M-21 was truncated at both of its current termini as two Interstate freeways were completed . I-196 functionally replaced M-21 between Holland and Grand Rapids with a portion retained under state maintenance as Old M-21 , now M-121 . I-69 replaced M-21 from Flint to Port Huron . A section of M-21 through Flint became M-56 . That designation was decommissioned in the 1980s when M-21 was returned to its former routing in Flint . = = Route description = = M-21 starts on Fulton Street at a junction with M-37 / M-44 ( East Beltline Avenue ) on the east side of greater Grand Rapids . Fulton passes through residential areas on this side of town , and crosses over I-96 . Continuing east , the highway passes the headquarters of Amway and crosses the Grand River near its confluence with the Thornapple River in Ada . M-21 runs long the north back of the Grand , turning southeasterly and east to Lowell . The roadway passes through downtown and over the Flat River near its confluence with the Grand . M-21 runs east of town through the southern end of the Lowell State Gaming Area and crosses into Ionia County . The road follows Bluewater Highway along the river , passing to the north of Saranac . It turns northeasterly through lightly forested farmland passing Bertha Brock Park as it approaches the city of Ionia . In town , M-66 runs concurrently along M-21 for a few blocks in the central business district . Bluewater Highway leaves town and continues along the Grand River to Muir , and the trunkline crosses the Maple River on east side of town . M-21 follows the course of the Maple briefly before turning east through farms along the Stony Creek to Pewamo . The highway bypasses the village to the south and crosses into Clinton County near the eastern edge of town . Western Clinton County 's landscape is dominated by farms , interrupted by the community of Fowler . The highway enters the county seat , St. Johns on State Street , passing through a residential section of town . In the middle of downtown , M-21 intersects 2nd Street , which carries Business US Highway 127 ( Bus . US 127 ) . East of downtown , M-21 passes back into agricultural land and under the US 127 freeway . The landscape is once again dominated by these farms through the western side of the county . M-21 passes into the community of Ovid and over the county line into Shiawassee County . Continuing east through the county , the highway enters Owosso . The trunkline follows Main Street into downtown and crosses the Shiawassee River between junctions with M-52 and M-71 in Owosso . M-21 runs roughly parallel to the river out into the country side . The remainder of the county is the same , dominated by farmland along a straight stretch of flat highway . North of Lennon , M-21 meets M-13 at an intersection on the Shiawassee \u2013 Genesee county line . The landscape starts to transition to residential subdivisions as the roadway approaches the Flint area . In Flint Township , M-21 follows Corunna Road and meets I-75 / US 23 at exit 118 . The road crosses a former branch line of the Canadian National Railway ( converted into a bicycle trail ) east of the interchange . Corunna Road angles to the northeast near Bradley Avenue and terminates at Court Street . The trunkline turns east and follows Court over a tributary of the Flint River near Aldrich Park . Northeast of the stream , M-21 splits along a one-way pairing of Court and 5th streets . Eastbound traffic follows 5th Street past the city and county buildings in the area . The highway passes over I-475 and terminates at the east frontage road . Traffic connecting between M-21 and I-475 must use the frontage roads to make the connection . All of M-21 , except for some segments just outside Grand Rapids and Flint , along with the highway split into two one-way streets inside Flint , is undivided surface road ; none of M-21 is freeway . The section between I-75 / US 23 and Saginaw Street in Flint is part of the National Highway System , a network of roadways important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . M-21 , like all state highways , is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . As part of these responsibilities , the department tracks traffic volumes along its highways . They use a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the average traffic along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year . Traffic volumes in 2009 vary from 22,756 vehicles in the Forest Hills neighborhood east of Grand Rapids to 1,719 vehicles in Pewamo daily . MDOT reported that the peak AADT was 36,053 vehicles daily near the I-75 interchange in the Flint area . = = History = = Before the Interstate era , M-21 extended across the entire Lower Peninsula , from the junction with US 31 in Holland near Lake Michigan east to the St. Clair River at Port Huron , and crossed into Canada where the Blue Water Bridge is currently located . M-21 was designated by July 1 , 1919 on a routing from Ionia to Goodells . Along the way , it ran through Lyons and Pewamo , joining its current routing to Ovid . M-21 continued through Corunna to Lennon and Flint . There it joined its last routing between Flint and the Port Huron area . The highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924 , and the west end was extended to Grand Rapids in 1925 along M-16 ( later US 16 ) . The previous routing through Owosso and Lennon was redesignated as M-71 at this time when M-21 was shifted along the current routing between the two communities . The 1926 creation of the United States Highway System led to the extension of M-21 along US 16 to Grand Rapids . From there west , M-21 replaced M-51 on Chicago Drive to Holland . The highway was moved to a new routing between Flint and Lapeer in 1929 ; the old route was renumbered M-21A . All in-city portions of M-21 were transferred to state control in 1931 with the passage of the Dykstra Act of 1931 ( PA 131 of 1931 ) . A Bypass M-21 ( Byp . M-21 ) designation was created in the Grand Rapids area in 1945 . This designation ran from the corner of 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp . US 16 and Byp . US 131 on 28th Street . At East Beltline Avenue , Byp . US 131 / Byp . M-21 turned north back to M-21 . M-21A in Flint was turned over to local control in 1948 , decommissioning the number . The Byp . M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953 . The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus . M-21 instead . A bypass of Zeeland opened in 1958 , rerouting M-21 around the town . The I-196 freeway opened through Grand Rapids in 1964 , and M-21 was routed along the freeway between Chicago Drive in Grandville and downtown , using I-96 to complete the connection to its previous routing on Fulton Street . The first freeway segment of M-21 on the east end was built from Wadhams to Port Huron in 1966 . A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971 . M-21 was routed down M-13 to the new freeway where it joined the M-78 designation from M-13 east . The section of M-21 formerly between M-13 and Bus . M-54 was redesignated M-56 . The M-78 designation was replaced by I-69 in 1973 after I-69 was extended north from Charlotte . The 1974 completion of I-196 meant the truncation of M-21 to end in Grand Rapids . At the time , M-21 was extended along Fulton Street to the East Beltline , and the business loop was truncated into a spur route redesignated BS I-196 . The remaining segment of freeway connecting Flint with Port Huron opened in 1984 as I-69 , and M-21 was shortened to Flint . M-56 was replaced by M-21 at this time as well . The former M-21 in Port Huron became BL I-69 , and the remainder was turned back to local control . Michigan legislators have proposed naming the section of highway in Genesee County after University of Alabama tailback Mark Ingram . The state senate approved the measure on November 4 , 2010 , and the bill moved to the state house for approval . The bill failed to pass the state house during the session . = = Major intersections = = = = Related trunklines = = = = = M-21A = = = M-21A was an alternate route for M-21 near Flint .

The highway started at the intersection with M-13 on the Shiawassee \u2013 Genesee county line west of Flint . From there , it followed Corunna Road eastward through rural areas of Genesee County . Today , the area is farm fields through Clayton Township , and it Flint Township it is more suburban . The highway intersected the I-75 / US 10 / US 23 freeway just west of Flint 's city line . Once in Flint , M-56 turned northeasterly onto Court Street . At an intersection with Saginaw Street , the highway turned southeasterly and then ended at the I-69 / M-21 freeway . In 1971 , M-21 was rerouted in the Flint area . After the change , it turns south along M-13 on the Shiawassee \u2013 Genesee county line to the M-78 freeway and then routed eastward to replace M-78 . The former of M-21 on the western side of the county into downtown was redesignated M-56 . When the M-21 designation was replaced with the I-69 designation in 1984 , the M-56 designation was retired and M-21 was restored in its place . Major intersections",
                "Maryland Route 404 = Maryland Route 404 ( MD 404 ) is a major highway on Maryland 's Eastern Shore in the United States . It runs 24.61 miles ( 39.61 km ) from MD 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne 's and Talbot counties , southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County , where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 ( DE 404 ) to Nassau ( near Rehoboth Beach ) . The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) with the Delaware Beaches . Along the way , MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne , Hillsboro , and Denton . The road is a two-lane undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of the bypass around Denton and a section near Hillsboro , which is a four-lane divided highway . MD 404 was designated by 1933 to run from Matapeake ( where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis ) , east along present-day MD 8 , US 50 , and MD 662 to Wye Mills , where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border . By 1946 , the route \u2019 s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis , where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry . The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949 , having been replaced with US 50 west of there . The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987 . Since MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches , the road has a high accident rate . To improve on this situation , the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway . A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $ 7.7 million for widening as a part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009 . = = Route description = = MD 404 begins at an intersection with MD 662 ( Old Wye Mills Road ) in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne 's and Talbot Counties , heading to the east on Queen Anne 's Highway , a two-lane undivided road . It heads east through farmland along the Queen Anne 's / Talbot County border before reaching an intersection with US 50 ( Ocean Gateway ) . Upon crossing US 50 , MD 404 becomes a part of the main route between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches . MD 404 continues east through farmland with some residences and wooded areas as a two-lane road , approaching the town of Queen Anne . Further east , Old Queen Anne Road splits from MD 404 , with MD 404 crossing entirely into Queen Anne 's County . It resumes east through some farmland before coming to an intersection with MD 309 ( Starr Road ) . Past MD 309 , the route intersects the northern terminus of MD 303 ( Main Street ) , which intersects the route as a northbound-only road that provides access to eastbound MD 404 . From MD 303 , the road heads into wooded areas adjacent to Tuckahoe State Park before crossing the Tuckahoe Creek . MD 404 enters Caroline County upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek , where it becomes Shore Highway . It widens into a four-lane divided highway and emerges from the woods into agricultural areas , intersecting MD 480 ( Ridgely Road ) near Hillsboro . Past that intersection , the route heads through a mix of woods and residences , narrowing back into a two-lane undivided road , before intersecting MD 404 Alt . ( Hillsboro Road ) , where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland . Unsigned MD 485 ( Saathoff Road ) loops to the south of MD 404 , returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of MD 312 ( Downes Station Road ) . The route continues to the southeast through farms , heading toward Denton . As the road approaches Denton , it widens into a four-lane divided highway that heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses . MD 404 Bus . ( Meeting House Road ) splits from MD 404 to head through the center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north . The route continues east through fields before intersecting MD 328 ( New Bridge Road ) . Past this intersection , MD 404 crosses over the Choptank River . It continues east as a limited-access road with a diamond interchange with MD 313 ( Greensboro Road ) and unsigned MD 619 ( Sixth Street ) , where some businesses are located . MD 313 forms a concurrency with MD 404 and the two routes turn south , heading along the eastern side of Denton through woodland and then past residential neighborhoods . It turns to the southwest , heading into woods and intersecting MD 404 Bus . ( Franklin Street / Gay Street ) at an at-grade intersection . MD 313 and MD 404 continue as a surface road that turns south and heads through some commercial areas . The road heads south into farmland , passing by Martinak State Park . It crosses over Watts Creek and comes to an intersection with MD 16 ( Harmony Road ) , with that route joining MD 313 and MD 404 for a three-way concurrency . The three routes continue southeast , narrowing into a two-lane undivided road that heads through a mix of woods and farms with some homes . The road turns more to the east-southeast , with MD 313 splitting from MD 16 and MD 404 by heading south on Federalsburg Highway in Andersontown . The road turns southeast and in a short distance , MD 16 splits from MD 404 by heading east on Greenwood Road . Past this intersection , MD 404 continues southeast through farmland and woodland to the Delaware border , where the road continues as DE 404 , which runs east to an intersection with DE 1 in Five Points ( near Rehoboth Beach ) . MD 404 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length except for the portion from MD 662 to US 50 in Wye Mills . = = History = = By 1921 , what would become MD 404 was built as a state highway within Queen Anne , from Hillsboro to a point between Hillsboro and Denton , and between West Denton and Denton . The state highway between Queen Anne and Denton was completed by 1927 . By 1933 , MD 404 was designated onto a state highway between Matapeake , where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County , and the Delaware border southeast of Denton . The route headed east across Kent Island to Queenstown , where it turned southeast to Wye Mills and continued east through Queen Anne , Hillsboro , and Denton . By 1946 , the route 's western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis in Anne Arundel County , crossing the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry , roughly where the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is now , and continuing west through Skidmore to MD 2 . MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Wye Mills in 1948 , with part of the former alignment through the community becoming part of MD 662 . A year later , the western terminus of MD 404 was moved to MD 662 in Wye Mills . West of Wye Mills , the route was replaced by an extended US 50 . The former alignment of MD 404 west of Wye Mills is now the US 50 approaches to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge , with the part between Matapeake and Stevensville now a part of MD 8 . In 1950 , MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro to the north , with the former alignment now MD 404 Alt . A portion of the route between Hillsboro and Denton was bypassed in 1960 . This former alignment of MD 404 is now known as Saathoff Road and has the unsigned MD 485 designation . In 1972 , MD 404 and MD 313 were relocated to a one-way pair , eastbound Franklin Street and westbound Gay Street , through Denton . The routes previously headed south out of Denton on Sixth Street and Fifth Avenue . The former alignment along Sixth Street became MD 619 by 1978 . In the early 1980s , construction began to widen MD 404 to a divided highway . By 1985 , construction was underway for the four-lane divided bypass of Denton between MD 404 west of Denton and MD 313 north of Denton . In 1987 , MD 313 and MD 404 were rerouted to bypass Denton along the newly completed four-lane divided bypass . The former alignment of MD 404 through Denton became MD 404 Bus . The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route . This project received $ 3 million from the federal government in 2001 . On May 29 , 2011 , the Route 404 Memorial Garden , located near Denton , was dedicated , honoring those who were killed in car accidents along MD 404 . The memorial consists of a flagpole surrounded by a circular path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along the route . = = Future = = The Maryland State Highway Administration is working on improvements to MD 404 in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts , notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway . The primary motive behind the widening is the high accident rate that plagues the two-lane road , brought on by beach traffic . As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17 , 2009 , $ 7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County , creating 221 jobs . On May 21 , 2014 , groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road . The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $ 39 million . On June 25 , 2015 , Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton , among other projects across the state .

The route runs along the former alignment of MD 404 through the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro . The route begins at an intersection with MD 309 ( Cordova Road ) near Queen Anne , Talbot County , where it heads east on two-lane undivided Millsboro Denton Road . West of MD 309 , Old Queen Anne Road continues west to MD 404 . MD 404 Alt. passes through woodland , crossing under the abandoned Chesapeake Railroad before coming to MD 303 ( Lewistown Road ) . At this point , the route turns north to form a concurrency with MD 303 along Talbot Avenue , and the two routes enter Queen Anne as it turns to the east . MD 303 splits from MD 404 Alternate by turning north on Main Street , while MD 404 Alt. continues east past homes , intersecting MD 518 ( First Street ) . As the road runs a short distance to the south of the Tuckahoe Creek , there is an industrial building on the south side of the road . Upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek , MD 404 Alt. enters Hillsboro in Caroline County and becomes Hillsboro Road . The route continues through residential areas of the town .

                "U.S. Route 12 in Michigan = US Highway 12 ( US 12 ) is a US Highway that runs from Aberdeen , Washington , to Detroit , Michigan . In Michigan it runs for 210 miles ( 338 km ) between New Buffalo and Detroit as a state trunkline highway and Pure Michigan Byway . On its western end , the highway is mostly a two-lane road that runs through the southern tier of counties roughly parallel to the Indiana state line . It forms part of the Niles Bypass , a four-lane expressway south of Niles in the southwestern part of the state , and it runs concurrently with the Interstate 94 ( I-94 ) freeway around the south side of Ypsilanti in the southeastern . In between Coldwater and the Ann Arbor area , the highway angles northeasterly and passes the Michigan International Speedway . East of Ypsilanti , US 12 follows a divided highway routing on Michigan Avenue into Detroit , where it terminates at an intersection with Cass Avenue . When US 12 was designated in Michigan on November 11 , 1926 , along with the other original US Highways , it ran along a more northerly course . It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state , the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail , a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area . It entered from Indiana as it does now , but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor \u2013 St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo , Battle Creek and Jackson . In the Ann Arbor area , it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown . In the 1940s and 1950s , sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways . Starting in 1959 , these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I-94 , and in January 1962 , US 12 was shifted to replace US Highway 112 ( US 112 ) . That highway , when it was designated in 1926 replaced the original M-23 along the Chicago Road . Later , US 112 replaced the first M-151 when the former was extended to New Buffalo in the mid-1930s . Since 1962 , the highway has remained relatively unchanged aside from minor truncations in the city of Detroit . US 112 previously had two business loops , both of which were renumbered Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) in 1962 . In 2010 , the Niles business loop was decommissioned , but the one in Ypsilanti remains . One section of the former US 112 was renumbered US 112S for a few years in the 1930s . = = Route description = = Between the state line near Michiana and the interchange with I-94 near New Buffalo , US 12 forms a portion of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) . The full length of the highway in the state is also a Pure Michigan Historic Byway . Outside of the various cities , most of US 12 is a rural , two-lane state highway . One section runs concurrently with I-94 south of Ypsilanti . From there eastward , the US 12 is a divided highway and then a boulevard into the Detroit area . The entire length of the highway east of Coldwater is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the US 's economy , defense , and mobility . = = = Southwest Michigan = = = US 12 enters the state of Michigan southwest of New Buffalo near the town of Michiana . The highway runs a bit inland and parallel to the Lake Michigan shore on Red Arrow Highway past the community of Grand Beach before turning eastward away from the lake on the north side of New Buffalo . US 12 intersects I-94 less than a mile east of this turn and continues due east along Pulaski Highway through rural farmland . The highway is the main east \u2013 west street as it crosses through Three Oaks in southern Berrien County . East of Galien , the highway dips southward around Dayton Lake before passing south of Buchanan . The highway continues eastward , intersecting US 31 ( St. Joseph Valley Parkway ) near Niles . East of that freeway , US 12 expands into an expressway as the Niles Bypass . This bypass intersects M-139 , crosses the St. Joseph River and intersects M-51 on the south side of Niles . US 12 turns northeasterly along the bypass east of downtown and then departs to the southeast at an interchange with Main Street and M-60 just across the county line with Cass County . Continuing through southern Cass County , US 12 runs roughly parallel to the state line . It turns northeasterly to run into Edwardsburg , where it intersects M-62 . The highway turns southeasterly and runs to the south of Eagle Lake before entering the community of Adamsville . The highway continues on this southeasterly course until it intersects the former M-205 and M-217 ( Michiana Parkway ) near Union and turns to the northeast . US 12 intersects the southern end of M-40 before crossing into St. Joseph County at the eastern crossing of the St. Joseph River . On the eastern side of the river , US 12 enters Mottville and intersects M-103 . The highway continues as Chicago Road through farmland and intersects US 131 near White Pigeon . It runs along the south side of Klinger Lake and continues to a junction with M-66 in Sturgis ; the two highways run concurrently for about eight blocks through town . East of Sturgis , US 12 turns northeasterly into Branch County . Still named Chicago Road , it passes through Bronson and Batavia . Northeast of Batavia , US 12 intersects the eastern end of M-86 near Branch County Memorial Airport .

The trunkline continues northeasterly through northern Hillsdale County , crossing the South Branch of the Kalamazoo River in Moscow . US 12 runs along the south side of Lake LeAnn in Somerset Center in the northeastern corner of the county . East of Somerset , the highway crosses into northern Lenawee County . Immediately east of the Lenawee County line , US 12 intersects US 127 in the Irish Hills region . South of Brooklyn in Cambridge Junction , it passes the Michigan International Speedway and crosses the River Raisin next to a junction with M-50 . East of the racetrack , the highway meanders through an area dotted by several smaller lakes until it intersects M-124 at Walter J. Hayes State Park . Continuing as Michigan Avenue , US 12 angles northeasterly from the park until it hits the Lenawee \u2013 Washtenaw county line . The highway follows the line for several miles before reentering Lenawee County . It continues through an intersection with M-52 and into Clinton before turning northeasterly and fully crossing into Washtenaw County . In Washtenaw County , US 12 passes through Benton in a rural southern section of the county . At Saline , the highway enters the suburban edge of the Ann Arbor \u2013 Ypsilanti metro area . US 12 follows Michigan Avenue northeasterly through Saline and across an interchange with US 23 before intersecting I-94 in Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships . US 12 leaves Michigan Avenue to follow I-94 at that freeway 's exit 181 ; Michigan Avenue continues into downtown Ypsilanti as a city street . I-94 / US 12 skirts around the south side of the city and intersects the western end of Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) at Huron Street south of downtown . The freeway continues around the south side of the city and rounds the north end of Ford Lake . It is bounded by residential neighborhoods , and it crosses the Huron River on the eastern side of Ypsilanti . Near the Willow Run industrial complex and airport , US 12 separates from I-94 and turns northeasterly along an expressway on the north side of the airport . There are three interchanges , including one for the eastern end of M-17 before US 12 crosses into Wayne County and intersects the eastern end of Bus . US 12 . = = = East into Detroit = = = Once US 12 intersects the eastern end of its business loop , it returns to Michigan Avenue for the remainder of its routing in the state . The roadway is a boulevard in this area , a street divided by a central median . It runs through Canton Township and parallel to the Lower River Rouge . US 12 intersects I-275 on the eastern side of the township before crossing into Wayne . The highway is bounded by a mix of industrial and commercial properties in suburban Metro Detroit . In downtown Wayne , the two sides of Michigan Avenue split apart , surrounding the central business district of the city and separated by two to three city blocks . East of this split , Michigan Avenue crosses a section of Westland before entering Inkster . In Dearborn , US 12 intersects US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) at an interchange on the western side of the city , and M-39 ( Southfield Freeway ) on the eastern side near the River Rouge crossing and Greenfield Village . On the Dearborn \u2013 Detroit city border , US 12 pass through a complex interchange with I-94 ( Edsel Ford Freeway ) and M-153 ( Ford Road / Wyoming Avenue ) . Michigan Avenue continues northeasterly parallel to I-94 for a short distance before it turns due east . Once it makes the direction change , it forms the 0 Mile of Detroit 's Mile Road System . US 12 continues through residential areas on Detroit 's West Side , passing through the interchange that connects I-75 with I-96 's eastern terminus near the Ambassador Bridge . The highway runs through Corktown , Detroit and beside the site of the former Tiger Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull . East of the former stadium , US 12 crosses M-10 ( Lodge Freeway ) near the MGM Grand Detroit casino . East of M-10 , Michigan Avenue enters Downtown Detroit . At the corner of Michigan and Cass , US 12 ends while Michigan Avenue continues several blocks further to terminate at Campus Martius Park at Woodward Avenue . = = History = = = = = Before 1926 = = = The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails . Two of these trails are relevant to US 12 . The St. Joseph Trail ran between the Benton Harbor \u2013 St. Joseph area and Detroit by way of what is now Kalamazoo , Battle Creek , Jackson and Ann Arbor . The second , the Sauk Trail , ran further south through what is now Niles , and Coldwater to the Ann Arbor area . The Town of Detroit created 120-foot-wide ( 37 m ) rights-of-way for the principal streets of the city in 1805 , including Michigan Avenue . This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit , with a mandate from the territorial governor to improve on the previous plan . The wide width of the avenues was an emulation of the street plan for Washington , DC , and intended to make Detroit the \" Paris of the West \" . The southern of these two Indian trails later became the Chicago Road . Father Gabriel Richard , the first priest to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives , petitioned Congress to fund a highway between Detroit and Chicago in March 1824 . A year later , the road was established in federal law , and it was surveyed by the end of 1825 . Construction started in 1829 , and the road was finished across Michigan in 1833 . The northern Indian trail was established as an unnamed territorial road in 1829 . The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13 , 1913 , by an act of the Michigan Legislature ; at the time , two of the system 's divisions corresponded to the original US 12 . Division 5 had a segment from New Buffalo to Benton Harbor and Watervliet while Division 6 connected Watervliet through Kalamazoo , Jackson and Ann Arbor to Detroit . No divisions corresponded to the future US 112 . In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) signposted the highway system for the first time , and the future US 12 corridor was assigned two numbers . From the state line north through Benton Harbor to Watervliet , it carried the original M-11 designation , and from Watervliet eastward it was the original M-17 . From Dearborn into Detroit , the original M-10 ran concurrently along M-17 . The future US 112 along the Chicago Road had two different numbers in the original highway plan . Between New Buffalo and Niles , the highway was numbered M-60 , and from Union to Ypsilanti , it was M-23 . East of Ypsilanti , the corridor was part of M-17 and M-10 . In November 1926 , these two highway corridors were renumbered as part of the United States Numbered Highway System . = = = Original US Highway : 1926 \u2013 62 = = = On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) , and US 12 was the designation assigned to a highway running northeasterly from Indiana near Lake Michigan to Benton Harbor \u2013 St. Joseph and turning east to Detroit through Kalamazoo , Jackson and Ann Arbor . This designation replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 through the southern part of the state . By the end of the next year , the MSHD rerouted the highway between Sawyer and Stevensville , and Downtown Stevensville was bypassed in 1928 . Additional work to fully bypass Stevensville was finished in 1929 . In 1931 , the original routing of US 12 along a section of Michigan Avenue between Kalamazoo and Comstock was renumbered US 12A , and a new routing along King Highway south of the original opened . By 1936 , another US 12A debuted in Battle Creek , and by the end of the year , the main highway was rerouted between Augusta and Battle Creek . Another new segment of highway opened that same year east of Jackson , bypassing Leoni and Grass Lake to the north . This new bypass was extended eastward from Sylvan to bypass Chelsea to the south the following year , filling a gap in \" super highway \" segments between Jackson and Ann Arbor . The last routing change in the 1930s was the opening of Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo , after which US 12 was rerouted to follow it west of downtown . In 1940 , a southern bypass of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue , and the former routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became a Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) . In late 1951 or early 1952 , a northerly bypass of Jackson opened , and the former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus . US 12 . By the next year , the western half of the Jackson bypass opened , including a bypass of Parma . In 1954 , a new bypass of Kalamazoo and Galesburg opened ; US 12 was rerouted to follow the new highway while M-96 replaced part of the old route and the US 12A in the area . In 1956 , several changes were made to US 12 's routing . A southern bypass of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti was converted to a freeway . US 12 was rerouted to follow the bypass , supplanting the M-17 and Bypass US 112 designations used previously on the bypass . US 112 was also rerouted , and it runs concurrently with US 12 along the bypass . The former route of US 12 along Plymouth Road from Ann Arbor east to Detroit was renumbered M-14 , and the M-112 designation on the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways was replaced by US 12 . At the same time as these changes were made , the Jackson bypass was upgraded to a full freeway . By the middle of 1958 , the Kalamazoo bypass was converted to a full freeway . Previously delayed so that the designations could be finalized , the MSHD started numbering its Interstate Highways in 1959 , adding I-94 to the sections of US 12 freeway . Later that year , additional segments of I-94 / US 12 were opened , starting with a 10-mile ( 16 km ) section from Hartford to Coloma , then another from Paw Paw to Kalamazoo which connected with a segment between Galesburg to Battle Creek . The overall 45-mile ( 72 km ) section from Paw Paw to Battle Creek was dedicated on December 7 , 1959 . By the middle of 1960 , US 12 followed the I-94 freeway from Coloma to Watervliet and from Paw Paw to the east side of Jackson . It was also routed along the freeway from the west side of Ann Arbor into Detroit , where it followed the southern end of the Lodge Freeway . By the middle of 1961 , the Watervliet \u2013 Paw Paw and Jackson \u2013 Ann Arbor freeway gaps were completed , and the freeway was extended westward to Stevensville ; By the end of the year , I-94 / US 12 extended all the way to New Buffalo . In January 1962 , the state made the biggest rerouting change of all to US 12 : the designation was removed from the I-94 freeway from New Buffalo to Detroit and shifted to completely replace US 112 . = = = US Highway 112 : 1926 \u2013 62 = = = In 1925 , US 112 was originally proposed to run from Oshkosh to Fremont , Wisconsin , on what later became U.S. Route 110 . When it was initially designated in November 1926 , US 112 made a sharp turn to the southwest to connect to US 20 in Elkhart , Indiana . In 1931 , a new trunkline highway was designated between M-60 at Niles and US 112 at Union . This highway was numbered M-151 . In 1933 , the section of US 112 from Union to Elkhart was renumbered US 112S . M-151 and US 112S each lasted until 1935 when US 112 was extended to replace M-151 . US 112 was also extended to run concurrently with M-60 to New Buffalo , and US 112S was renumbered M-205 . In 1936 , the section of US 112 along Michigan Avenue east of Ypsilanti was expanded into a \" super highway \" . In 1955 , a realignment of US 127 in southern Jackson County removed a short concurrency with US 112 from Somerset Center in Hillsdale County and the current intersection in northwestern Lenawee County . On December 1 , 1956 , the highway department opened the first 6.6 miles ( 10.6 km ) of a new four-lane divided highway around the south side of Niles , with the final 1.6 miles ( 2.6 km ) of the bypass opening early the next year . Consequently , they converted the former route through town into a business loop numbered Bus . US 112 back to US 112 / M-60 . At the end of the decade , another highway concurrency was removed when US 131 was realigned to run directly south of US 112 to the state line instead of running concurrently along US 112 between Mottville and White Pigeon . In January 1962 , the US 112 designation was decommissioned when US 12 was shifted off the I-94 freeway to replace US 112 . = = = After 1962 = = = After US 12 replaced US 112 , the Bus . US 12 routes were renumbered as Business Loop I-94 , and the two Bus . US 112s were renumbered to Bus . US 12 . In 1966 , the state truncated M-60 and removed it as a concurrent designation along US 12 between New Buffalo and Niles . In October 2000 , the state proposed changing jurisdiction of several highways near Campus Martius Park in Detroit , and US 12 was shortened by four city blocks the next year to end along Michigan Avenue at Griswold Street . This would be shortened again in 2005 to Michigan Avenue and Cass Avenue . = = Memorial highway and byway names = = The roads that have carried US 12 in Michigan have been given a number of memorial highway names . In 1922 , after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis , that street name took on a pejorative connotation . The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name . It was already labeled the Michigan \u2013 Detroit \u2013 Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time , so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country . Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue , so that is what the paper suggested for a new name . Albion was the first community to change the name of its street after the paper followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924 , Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929 . In 1952 , US 12 was dedicated to the 32nd Infantry Division . The division used a red arrow as its insignia to symbolize how they pierced the German Hindenburg Line during World War I and Japanese defenses during World War II . The soldiers who composed the division were drawn from the Michigan and Wisconsin National Guards . After other proposals failed , US 12 was named the Red Arrow Highway on August 30 , 1952 , and dedicated on March 22 , 1953 . Jurisdiction of most of the roadways that composed US 12 at that time has passed to local governments as I-94 was built , but the highway still bears that name in Berrien County . Count Casimir Pulaski was a Polish-born noble and soldier who fought on the side of the Americans during the Revolutionary War . He was appointed a brigadier general on the recommendations of George Washington and later became known as the \" Father of the American Cavalry \" . He was severely wounded during the Siege of Savannah and died while being treated on the brigantine Wasp . The route of US 112 was designated the Pulaski Memorial Highway by Public Act 11 of 1953 and formally dedicated in Detroit on October 4 , 1953 . The segment of what is now US 12 in Berrien County still bears this name . US 12 has also been designated as the Iron Brigade Memorial Highway , a designation which it also has in Indiana , Illinois and Wisconsin . The name honors the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment , part of the Iron Brigade from the American Civil War . The regiment lost more troops than any other on the Union side during the war and provided the military escort for Abraham Lincoln 's funeral in Springfield , Illinois . The unit traveled along the Chicago Road to join the war effort . The highway was dedicated in twin ceremonies in New Buffalo on October 9 , 1994 , and in Detroit on November 11 , 1995 , to the Iron Brigade . In 1986 , the Michigan Department of Transportation consulted with its counterparts in Wisconsin ( WisDOT ) , Minnesota ( Mn / DOT ) and Ontario ( Ministry of Transportation of Ontario , MTO ) about the formation of a circle tour around Lake Superior . The Lake Michigan Circle Tour was signed on maps by 1988 . In May 2001 , the section of US 12 through Saline was designated a Michigan Historic Heritage Route . The segment through Clinton was given the same status in October 2002 . On June 9 , 2004 , the full length of US 12 was dedicated as the US 12 Heritage Trail . In December 2014 , this became a Pure Michigan Byway when Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation renaming the Michigan Heritage Route System to the Pure Michigan Byway System . = = Major intersections = = = = Related routes = = = = = Niles business loop = = = Business US Highway 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) was a business route running in Niles . The western terminus was at the corner of West Chicago Road and US 12 ( Pulaski Highway ) east of the US 12 / US 31 interchange . From there , the business loop followed Chicago Road northeasterly through residential areas on the west side of town . Bus . US 12 turned north along Lincoln Avenue and then east on Main Street , crossing the St. Joseph River . The loop intersected the southern end of M-139 at Front Street one block east of the river in downtown Niles . Four blocks further east , Bus . US 12 met M-51 . The two highways merged along Main Street and then turned south along 11th Street at an intersection that also marks the western terminus of Bus . M-60 ( Oak Street ) . Bus . US 12 / M-51 continued south along 11th Street to the corner of US 12 ( Pulaski Highway ) and M-51 ( South 11th Street ) where the business loop terminated . The trunkline was first designated in 1956 as a business route of US 112 . At that time , US 112 and M-60 were transferred to a bypass south of Niles . When US 112 was decommissioned in January 1962 , Bus . US 112 was redesignated Bus . US 12 to match the new US 12 designation . In 1986 , US 33 was truncated in Michigan to end at US 12 . Bus . US 12 was rerouted in Niles to replace US 33 through town ; Bus . US 31 was added a year later when the signage was updated in the area . In 1998 , US 33 was removed from Michigan completely . At this time , M-51 was extended over former US 33 and replaced part of the Bus . US 31 designation in Niles . On March 5 , 2010 , the segment of Bus . US 12 between Bus . US 31 and M-51 was turned over to local control . In April 2010 the Bus . US 12 designation was retired when an extended M-139 replaced it from the local control section southwestward prior to maps and signage being changed .

The loop starts at exit 183 on I-94 / US 12 south of downtown Ypsilanti and runs northward along the one-way pairing of Huron Street ( northbound ) and Hamilton Street ( southbound ) . At the intersection with Michigan Avenue in downtown , the two directions reunite and turn eastward , merging onto M-17 in the process . Michigan Avenue crosses the Huron River and continues due east until an intersection at Prospect Street where it turns northeasterly . M-17 separates from Bus . US 12 at Ecorse Road , and Michigan Avenue continues through commercial areas , exiting the city of Ypsilanti . Once Bus . US 12 crosses from Washtenaw County into Wayne County , it expands into a boulevard with Michigan left turns . Just north of the Willow Run industrial complex , Bus . US 12 terminates where US 12 merges onto Michigan Avenue . In 1942 or 1943 , Ypsilanti was bypassed by a Bypass US 112 ( Byp . US 112 ) . US 112 continued to run along its routing in Ypsilanti . The first business loop in Ypsilanti was created in 1956 when US 112 was realigned to bypass downtown along the former Byp . US 112 . The former route through downtown was then numbered Bus .

DE 9 continues into residential areas and crosses under I-95 / US 202 , with access to that road provided by northbound North Adams Street and southbound North Jackson Street . Past this , the road heads through more of the city before reaching the Little Italy neighborhood . Here , DE 9 intersects the eastbound direction of DE 2 ( North Lincoln Street ) before coming to its northern terminus at the westbound direction of DE 2 ( North Union Street ) . Much of DE 9 is designated as part of the Delaware Byways system . From the southern terminus north to New Castle , DE 9 is designated as the Delaware 's Bayshore Byway ( formerly Route 9 Coastal Heritage Byway ) , a road that is noted for following the Delaware River and Delaware Bay shoreline . The sections of the route between DE 299 east of Odessa and 7th Street southwest of New Castle , Wilmington Road north of New Castle and A Street in Wilmington , and along 4th Street in Wilmington between Swedes Landing Road and US 13 Bus. and Market and West streets are part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway . DE 9 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 19,064 vehicles at the intersection between East 6th Street and New Castle Avenue in New Castle to a low of 258 vehicles at the intersection with Cedar Swamp Road in southeastern New Castle County . The portion of DE 9 concurrent with DE 273 is part of the National Highway System . = = History = = The section of the present route between New Castle and Wilmington was constructed as the New Castle and Wilmington Turnpike , a private turnpike , in 1813 . What would become DE 9 originally existed as a county road by 1920 . Four years later , the road between Leipsic and Smyrna was upgraded to a state highway . In addition , the current alignment of DE 9 around Taylors Bridge and between Delaware City and Wilmington was paved . In 1931 , what would become DE 9 was upgraded to a state highway between Bay Road and Little Creek and between Port Penn and Delaware City . A year later , the road became a state highway between Delaware City and Wilmington . By this time , what would become DE 9 between Little Creek and Leipsic was upgraded to a state highway . DE 9 was designated to run from US 113 ( now DE 1 ) west of Kitts Hummock north to US 13 in Smyrna by 1936 , following its current alignment to Leipsic and Smyrna-Leipsic Road to Smyrna . By 1942 , what is now DE 9 between the Taylors Bridge area and Port Penn was paved . In 1956 , New Castle Avenue was widened to a four-lane divided highway between Landers Lane and Rogers Corner . DE 9 was extended north to US 13 Alt . ( now US 13 ) in Wilmington by 1959 , being rerouted off Smyrna-Leipsic Road to follow its current alignment to New Castle , passing through that city on 6th Street before continuing along its current alignment to Wilmington . At this point , the entire route was paved . The current Reedy Point Bridge carrying DE 9 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal was completed in 1968 . By 1971 , DE 9 was extended north to its current terminus at DE 2 . DE 9 was realigned to bypass New Castle by 1984 by following Washington Street and DE 273 . The intersection at the southern terminus with DE 1 was rebuilt into an interchange in 2009 . The Delaware State Highway Department recommended that DE 9 along the Delaware Bay and Delaware River be designated a scenic highway as far back as 1965 . In 2007 , the Route 9 Coastal Heritage Byway was nominated and designated as a Delaware Scenic and Historic Highway . = = Major intersections = = = = Bannered and suffixed routes = = = = = DE 9A = = = Delaware Route 9A ( DE 9A ) is a two- to four-lane road in Wilmington , Delaware that serves as the primary access route to the Port of Wilmington as well as provide access to I-495 .

                "M-52 ( Michigan highway ) = M-52 is a north \u2013 south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan . The southern terminus is on the Ohio border , where it continues as State Route 109 ( SR 109 ) . The highway passes through communities like Adrian , where it intersects US Highway 223 ( US 223 ) , Chelsea and Webberville along its 127.3-mile-long ( 204.9 km ) course . It crosses some major rivers , including the River Raisin and the Shiawassee . The section of the highway between M-50 and Manchester was built as a limited-access highway . M-52 's northern terminus is at M-46 , nine miles ( 14 km ) west of Saginaw . Adrian previously converted their downtown streets to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973 . The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings of the two state highways downtown . Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street , which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US 223 business loop . These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009 . M-52 is an original state trunkline highway , dating to the 1919 formation of the system . Other segments of the modern routing were designated M-92 and M-47 at the time . Extensions to M-52 supplanted M-92 completely and M-47 partially along their routings . These extensions completed the modern M-52 routing in the late 1960s . = = Route description = = M-52 starts at the Ohio state line as Adrian Highway in Fairfield Township , Lenawee County , where it is the continuation of SR 109 into Michigan . The highway runs north to Adrian where it intersects US Highway 223 ( US 223 ) at the city border with Madison Township . As the highway crosses the city line , it is concurrently designated Business US 223 ( Bus . US 223 ) along Main Street into downtown Adrian . Bus . US 223 / M-52 intersects Beecher Street , which carries M-34 to the latter 's eastern terminus in Adrian . After Beecher , Main Street turns north-northeast into the downtown area . In downtown Adrian , M-52 runs north along Main Street to Church Street . Since November 2009 , the one-way streets were converted back to two-way functionality . Both directions of M-52 now turn east along Church , then north along Broad Street . At Front Street , traffic is diverted west back to Main Street . Continuing north out of downtown Adrian , M-52 follows Main Street over the South Branch of the River Raisin and out of the city limits , where it once again becomes Adrian Highway . The highway curves from running north-northeast back to due north . West of the city of Tecumseh , the trunkline intersects M-50 . M-52 continues north as a limited-access highway . Access to and from the highway is limited to select cross roads only . Just south of the county line , the highway intersects with US 12 before crossing into Washtenaw County . The limited-access section of M-52 continues north through western Washtenaw County , where it ends in Manchester . M-52 turns west along Austin and City roads into the village . The trunkline continues along the banks of the north branch of the River Raisin on Riverside Drive before turning north out of town . Just south of Chelsea , M-52 crosses Interstate 94 ( I-94 ) . The highway continues through downtown Chelsea and turns northwesterly through the Waterloo State Recreation Area in the northwesternmost part of the county . The highway clips the corner of Jackson County , running for almost 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) through Waterloo Township before crossing into Ingham County south of Stockbridge . M-52 joins M-106 south of Stockbridge , and the two highways run together into the village . In downtown , M-106 turns east and M-52 turns west before heading north out of town . At the Stockbridge \u2013 White Oak township line , M-52 joins M-36 which follows the townships ' common border . The two highways run concurrently north into White Oak Township before M-36 turns west , ending the concurrency . In western Webberville , M-52 passes under I-96 and merges with M-43 at the latter 's eastern terminus . The two highways run north to , and turn west along , Grand River Avenue . At Perry Road , M-52 turns back north out of the village . The trunkline continues north into Shiawassee County and runs through Perry before crossing I-69 . Continuing north , M-52 curves northeasterly into downtown Owosso intersecting M-21 west of M-71 's western terminus . M-52 continues northward parallel to the Shiawassee River into Saginaw County . The trunkline runs through the community of Oakley before intersecting M-57 west of Chesaning . North of Chesaning , M-52 angles to the northeast into and through St. Charles , crossing the Shiawassee River west of the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge . The northern terminus of M-52 is an intersection with M-46 west of Saginaw in Thomas Township . = = History = = M-52 was first designated by July 1 , 1919 . The original routing started at the Ohio state line and ran north through Adrian to M-50 much as it does today . It turned east along M-50 into Tecumseh and then turned north to Clinton where it terminated . The remainder of the modern highway routing is either not part of the state trunkline system , or it is parts of other highways at this time , M-92 or M-47 . In 1954 , M-92 was extended southward to end in Clinton at the same intersection with US 112 where M-52 terminated . By July 1 , 1960 , M-92 's southern end was shifted westward , terminating west of Clinton at US 112 on a new roadway south of Manchester . M-52 was extended around 1962 north between M-50 and US 12 ( the former US 112 ) west of Tecumseh and Clinton . This extension ended at M-92 's terminus with US 12 . M-52 was then extended north supplanting the M-92 designation in its entirety . M-52 at this time runs north from the Ohio state line to Millville in southwestern Ingham County . In the late 1960s , Stockbridge Road between Webberville and Stockbridge was upgraded to state highway standards and uploaded from the county to the state . This construction was shown on the 1969 state map . When it was completed later that year , M-52 was extended northward a second time , to I-96 outside of Webberville . Where Stockbridge Road crossed I-96 , M-52 was continued north , supplanting M-47 through Webberville and north to the junction with M-46 west of Saginaw . This designation change shortened M-47 to its current southern terminus in Saginaw Township . In downtown Adrian , the highways previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets . This arrangement was similar to a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church , Broad , Front and Winter streets . The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street . Northbound traffic continued on Main Street , while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street . At Church Street , westbound Bus . US 223 / northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street . Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street , passing to the east of the downtown businesses . The designations were then routed west along Front Street . At Main Street , M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street . In the opposite direction , southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street . Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus . US 223 traffic one block west to Winter Street , which then turned down Winter . Westbound Bus . US 223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus . US 223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street . This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic . Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973 . = = Major intersections = =",

The southern terminus of the route is at the Washington , D.C. border in Friendship Heights , Montgomery County , where it continues south as Wisconsin Avenue into Washington . The northern terminus is just north of an overpass with Interstate 70 ( I-70 ) and U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) in the city of Frederick in Frederick County , where the road continues north through Frederick towards MD 26 . MD 355 serves as a major thoroughfare through Frederick and Montgomery counties , passing through Bethesda , Rockville , Gaithersburg , Germantown , Clarksburg , Hyattstown , Urbana , and Frederick , roughly parallel to I-270 . The southern portion of the route from the D.C. border to Germantown is a suburban four- to six-lane divided highway lined with many businesses . North of Germantown , the route is predominantly a two lane rural road until it reaches Frederick , where it passes through commercial areas in the southern part of the city . MD 355 is the original route of US 240 , which was planned in 1926 to run from Washington , D.C. north to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania ; however , the route was designated a part of US 15 north of Frederick . This route served as the primary connector linking Frederick and points west to Washington , D.C. During the 1950s , US 240 was relocated in stages to the Washington National Pike , a freeway between Bethesda and Frederick shared with I-70S ( now I-270 ) . MD 355 was designated onto the former alignment of US 240 between Bethesda and Frederick as each stage of freeway was built . MD 355 was also designated through Frederick along Market Street , which was the former alignment of US 15 through the city before it was moved to a bypass in 1959 . US 240 was decommissioned in 1972 , and MD 355 was extended south along the former US 240 to the Washington , D.C. border . In 2006 , the interchange with US 15 at the route \u2019 s northern terminus was removed , resulting in MD 355 ending just short of US 15 at a dead end . By 2009 , a four lane divided bypass of Urbana for MD 355 , funded by private developers , was completed . The former alignment of MD 355 through Urbana was designated as MD 355 Business ( MD 355 Bus . ) The same year , the portion of MD 355 north of I-70 was transferred to the city of Frederick and is no longer considered part of the route . = = Route description = = MD 355 is a part of the main National Highway System from the District of Columbia in Friendship Heights to I-495 in Bethesda .

MD 355 passes over I-70 / US 40 and ends just north of the overpass , with the road continuing north into Frederick as locally maintained Market Street . = = History = = The Rockville Pike portion of MD 355 dates back to colonial times and was used as an escape route from Washington during the War of 1812 as well as a route for settlers to travel from Montgomery County to developing areas north and west . In 1911 , a small portion of state highway leading northwest out of Rockville was completed , with the remainder between Rockville and Gaithersburg under contract . A state highway was proposed between Gaithersburg and Germantown . The state road between Gaithersburg and Germantown was finished by 1915 . By 1921 , the portions of state highway between the Washington , D.C. border and Rockville , to the northwest of Germantown , and between northwest of Urbana and Frederick were completed . At this time , a state highway was proposed between northwest of Germantown and northwest of Urbana . The state road was completed between Germantown and Clarksburg and through Urbana to a point southeast of the community by 1923 . The entire length of the state road connecting Washington , D.C. and Frederick was completed by 1927 . In the approved plan for the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , US 240 was planned to run from Washington , D.C. to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania via Frederick . In 1927 , US 240 was designated along the proposed 1926 route south of US 15 / US 40 in Frederick with the US 15 designation given to the road north of Frederick . In 1950 , US 240 was widened into a divided highway between the Washington , D.C. border and Bethesda . In 1947 , plans were made to construct a freeway , the Washington National Pike ( now I-270 ) , parallel to US 240 . In 1953 , the US 240 freeway was completed between MD 121 in Clarksburg and US 15 ( now MD 85 ) in Frederick . The former alignment of US 240 between Clarksburg and Frederick was designated as US 240 Alt . A year later , the freeway was extended down to MD 118 in Germantown . At this time , the original alignment between Germantown and Frederick was designated MD 355 , replacing what was US 240 between Germantown and Clarksburg and the entire length of US 240 Alt. between Clarksburg and Frederick . The US 240 freeway was extended south to MD 28 in Rockville in 1956 , and MD 355 was subsequently extended south along the former alignment to the MD 28 intersection in Rockville . Also , the US 240 freeway was completed from US 15 north to US 40 . In 1957 , US 240 was upgraded to a divided highway between Bethesda and Rockville . The US 240 freeway was extended south to Montrose Road in 1958 , resulting in MD 355 being extended south along the former alignment to Montrose Road . I-70S was designated onto the US 240 freeway in 1959 . In addition , MD 355 was extended north to US 15 north of Frederick , passing through the city on Market Street , the one-way pair of Market Street northbound and Bentz Street southbound in the downtown , and Market Street to the north of downtown . The route replaced US 15 / US 240 south of downtown Fredrick and US 15 north of downtown Frederick , with US 15 shifted to a bypass west of the city . In 1960 , I-70S / US 240 was extended south to the Capital Beltway , and MD 355 was extended south along former US 240 between Montrose Road and the Capital Beltway . In 1972 , the American Association of State Highway Officials approved for the US 240 designation to be removed . As a result , MD 355 was extended south along the former US 240 alignment to the Washington , D.C. border . MD 355 was widened into a divided highway between Rockville and Gaithersburg in 1977 . The divided highway was extended north from Gaithersburg to Germantown by 1997 . In 2006 , the northern terminus of MD 355 at the interchange with US 15 in Frederick was truncated to a dead end a short distance south of that route . In 2009 , the portion of MD 355 north of the I-70 overpass was transferred to the city of Frederick , with the MD 355 designation officially being removed from this stretch . In 2010 , an interchange was completed at Montrose Parkway . A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was constructed for MD 355 in the 2000s . The primary reason for constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community brought on by the construction of numerous shopping centers in the area , and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center . The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic . The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway . On October 30 , 2008 , construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80 . The bypass was completed by January 2009 , at which point MD 355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD 355 Bus . In 2013 , maintenance of the bypass of MD 355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state . = = Junction list = = = = Related routes = = = = = MD 355 Business = = = Maryland Route 355 Business ( MD 355 Bus . ) is the designation of a 1.06-mile ( 1.71 km ) business route of MD 355 in Urbana that runs along Urbana Pike .

It runs through wooded terrain on gently rolling hills . Between the western terminus at Michigan Avenue and the US 131 freeway in Manton , M-42 is concurrently designated with Bus . US 131 along Seventh Street . It runs east along Seventh Street to a folded diamond interchange at Exit 191 on US 131 east of downtown . Continuing east , it is known as North 16 \u00bd Road until it crosses the Wexford \u2013 Missaukee county line at Seeley Road approximately 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) east of the freeway . Here the road name changes to Mike and Tony Road before M-42 curves southeasterly crossing Morrisy Creek on West Walker Road .

The original highway routing started at M-13 in Manton and ran due west to Mesick . From there the highway turned north and met M-11 at Chums Corners . M-11 / M-42 ran concurrently northward into the City of Traverse City where M-42 ended . By May 1929 , M-42 was extended east to connect to Lake City . The highway was further extended before 1936 up the Old Mission Peninsula north of Traverse City . In the latter half of 1940 , the M-37 designation replace M-42 north of Mesick through Traverse City to Old Mission . The last sections of highway were paved in late 1951 and early 1952 .

                    "text": "Handley Page Victor = The Handley Page Victor is a British jet-powered strategic bomber , developed and produced by the Handley Page Aircraft Company , which served during the Cold War . It was the third and final of the V-bombers operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , the other two V-bombers being the Avro Vulcan and the Vickers Valiant . The Victor had been developed to perform as part of the United Kingdom \u2019 s airborne nuclear deterrent . In 1968 , the type was retired from the nuclear mission following the discovery of fatigue cracks , which had been exacerbated by the RAF 's adoption of a low-altitude flight profile to avoid interception . A number of Victors had received modifications to undertake the strategic reconnaissance role , employing a combination of radar , cameras , and other sensors . As the nuclear deterrence mission was given to the Royal Navy 's submarine-launched Polaris missiles in 1969 , a large V-bomber fleet was deemed surplus to requirements . Consequently , many of the surviving Victors were converted into aerial refuelling tankers . During the Falklands War , Victor tankers were notably used in the airborne logistics operation to repeatedly refuel Vulcan bombers on their way to and from the Black Buck raids . The Victor was the last of the V-bombers to be retired , the final aircraft being removed from service on 15 October 1993 . In its refuelling role , the type had been replaced by the Vickers VC10 and the Lockheed Tristar . = = Development = = = = = Origins = = = The origin of the Victor and the other V bombers is heavily linked with the early British atomic weapons programme and nuclear deterrent policies that developed in the aftermath of the Second World War . The atom bomb programme formally began with Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.1001 issued in August 1946 , which anticipated a government decision in January 1947 to authorise research and development work on atomic weapons , the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1946 ( McMahon Act ) having prohibited exporting atomic knowledge , even to countries that had collaborated on the Manhattan Project . OR.1001 envisaged a weapon not to exceed 24 ft 2 in ( 7.37 m ) in length , 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) in diameter , 10,000 lb ( 4,500 kg ) in weight , and suitable for release from 20,000 ft ( 6,100 m ) to 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) . At the same time , the Air Ministry drew up requirements for bombers to replace the existing piston-engined heavy bombers such as the Avro Lancaster and the new Avro Lincoln which equipped RAF Bomber Command . In January 1947 , the Ministry of Supply distributed Specification B.35 / 46 to aviation companies to satisfy Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.229 for \" a medium range bomber landplane capable of carrying one 10,000 lb ( 4,500 kg ) bomb to a target 1,500 nautical miles ( 1,700 mi ; 2,800 km ) from a base which may be anywhere in the world . \" A cruising speed of 500 knots ( 580 mph ; 930 km / h ) at heights between 35,000 ft ( 11,000 m ) and 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) was specified . The maximum weight when fully loaded ought not to exceed 100,000 lb ( 45,000 kg ) . The weapons load was to include a 10,000 lb \" Special gravity bomb \" ( i.e. a free-fall nuclear weapon ) , or over shorter ranges 20,000 lb ( 9,100 kg ) of conventional bombs . No defensive weapons were to be carried , the aircraft relying on its speed and height to avoid opposing fighters . The similar OR.230 required a \" long range bomber \" with a 2,000 nautical miles ( 2,300 mi ; 3,700 km ) radius of action at a height of 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) , a cruise speed of 575 mph ( 925 km / h ) , and a maximum weight of 200,000 lb ( 91,000 kg ) when fully loaded . Responses to OR.230 were received from Short Brothers , Bristol , and Handley Page ; however , the Air Ministry recognised that developing an aircraft to meet these stringent requirements would have been technically demanding and so expensive that the resulting bomber could only be purchased in small numbers . As a result , realising that the majority of likely targets would not require such a long range , a less demanding specification for a medium-range bomber , Air Ministry Specification B.35 / 46 was issued . This demanded the ability to carry the same 10,000 lb bomb-load to a target 1,500 nmi ( 1,725 mi , 2,800 km ) away at a height of 45,000 \u2013 50,000 ft ( 13,700 \u2013 15,200 m ) at a speed of 575 mph . = = = HP.80 = = = The design proposed by Handley Page in response to B.35 / 46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance , Handley Page 's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy , Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80 ; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip , to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed . Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs , which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead ; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted , full tailplane was adopted instead . The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages , particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behavior in flight . The HP.80 and Avro 's Type 698 were chosen as the best two of the proposed designs to B.35 / 46 , and orders for two prototypes of each were placed . It was recognised , however , that there were many unknowns associated with both designs , and an order was also placed for Vickers ' design , which became the Valiant . Although not fully meeting the requirements of the specification , the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier . The HP.80 's crescent wing was tested on a \u2153 -scale glider , the HP.87 , and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker , which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation . The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence . By the time the HP.88 was ready , the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative . The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme . Two HP.80 prototypes , WB771 and WB775 , were built . WB771 was broken down at the Handley Page factory at Radlett and transported by road to RAF Boscombe Down for its first flight ; bulldozers were used to clear the route and create paths around obstacles . Sections of the aircraft were hidden under wooden framing and tarpaulins printed with \" GELEYPANDHY / SOUTHAMPTON \" to make it appear as a boat hull in transit . GELEYPANDHY was an anagram of \" Handley Pyge \" marred by a signwriter 's error . On 24 December 1952 , piloted by Handley Page 's chief test pilot Hedley Hazelden , WB771 made its maiden flight , which lasted for a total of 17 minutes . Ten days later , the Air Ministry announced the aircraft 's official name to be Victor . The prototypes performed well ; however , several design failings led to the loss of WB771 on 14 July 1954 , when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield , causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew . Attached to the fin using three bolts , the tailplane was subject to considerably more stress than had been anticipated , and the three bolts failed due to metal fatigue . Additionally , the prototypes were considerably tail heavy due to the lack of equipment in the nose ; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes . Production Victors had a lengthened nose that also served to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes . The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the tailplane attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing . = = = Victor B.1 = = = Production B.1 Victors were powered by the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 turbojets rated at 11,000 lbf ( 49 kN ) , and was initially equipped with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon , re-equipping with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available , although Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs ( made available under the Project E programme ) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon . A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard by the addition of Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tailcone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) from 1958 to 1960 . On 1 June 1956 , a production Victor XA917 flown by test pilot Johnny Allam inadvertently exceeded the speed of sound after Allam let the nose drop slightly at a higher power setting . Allam noticed a cockpit indication of Mach 1.1 and ground observers from Watford to Banbury reported hearing a sonic boom . The Victor maintained stability throughout the event . Aviation author Andrew Brookes has claimed that Allam broke the sound barrier knowingly to demonstrate the Victor 's superiority to the earlier V-bombers . The Victor was the largest aircraft to have broken the sound barrier at that time . = = = Victor B.2 = = = The RAF required a higher ceiling for its bombers , and a number of proposals were considered for improved Victors to meet this demand . At first , Handley Page proposed use of the 14,000 lbf ( 62.4 kN ) Sapphire 9 engines to produce a \" Phase 2 \" bomber , to be followed by \" Phase 3 \" Victors with much greater wingspan ( 137 ft ( 42 m ) ) and powered by Bristol Siddeley Olympus turbojets or Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans . The Sapphire 9 was cancelled , however , and the heavily modified Phase 3 aircraft would have delayed production , so an interim \" Phase 2A \" Victor was proposed and accepted , to be powered by the Conway and having minimal modifications . The \" Phase 2A \" proposal was accepted by the Air Staff as the Victor B.2 , with Conway RCo.11 engines providing 17,250 lbf ( 76.7 kN ) . The new Conway engines required redesigned enlarged intakes to provide the greater airflow required . The wingtips were extended , increasing the wingspan to 120 ft ( 36.6 m ) . The B.2 featured distinctive retractable \" elephant ear \" intakes not found on the B.1 , located on the rear fuselage forward of the tail fin . These scoops fed ram air to Ram Air Turbines ( RAT ) which could provide electrical power during emergency situations , such as engine failure , during flight . The first prototype Victor B.2 , serial number XH668 made its maiden flight on 20 February 1959 . It had flown 100 hours by 20 August 1959 , when , while high-altitude engine tests were being carried out by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment ( A & AEE ) , it disappeared from radar screens , crashing into the sea off the coast of Pembrokeshire . An extensive search operation was initiated to locate and salvage the wreckage of XH668 to determine the cause of the crash . It took until November 1960 to recover most of the aircraft ; the accident investigation concluded that the starboard pitot head had failed inflight , causing the flight control system to force the aircraft into an unrecoverable dive . Only minor changes were needed to resolve this problem , allowing the Victor B.2 to enter service in February 1962 . = = = Further development = = = A total of 21 B.2 aircraft were upgraded to the B.2R standard with Conway RCo.17 engines ( 20,600 lbf or 92 kN thrust ) and facilities to carry a Blue Steel stand-off nuclear missile . Their wings were modified to incorporate two \" speed pods \" or \" K\u00fcchemann carrots \" . These were anti-shock bodies ; bulged fairings that reduced wave drag at transonic speeds ( see area rule ) , which were also used as a convenient place to house chaff dispensers . Handley Page proposed to build a further refined \" Phase 6 \" Victor , with more fuel and capable of carrying up to four Skybolt ( AGM-48 ) ballistic missiles on standing airborne patrols , but this proposal was rejected although it was agreed that some of the Victor B.2s on order would be fitted to carry two Skybolts . This plan was abandoned when the U.S. cancelled the whole Skybolt programme in 1963 . With the move to low-level penetration missions , the Victors were fitted with air-to-air refuelling probes above the cockpit and received large underwing fuel tanks . Nine B.2 aircraft were converted for strategic reconnaissance purposes to replace Valiants which had been withdrawn due to wing fatigue , with delivery beginning in July 1965 . These aircraft received a variety of cameras , a bomb bay-mounted radar mapping system and wing top sniffers to detect particles released from nuclear testing . Designated Victor SR.2 , a single aircraft could photograph the whole of the United Kingdom in a single two-hour sortie . Different camera configurations could be installed in the bomb bay , including up to four F49 survey cameras and up to eight F96 cameras could be fitted to take vertical or oblique daylight photography ; nighttime photography required the fitting of F89 cameras . = = = Aerial refuelling conversion = = = The withdrawal of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft , so the B.1 / 1A aircraft , now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role , were refitted for this duty . To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible , six B.1A aircraft were converted to B ( K ) .1A standard ( later redesignated B.1A ( K2P ) ) , receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried under each wing , while the bomb bay remained available for weapons . Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft , with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965 , and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965 . While these six aircraft provided a limited tanker capability suitable for refuelling fighters , the Mk 20A wing hosereels could only deliver fuel at a limited rate , and were not suitable for refuelling bombers . Work therefore continued to produce a definitive three-point tanker conversion of the Victor Mk.1. Fourteen further B.1A and 11 B.1 were fitted with two permanently fitted fuel tanks in the bomb bay , and a high-capacity Mk 17 centreline hose dispenser unit with three times the fuel flow rate as the wing reels , and were designated K.1A and K.1 respectively . The remaining B.2 aircraft were not as suited to the low-level mission profile that the RAF had adopted for carrying out strategic bombing missions as the Vulcan with its strong delta wing . This , combined with the switch of the nuclear deterrent from the RAF to the Royal Navy ( with the Polaris missile ) meant that the Victors were considered to be surplus to requirements . Hence , 24 B.2 were modified to K.2 standard . Similar to the K.1 / 1A conversions , the wing was trimmed to reduce stress and the bomb aimer 's nose glazing was plated over . During 1982 , the glazing was reintroduced on some aircraft , the former nose bomb aimer 's position having been used to mount F95 cameras in order to perform reconnaissance missions during the Falklands War . The K.2 could carry 91,000 lb ( 41,000 kg ) of fuel . It served in the tanker role until withdrawn in October 1993 . = = Design = = = = = Overview = = = The Victor was a futuristic-looking , streamlined aircraft , with four turbojet engines buried in the thick wing roots . Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes , and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar , cockpit , nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer 's position . It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes to act as an escape pod , but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950 . The Victor had a five-man crew , comprising the two pilots seated side-by-side and three rearward-facing crew , these being the navigator / plotter , the navigator / radar operator , and the air electronics officer ( AEO ) . Unlike the Vulcan and Valiant , the Victor 's pilots sat at the same level as the rest of the crew , thanks to a larger pressurised compartment that extended all the way to the nose . As with the other V-bombers , only the pilots were provided with ejection seats ; the three systems operators relying on \" explosive cushions \" inflated by a CO2 bottle that would help them from their seats and towards a traditional bail out in the event of high g-loading , but despite this , escape for the three backseaters was extremely difficult . While assigned to the nuclear delivery role , the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme , designed to protect the aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation . The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft ; paler variations of RAF 's roundels were also applied for this same reason . When the V-bombers were assigned to the low-level approach profile in the 1960s , the Victors were soon repainted in green / grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation ; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft . = = = Armaments and equipment = = = The Victor 's bomb bay was much larger than that of the Valiant and Vulcan , which allowed heavier weapon loads to be carried at the cost of range . As an alternative to the single \" 10,000 lb \" nuclear bomb as required by the specification , the bomb bay was designed to carry several conventional armaments , including a single 22,000 lb ( 10,000 kg ) Grand Slam or two 12,000 lb ( 5,500 kg ) Tallboy earthquake bombs , up to forty-eight 1,000 lb ( 450 kg ) bombs or thirty-nine 2,000 lb ( 900 kg ) sea mines . One proposed addition to the Victor were underwing panniers capable of carrying a further 28 1,000 lb bombs to supplement the main bomb bay , but this option was not pursued . In addition to a range of free-fall nuclear bombs , later Victor B.2s operated as missile carriers for standoff nuclear missiles such as Blue Steel ; it had been intended for the American Skybolt missile to be introduced ; however , development of Skybolt was cancelled . Target information for Blue Steel could be input during flight , as well in advance of the mission . It was reported that , with intensive work , a B.2 missile carrier could revert to carrying free-fall nuclear weapons or conventional munitions within 30 hours . Like its sibling V-Bombers , the Victor made use of the Navigational and Bombing System ( NBS ) ; a little-used optical sight had also been installed upon early aircraft . For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes , the Victor employed numerous radar systems . These included the H2S radar , the first airborne ground-scanning radar , and the Green Satin radar . Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus . Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from , or shared concepts with , those used on Handley Page 's preceding Halifax bomber . Operationally , the accuracy of the bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards , which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations . = = = Avionics and systems = = = The Victor had fully duplicated powered controls ; many of the flight controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies . Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system . This setup was developed to provide , amongst other capabilities , a level of artificial feel to the pilot . Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft , which comprised the alighting gear , flaps , nose flaps , air brakes , bomb doors , wheel brakes , nose-wheel steering , and the ram-air turbine scoops . An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2 , electrical reliability being noticeably improved . To evade enemy detection and interception efforts , the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) suite which were operated by the air electronics officer ( AEO ) , who had primary responsibility for the aircraft 's electronics and communication systems . The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar in the vicinity of the aircraft , and to provide situational awareness for the crew . Enemy communications could also be jammed , and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective . The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment . Some of the ECM equipment which initially saw use on the Victor , such as the original chaff dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar , had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete by the time the Victor had entered service . Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites , as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor 's role ; for example , the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar . The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems , including a passive radar warning receiver , a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment . Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff / flares were also new additions . While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar , neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet . = = = Engines = = = The Victor B.1 was powered by an arrangement of four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines . The engines were embedded in pairs into the aircraft 's wing root ; because of the high mounted position of the wing , the tail had to adopt a high mounting to maintain clearance of the jet turbulence , however the airbrakes were ideally situated to take advantage of this phenomenon . Difficulties were encountered with the Sapphires when stationed in tropical environments ; several engines were destroyed by the turbine blades striking the outer engine casing . The Victor B.2 adopted the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan ; the Conway at one point held the distinction of being the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside of the Soviet Union , and were significantly more powerful than the preceding Sapphire engines employed upon on the B.1. The Victor B.2 featured a distinct change in the aircraft 's engine arrangements ; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit ( AAPU ) , effectively a small fifth engine . The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines , and also providing electrical power on the ground or alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures . The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment . Turbine-driven alternators , otherwise known as ram air turbines ( RATs ) , had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost . Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs , which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls . In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit . = = = Flight profile = = = The Victor was commonly described as having good handling and excellent performance , along with favourable low speed flight characteristics . During the flight tests of the first prototype , the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance , flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems ; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft . Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers . At low altitude , the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner , in part due to its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing . One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability ; once lined up with the runway , the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink , giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot . The Victor has been described as an agile aircraft , atypical for a large bomber aircraft ; in 1958 , a Victor had performed several loops and a barrel roll during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow . Manoeuverability was greatly enabled by the light controls , quick response of the aircraft , and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable tail-mounted airbrake . The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds , although multiple instances have occurred in which the sound barrier was broken . During development of the Victor B.2 , the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuverability , which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft 's height and range performance . = = Operational history = = The Victor was the last of the V bombers to enter service , with deliveries of B.1s to No. 232 Operational Conversion Unit RAF based at RAF Gaydon , Warwickshire before the end of 1957 . The first operational bomber squadron , 10 Squadron , formed at RAF Cottesmore in April 1958 , with a second squadron , 15 Squadron forming before the end of the year . Four Victors , fitted with Yellow Astor reconnaissance radar , together with a number of passive sensors , were used to equip a secretive unit , the Radar Reconnaissance Flight at RAF Wyton . The Victor bomber force continued to build up , with 57 Squadron forming in March 1959 and 55 Squadron in October 1960 . At its height , the Victor was simultaneously operating with six squadrons of RAF Bomber Command . According to the operational doctrine developed by the RAF , in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike , each Victor would have operated entirely independently ; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon the effectiveness of their individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target ; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime . Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important ; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years , and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel . In order to maximize the operational lifespan of each aircraft , Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week . Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection , refuelling and turnaround operations . In times of high international tension , the V-bombers would be dispersed and have been maintained at a high state of readiness ; if the order was given to deploy a nuclear strike , Victors at high readiness would have been airborne in under four minutes from the point the order had been issued . British intelligence had estimated that the Soviet 's radar network was capable of detecting the Victor at up to 200 miles away , so to avoid interception , the Victor would follow carefully planned routes to exploit weaknesses in the Soviet detection network . This tactic was employed in conjunction with the Victor 's extensive onboard electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) to increase the chances of evasion . Whilst originally the Victor would have maintained high altitude flight throughout a nuclear strike mission , rapid advances of the Soviet anti-aircraft warfare capabilities ( exemplified by the downing of a U2 from 70,000 ft in 1960 ) led to this tactic being abandoned : a low-level high-speed approach supported by increasingly sophisticated ECMs was adopted in its place . The improved Victor B.2 started to be delivered in 1961 , with the first B.2 Squadron , 139 Squadron forming in February 1962 , and a second , 100 Squadron in May 1962 . These were the only two bomber squadrons to form on the B.2 , as the last 28 Victors on order were cancelled . The prospect of Skybolt ballistic missiles , with which each V-bomber could strike at two separate targets , meant that fewer bombers would be needed , while the government were unhappy with Sir Frederick Handley Page 's resistance to their pressure to merge his company with competitors . While Skybolt 's development would be terminated , Victor B.2s were retrofitted as carrier aircraft for the Blue Steel standoff nuclear missile . The introduction of standoff weapons and the switch to low-level flight in order to evade radar detection was said to be decisive factors in the successful penetration of enemy territory . In 1964 \u2013 1965 , a series of detachments of Victor B.1As was deployed to RAF Tengah , Singapore as a deterrent against Indonesia during the Borneo conflict , the detachments fulfilling a strategic deterrent role as part of Far East Air Force , while also giving valuable training in low-level flight and visual bombing . In September 1964 , with the confrontation with Indonesia reaching a peak , the detachment of four Victors was prepared for rapid dispersal , with two aircraft loaded with live conventional bombs and held on one-hour readiness , ready to fly operational sorties . However , they were never required to fly combat missions and the high readiness alert finished at the end of the month . Following the discovery of fatigue cracks , developing due to their low-altitude usage , the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage by the end of 1968 . The RAF had experienced intense demand upon its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet , and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s , thus it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also . Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks , the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings , and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers . The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation . The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley , who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page , with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life . While the Victor was never permanently based with any units stationed overseas , temporary deployments were frequently conducted , often in a ceremonial capacity or to participate in training exercises and competitions . Victor squadrons were dispatched on several extended deployments to the Far East , and short term deployments to Canada were also conducted for training purposes . At one point during the early 1960s , South Africa showed considerable interest in the acquisition of several bomber-configured Victors ; in the end , the Victor would not serve with any other operator other than the RAF . Several of the Victor B.2s had been converted for Strategic Reconnaissance mission following the retirement of the Valiant in this capacity . In service , this type was primarily used in surveillance of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas , capable of surveying 400,000 square miles in an eight-hour mission ; they were also used to sample the fallout from French nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific . Originally reconnaissance Victors were equipped for visual reconnaissance ; however , it was found to be cheaper to assign Canberra light bombers to this duty and as such the cameras were removed in 1970 . Subsequently , radar-based reconnaissance was emphasised in the type 's role . The reconnaissance Victors remained in use until 1974 when they followed the standard bombers into the tanker conversion line ; a handful of modified Avro Vulcans assumed the maritime radar reconnaissance role in their place . Two of the V-bombers , the Victor and the Vulcan , played a high-profile role during the 1982 Falklands War . In order to cross the vast distance of the Atlantic Ocean , a single Vulcan required refuelling several times from Victor tankers . A total of three bombing missions were flown against Argentine forces deployed to the Falklands , with approximately 1.1 million gal ( 5 million L ) of fuel consumed in each mission . At the time , these missions held the record for the world 's longest-distance bombing raids . The deployment of other assets to the theatre , such as the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod and Lockheed Hercules , required the support of the Victor tanker fleet , which had been temporarily relocated to RAF Ascension Island for the campaign . The Victor also undertook several reconnaissance missions over the South Atlantic . These missions provided valuable intelligence for the retaking of South Georgia by British forces . Following the invasion of Kuwait by neighbouring Iraq in 1991 , a total of eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War . RAF strike aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado would frequently make use of the tanker to refuel prior to launching cross-border strikes inside of Iraq . Shortly after the Gulf War , the remaining Victor fleet was quickly retired in 1993 , at which point it had been the last of the three V-bombers in operational service ; retiring nine years after the last Vulcan , although the Vulcan had survived longer in its original role as a bomber . = = Variants = = HP.80 Prototype , two aircraft built .

The road travels northward , much of it along the shore of Lake Michigan before reaching its terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park . The roadway has been in the state highway system since the late 1920s . It has been realigned a few times , most recently in the late 1990s . = = Route description = = M-116 begins in Ludington at the intersection of James Street and Ludington Avenue . It is at this intersection where US 10 turns southward and heads to the Ludington \u2013 Manitowoc ferry docks . From here , M-116 continues westward along Ludington Avenue through a mixed commercial area for about one-half mile ( 0.8 km ) before turning north on Lakeshore Drive . The road continues as North Lakeshore Drive through resident areas and passes the Lakeview Cemetery . Before passing the Lincoln Hills Golf Club , M-116 crosses a narrow section of Lincoln Lake and then curves westward towards the shore of Lake Michigan as it approaches the state park . The route runs along the coast of Lake Michigan for the remainder of its route , through an area of sand dunes , until reaching its northern terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park . Ludington State Park is bound to the west by Lake Michigan , the north by sand dunes and to the east by Hamlin Lake . As such , M-116 provides the only road access to the park from the south . The park encompasses 5,300 acres ( 2,100 ha ) offering biking , hiking , fishing , tubing , boating and ice skating in the winter . The park is also home to the 112-foot ( 34 m ) tall Big Sable Point Lighthouse , built in 1867 , which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The highway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , which is responsible for maintaining and constructing transportation infrastructure in the state , including highways . As part of this role , the department periodically conducts surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2009 , MDOT calculated that 7,377 vehicles used the southern section of M-116 daily near the US 10 junction . On the north end , only 859 vehicles used the roadway near the state park entrance each day . The highway has not been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . In December 2014 , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder authorized a portion of the highway in Ludington State Park between Little River and Big Sable in Mason County to be named \" The Paul K. Butterfield II Memorial Highway \" , in honor of that Michigan State Police Trooper who was murdered during a traffic stop there in 2013 . The ceremony to do so took place in early February 2015 . = = History = = M-116 was first designated in May or June 1928 from the north city limit of Ludington north to the Sable River , but not all of it was built and open to traffic . It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US 10 . There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933 . The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge . The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US 10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the car ferry docks . At that time , M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street . = = Major intersections = = The entire highway is in Mason County .",

Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters , solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color . The pair travel through space by swinging on clouds and asteroids with the monster 's elongated tongue , searching other planets for life to which the boy can relate . It is also a part of The Basement Collection . McMillen and Glaiel created the game and developed it in 14 days . Both developers expressed interest in seeing a version being released on the Wii game console through the WiiWare online service . Aether received a positive response from video game blogs for its unusual visual style and atmosphere . The single looped piece of background music received a mixed response and the controls were highlighted as an area of the game that could have been improved before release . = = Gameplay = = Aether is a space adventure game with washed-out pastel colors and a varying soundtrack consisting of a piano , synthesizer , guitar , and percussion piece . There are four monochrome planets to explore , which have subdued hues . Players control a lonely boy from Earth and an octopus-like monster he befriends . The monster 's tongue is used to propel itself and the boy through space and onto other planets . Each planet has a unique soundtrack that gets louder as you approach it . Each moon or planet exerts gravity over the player character , requiring momentum to escape from the planet 's orbit . To escape a planet , the tongue must first be latched onto a cloud floating above the planet 's surface , which can then be used to swing the player around . By propelling themselves from the initial cloud using swinging momentum , players can latch onto the next and repeat the process to leave the planet 's orbit . After reaching space the process is repeated with stars and asteroids . In space the lack of gravity causes the player to drift until the direction is changed by swinging on another object . When travelling through space , players are drawn to a planet 's orbit once they get close . Each planet 's location is labeled with a colored marker which disappears once that planet 's puzzle is solved . The player encounters characters who can be helped if a puzzle is solved . Each planet besides Earth has its own puzzle . The monster 's ability to swing around objects is used in some of the game 's puzzles . One puzzle involves swinging on the crystals which surround the core of a hollow planet called Gravida , without swinging on the same crystal twice or breaking the chain . Solving each planet 's puzzle produces a flash of light , after which monochrome planets change to color , subdued pastel colors brighten , and the planet 's unique soundtrack becomes permanent . The game 's plot describes a journey through a child 's emotions and anxieties . After befriending the monster , the boy leaves Earth on the creature 's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy . He hopes to find someone to relate to . The hollow planet Gravida 's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains . This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures , some of which ride on its back . One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida . Though it is isolated and lonely , the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it . The planet Malaisus is composed of water , with a monster identical to the player 's swimming around with a shoal of fish . The monster tells the player to leave . Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides , one angry and one happy . A two-faced creature travels across the surface ; one is happy and the other morose . Bibulon is orbited by four moons , each of which has differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy . When players find the planet Debasa , they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog . Gravity is very intense within the fog . Four orbiting satellites produce the fog , which has trapped two boys . Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed . After restoring color to all the surrounding planets , the game is completed by returning to Earth . The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster ; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land . Both fly upwards and land on the moon , where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing . = = Development = = Aether was created by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel , McMillen was a member of independent development studio Cryptic Sea and co-creator of the award winning Gish . Glaiel runs his own independent studio , Glaiel Games , and develops Flash games for game and animation website Newgrounds . The game 's graphics and story were created by McMillen , while Glaiel wrote the game 's music and code . The game was developed in 14 days ; McMillen found he could \" ride off \" Glaiel 's inspiration and allowed the project to be completed quickly . \" People being creative and taking risks with their work always is inspiring to me , honesty in art is also very inspiring , \" he stated . McMillen 's childhood experiences and fears were used for the game 's themes of loneliness , nervousness , and fear of abandonment or rejection . The boy 's journeys through space represent inward-thinking and imagination , planets represent fears and the inhabitants personify McMillen 's childhood \" inner demons \" . He was initially unsure as to whether or not he wished to release Aether , since it was based on personal experiences and made him feel vulnerable . Glaiel created the game 's planets and gameplay , designing the layout of the planets to convey the emotions involved in the game , but he did not know which planets would ultimately be used to relate to each emotion . He felt that the game 's sense of emotion and mood was improved because development was not thoroughly planned from the outset . Both developers expressed a wish to port the game to the WiiWare service on the Wii video game console . Aether was released as part of McMillen 's game and comic compilation CD This is a Cry For Help in early November 2008 . = = Reception = = The game was positively received by gaming blogs , though reviewers held mixed opinions about the controls . The story was compared to The Little Prince , Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry 's 1943 novella . Aether 's graphics were praised by reviewers . Alec Meer of website Rock Paper Shotgun described them as \" beautiful to look at \" , Justin McElroy of Joystiq said the game has a \" unique visual style \" and described the pastel shades as attractive , and Peter Cohen of Macworld described them as a unique look composed of \" cute characters with sometimes grotesque imagery \" . \" StaceyG \" of Jay Is Games found the music relaxing and called the game \" a truly compelling experience with excellent atmosphere \" . Meer also enjoyed the game but found the looped piano music irritating . Nate Ralph of Wired found the game \" hauntingly beautiful , if short \" . Reviewers noted that the solution to some of the puzzles were unclear , further hindered by the planets ' inhabitants , whose dialogue does not change when the planet 's puzzle is completed . The tongue propulsion physics were said to be clumsy by StaceyG , who stated that , in conjunction with the gravity exerted by planets , it is more difficult to leave planets ' surfaces than to navigate through space . Both Meer and StaceyG enjoyed the spacefaring aspect of the game , and Derek Yu of website TIGSource stated the controls \" sometimes felt brilliant , at other times felt unresponsive and awkward . \" Patrick Dugan of Play This Thing saw potential in the tongue-swinging gameplay , noting that Aether appeared to be the first of a series . He suggested that more spatial elements , such as nebulae and black holes , would have made space flight more interesting . McMillen described Aether as \" just the prelude to a larger experience \" , while Yu suggested that a larger game with improved controls \" could be something better than great \" . Aether received an Honorable Mention at IndieCade in 2009 .",

To expedite the process the maximum use was made of the components of the Tu-70 . Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version . A new , narrower fuselage was designed which included a rear cargo hatch , a vehicle loading ramp and paratroop exit doors . Three gun turrets , dorsal , ventral and tail , were to be adapted from the Tu-4 , although they were not fitted on the prototype . It had a crew of six , three gunners , a radio-operator , a navigator and two pilots . The aircraft was intended for three different roles ; transport , parachute transport and aerial ambulance . In the first role it was designed to carry two ASU-76 assault guns , two STZ NATI artillery tractors , six or seven GAZ-67B jeeps or five 85 mm ( 3.3 in ) guns without their prime movers or any combination of equipment up to 12,000 kg ( 26,000 lb ) . To facilitate the loading of cargo a winch was mounted on the ceiling of the cargo hold with a capacity of 3,000 kg ( 6,600 lb ) . It could carry either 120 troops , 96 fully loaded paratroopers or 64 standard parachute loads . As an aerial ambulance it could carry 31 stretchers and four medical attendants . = = Operational history = = Construction of the first prototype was quite prolonged ; the aircraft was not finished until November 1949 , with its first flight taking place on 21 January 1950 . It finished its manufacturer 's trials the following May , but Tupolev decided not to submit it for the State acceptance trials as the Soviet Air Force had already decided that it would be cheaper to rely on its existing transports and to modify Tu-4 bombers for the cargo role . The prototype was used by the MAP ( Russian : Ministerstvo Aviatsionnoy Promyshlennosti \u2013 Ministry of Aviation Industry ) until it crashed in October 1954 . = = Specifications = = Data from Gunston General characteristics Crew : 6 Length : 35.61 m ( 116 ft 10 in ) Wingspan : 43.83 m ( 145 ft 2 \u215b in ) Height : 9.05 m ( 29 ft 8 \u00bc in ) Wing area : 167.2 m \u00b2 ( 1800 ft \u00b2 ) Empty weight : 37,810 kg ( 83,355 lb ) Loaded weight : 56,660 kg ( 124,912 lb ) Useful load : 12,000 kg ( 26,455 lb ) Max. takeoff weight : 65,400 kg ( 144,180 lb ) Powerplant : 4 \u00d7 Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN 18-cylinder two-row radial engine , 1976 kW ( 2650 hp ) each Performance Maximum speed : 545 km / h ( 339 mph ) Cruise speed : km / h ( knots , mph ) Stall speed : km / h ( knots , mph ) Range : 4140 km ( 2573 mi ) Service ceiling : 9500 m ( 31,170 ft ) Rate of climb : m / s ( ft / min ) Wing loading : kg / m \u00b2 ( lb / ft \u00b2 ) Power / mass : W / kg ( hp / lb ) Armament 7 x 20 mm Berezin B-20 cannon ( planned )",

                    "text": "Lockheed XF-104 = The Lockheed XF-104 was a single-engine , high-performance , supersonic interceptor prototype for a United States Air Force ( USAF ) series of lightweight and simple fighters . Only two aircraft were built , one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic research and the other served as an armament testbed . Both prototypes were destroyed in accidents during testing . The XF-104 was the forerunner of over 2,500 Lockheed F-104 Starfighters . During the Korean War , USAF fighter pilots were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots . Lockheed engineers , led by Kelly Johnson , designed and submitted a novel design to the Air Force . The design was notable for its sleekness , particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage , as well as a novel pilot ejection system . The XF-104 's maiden flight came in February 1954 . The flight test program encountered problems , some of which were resolved ; however , the XF-104 performance proved better than estimates . Both prototypes were lost through accidents . Nevertheless , the USAF ordered 17 service-test F-104s . Internationally , the production F-104 Starfighters proved popular , serving as front-line fighters with a number of countries . = = Development = = Clarence L. \" Kelly \" Johnson , chief engineer at Lockheed 's Skunk Works , visited Korea in December 1951 and talked to fighter pilots about what sort of aircraft they wanted . At the time , U.S. Air Force pilots were confronting the MiG-15 \" Fagot \" in their North American F-86 Sabres , and many of the pilots felt that the MiGs were superior to the larger and more complex American design . The pilots requested a small and simple aircraft with excellent performance . One pilot in particular , Colonel Gabby Gabreski was quoted as saying ; \" I 'd rather sight with a piece of chewing gum stuck on the windscreen \" and told Johnson that radar \" was a waste of time \" . On his return to the U.S. , Johnson immediately started the design of just such an aircraft realising that an official requirement would soon be published . In March 1952 , his team was assembled , and they sketched several different aircraft proposals , ranging from small designs at 8,000 lb ( 3.6 t ) , to fairly large ones at 50,000 lb ( 23 t ) . The L-246 as the design became known remained essentially identical to the \" Model L-083 Starfighter \" as eventually delivered . The design was presented to the Air Force in November 1952 , who were interested enough to create a new proposal , inviting several companies to participate . Three additional designs were received : the Republic AP-55 , an improved version of its prototype XF-91 Thunderceptor ; the North American NA-212 , which would eventually evolve into the F-107 ; and the Northrop N-102 Fang , a new General Electric J79-powered design . Although all were interesting , Lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a development contract in March 1953 . Test data from the earlier Lockheed X-7 unmanned ramjet / rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7 's wing and tail . Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104 . Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs ; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute . The wooden mock-up was ready for inspection at the end of April , and work started on two prototypes late in May . The J79 engine was not yet ready , so both prototypes were instead designed to use the Wright J65 , a licensed built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire . Construction of the first prototype XF-104 ( US serial number 53-7786 , Buzz number FG-786 ) began in summer 1953 at Lockheed 's Burbank , California factory . This aircraft was powered by a non-afterburning Buick-built Wright J65-B-3 turbojet . The first prototype was completed by early 1954 , and started flying in March . The total time from award of the contract to first flight was only one year , a very short time even then , and unheard of today , when 10 \u2013 15 years is more typical . Construction of the second prototype ( s / n 53-7787 ) proceeded at a slower pace . = = Design = = In order to achieve the desired performance , Lockheed chose a minimalist approach : a design that would achieve high performance by wrapping the lightest , most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine . The emphasis was on minimizing drag and mass . The XF-104 had a radical wing design . Most supersonic jets use a swept or delta wing . This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance , lift , and internal space for fuel and equipment . However the most efficient shape for high-speed , supersonic flight had been found to be a small , straight , mid-mounted , trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading . The wing was extremely thin , with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4 % . The leading edges of the wing were so thin ( 0.016 in / 0.41 mm ) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews , and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations . The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage . The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch ( 25 mm ) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument . The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed . The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft . After extensive wind tunnel testing , the stabilator was mounted at the top of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis . Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective , it could act as a wing on rudder application ( a phenomenon known as \" Dutch roll \" ) . To offset this effect , the wings were angled downward to give 10 \u00b0 anhedral . The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at the bottom of the fin . The fuselage of the XF-104 had a high fineness ratio , i.e. , tapering sharply towards the nose , and a small frontal area of 25 sq ft ( 2.3 m2 ) . The fuselage was tightly packed , containing the cockpit , avionics , cannon , all internal fuel , landing gear , and engine . The air intakes , designed by Ben Rich , were of fixed geometry without inlet cones , since the J65-powered aircraft was incapable of Mach 2 performance . They were similar to those of the F-94 Starfire , being mounted slightly away from the fuselage , with an inner splitter plate for the boundary layer bleed air . The combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack , at which point induced drag became very high . The XF-104 featured an unusual downward-ejecting Stanley B seat . It was feared that contemporary ejection seat designs would not have enough explosive power to clear the high \" T \" tail assembly . In the event of the seat not firing , it was possible to manually release the lower fuselage hatch and then exit the aircraft via gravity . The F-104 series aircraft would later convert to upward-ejecting seats but the fuselage hatch was retained as a useful maintenance feature . = = Operational history = = = = = Testing and evaluation = = = The first XF-104 ( Lockheed 083-1001 , s / n 53-7786 ) was transported to Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy during the night of 24 \u2013 25 February , where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing . On 28 February 1954 , the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a high-speed taxi , but its first official flight took place on 4 March . During that flight , the landing gear did not retract , and LeVier landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes . Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system . Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March , when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally . The second prototype ( Lockheed 083-1002 , s / n 53-7787 ) , fitted with the afterburning J65 from the start , first flew on 5 October . Since it was to be the armament test bed , it was fitted with the 20 mm ( .79 in ) M61 Vulcan cannon and was equipped with an AN / ASG-14T-1 fire control system . XF-104 # 2 achieved a top speed of Mach 1.79 at 60,000 feet ( 18,000 m ) on 25 March 1955 , piloted by Lockheed test pilot J. Ray Goudey . This was the highest speed achieved by the XF-104 . XF-104 # 1 was subsonic in level flight when powered by the non-afterburning J65 , but Mach 1 could be easily exceeded during a slight descent . In July 1954 , the J65-B-3 was replaced by the afterburning J65-W-7 turbojet . With this engine installed , the performance of the XF-104 was greatly improved . Maximum level speed was Mach 1.49 at 41,000 ft ( 12,000 m ) , and an altitude of 55,000 ft ( 17,000 m ) could be attained in a zoom climb , while Mach 1.6 could be attained in a dive . The first XF-104 was accepted by the USAF in November 1955 . Initial aerial firing tests with the Vulcan cannon on the second aircraft were successful , but on 17 December , there was an explosion during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls . Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake . An investigation later showed that one of the 20 mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech , blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell . Jet fuel had run into the gun bay , and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake . The engine immediately flooded with fuel , causing the compressor stalls . = = = Crashes = = = XF-104 53-7786 was lost in a crash on 11 July 1957 when it developed an uncontrollable tail flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests . The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe , and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject . Vertical fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds of no more than Mach 0.95 at the time of the accident . Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum , arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties . XF-104 53-7787 was lost on 14 April 1955 after accumulating over 1,000 flying hours when test pilot Herman Salmon was forced to eject during gun firing trials at 50,000 ft ( 15,000 m ) . The gun malfunctioned during a test firing , and severe vibrations began to build up which knocked loose the ejection hatch below the cockpit . Cabin pressure was lost with Salmon 's pressure suit inflating and covering his face so that he could not see . Recalling LeVier 's harrowing experience with the exploding cannon shell the previous December , Salmon believed that the same thing had happened to him and that he had no option but to eject . He later found out that he could have saved 53-7787 by simply bringing it down to a lower altitude and waiting for his pressure suit to deflate . With the loss of the armament testbed , Lockheed engineers were forced to find an alternative , and armament trials were continued on a modified F-94C Starfire . The two XF-104s amassed an approximate total of 250 flight hours . = = = Testing conclusions = = = Flight testing proved that performance estimates were accurate and that even when fitted with the low powered J65 engine , the XF-104 flew faster than the other Century Series fighters being developed at the time . The XF-104 's ceiling at 60,000 ft ( 18,000 m ) was 7,000 ft ( 2,100 m ) higher than predicted , and it exceeded estimated speed and drag figures by two to three percent . It was noted however that the low thrust of the J65 engine did not enable the full performance potential of the type to be realized . A number of minor problems surfaced , but were readily fixed . The yaw damper of the XF-104 was found to be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center , these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system . The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds ( remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104 ) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes . During a later interview , Kelly Johnson was asked about his opinion on the aircraft , \" Did it come up to my designs ? In terms of performance , yes . In terms of engine , we went through a great many engine problems , not with the J65s but with the J79s . \" For his part in designing the F-104 airframe , Johnson was jointly awarded the Collier Trophy in 1958 , sharing the honor with General Electric ( engine ) and the U.S. Air Force ( Flight Records ) . = = = F-104 production = = = Official approval of the XF-104 design led to a contract for 17 YF-104A service test aircraft and a production run of over 2,500 aircraft built both in the United States and under license worldwide . Visible changes from the XF-104 to production versions of the Starfighter include a longer fuselage ( to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel ) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear ( except two-seat versions ) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat . A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program . Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features . Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem . Since the internal fuel capacity was low limiting the useful range of the aircraft , extra capacity was provided on later versions by lengthening the forward fuselage . = = Specifications ( XF-104 ) = = Data from Bowman , Drendel General characteristics Crew : 1 Length : 49 ft 2 in ( 15 m ) Wingspan : 21 ft 11 in ( 6.69 m ) Height : 13 ft 6 in ( 4.1 m ) Wing area : 196 ft \u00b2 ( 18.21 m \u00b2 ) Airfoil : Bi-convex 3.36 % Empty weight : 11,500 lb ( 5,216 kg ) Loaded weight : 16,700 lb ( 7,575 kg ) Max. takeoff weight : 15,700 lb ( 7,120 kg ) Powerplant : 1 \u00d7 Wright J65 turbojet Dry thrust : 7,800 lbf ( 34.70 kN ) Thrust with afterburner : 10,300 lbf ( 45.82 kN ) Performance Maximum speed : 1,151 kn ( 1,324 mph , 2,131 km / h ) Stall speed : 139 kn ( 160 mph , 257 km / h ) Range : 695 nmi ( 800 mi , 1,290 km ) Service ceiling : 50,500 ft ( 15,500 m ) Armament Guns : 1 \u00d7 T171 Vulcan 20 mm ( .79 in ) cannon ( XF-104 083-1002 only )",

While rapping is solely performed by Shakur , Erick Sermon and producer Easy Mo Bee are also featured in the song , primarily as background vocalists . The song uses the bassline from the \" Computer Love \" , and the theme focuses on relationship and infidelity issues . Debuting at number sixty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100 , the song did fairly well in the United States . It was also well received by critics , with many writers commenting on its romantic tone . The song 's music video does not have any shots of Shakur , since he was incarcerated at the time . Instead , the video features many celebrities such as Coolio , Ice-T , Warren G , Adina Howard and Kenya Moore .

The main plot of the video follows Coolio while he is working in the hotel . = = Writing and composition = = The idea for \" Temptations \" began in late 1993 when record producer Easy Mo Bee came to Shakur while he was on the set of Above the Rim ( 1994 ) . At Rucker Park in New York City , Mo Bee approached Shakur with several different songs they could sample from in the Me Against the World album . Out of the pieces he showed the rapper , Shakur favored the Zapp song \" Computer Love . \" Despite being frequently sampled in the past by other artists , Shakur proposed that they simply speed up the tempo of \" Computer Love \" and use a low frequency automatic filter to retrieve the song 's bassline . After adding new beats and synth pads / leads , Mo Bee decided to add a sample of the Redman and Erick Sermon song \" Watch Yo Nuggets \" , which contributes to much of the song 's tenor section with the repeated line of \" Hey . \" The song 's hook samples \" Sing a Simple Song \" by Sly & the Family Stone . The song also features Mo Bee and some of his friends singing harmonies . \" Temptations \" deals with a male-female relationship , where Shakur is \u2014 in Mo Bee 's word 's \u2014 basically saying to his significant other , \" I like the time I 'm spendin ' with [ you ] , but baby , I 'm busy . \" Other than the theme of the relationship issues , the song also focuses on the ability for anyone to feel lonely .

Nelson said the video 's production was ambitious , stating : \" It 's an incredible challenge to make a creative clip of a song without the artist . \" He goes onto say that Coolio helped enormously because he was the first to commit to his role as the bellboy . Nelson says that Coolio 's role \" provides the thread that weaves together the entire concept of the video . \" Yvette Lang , who executive produced the clip for F.M. Rocks , described the filming to be like a \" big party \" to show their support for Shakur . Ice-T 's role as the hotel concierge was not originally intended . At first , there was a comedian set to play his role , but he ended up cancelling at the last minute . Since Ice-T was only available to shoot in the morning , Nelson decided to make him the concierge . The director called it a \" strange blessing \" since he is more memorable as a concierge , rather than his intended role . \" I shot the clip as if it were a movie , and the preview edit is the equivalent of a film trailer .

It served as a chapel of ease to another church in the area , St Ceidio 's . Some restoration work was carried out in the 19th century , but St Mary 's has since fallen into disuse and is now largely in ruins . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is \" a late Medieval church of exceptionally simple character \" , and is virtually unaltered despite its poor condition . One writer has said that St Mary 's \" has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in Anglesey \" . = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is in the countryside in Rhodogeidio , in Anglesey , north Wales . It is about 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) north of Llannerch-y-medd , towards the north of Anglesey . It is reached by a footpath from a farm \u2013 it is only accessible on foot \u2013 and is surrounded by a churchyard . It was built in the 15th century as a chapel of ease to serve St Ceidio 's Church , Rhodogeidio , about 0.75 miles ( 1.25 km ) to the east . Restoration work was carried out in the 19th century , but the church later fell into disuse . It has been in ruins since sometime between 1937 , when the survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded its condition as \" fair \" , and 1970 , when it was given listed building status and its \" very poor \" condition noted . = = Architecture and fittings = = St Mary 's is a small church , measuring 30 feet by 12 feet 3 inches ( about 9.1 by 3.7 m ) . It dates from the late medieval period , and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones . It had a slate roof , although most of the roof has now gone , and there is a bellcote at the west end , which may be original rather than a later addition . There is no physical division between the nave and the chancel , although one account in the 19th century said that there had originally been a screen separating them , and some traces of it still remained at that time . Entrance to the church was through a doorway with a square head , in the north wall at the west end ; this dates from the 19th century . An inscribed stone near the doorway has the date 1798 and some initials , and it has been suggested that this marked the date of some renovation work . There are two windows on the south wall , one fully blocked and one partially blocked . The small window at the east end of the church dates from the latter part of the 15th century . Inside , little remains , but the ruins still have most of the original roof trusses ( one , at the west end of the church , is a replacement ) . There are some slate memorial tablets on the walls , dating from the middle of the 19th century , and a plain 12th-century circular font . The 1937 survey noted a bell dating from 1717 and some portions of 17th-century panelled seating near the pulpit ; these were not recorded when the church was given listed status in 1970 . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 and has been listed because it is \" a late Medieval church of exceptionally simple character \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes that despite its \" very poor condition \" , St Mary 's \" is a virtually unaltered late Medieval building ( even retaining the original roof trusses ) and in its isolation , is characteristic of many churches on the island . \" Writing in 1859 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones called it a \" small , plain , single-aisled chapel \" , and said that one of the small south windows was \" a good specimen of its kind . \" A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that the \" roofless ruin \" of St Mary 's \" has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in Anglesey \" .",
                "Princeton University Chapel = The Princeton University Chapel is located on that university 's main campus in Princeton , New Jersey , United States . It replaces an older chapel that burned down in 1920 . Designed in 1921 by Ralph Adams Cram in his signature Collegiate Gothic style , it was built by the university between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $ 2.3 million . Martin Luther King , Jr . , delivered a sermon there in 1960 . The chapel was rededicated in an interfaith ceremony in 2002 following a major two-year restoration . Its size and design evoke a small cathedral of the English Middle Ages . The only university chapel of its size at the time it was built was King 's College Chapel at the University of Cambridge . The foundation is poured concrete , and the superstructure is sandstone and limestone . The main sanctuary consists of a narthex , a gallery , a nave , two transepts joined by a crossing , and an elevated choir . The chapel 's extensive iconography consists of stained glass , stonemasonry , and wood carvings . Among the stained glass are four \" great windows \" , one facing each cardinal direction , and four \" Christian epic \" windows in the walls of the choir . The iconography was planned by Albert M. Friend , a faculty member in Princeton 's Department of Art and Archaeology , with the goal of portraying , in one scholar 's words , a \" synthesis between Christian faith and modern thought . \" The chapel seats almost 2,000 people . A nondenominational chapel , it hosts weekly ecumenical Christian services and daily Catholic Masses . It also hosts several annual special events , such as baccalaureate services and commencements . = = History = = Princeton University built the chapel to replace the Marquand Chapel , which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it burned to the ground in 1920 . The location for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons : symbolically , the new chapel would rise from the ashes of the old one , and practically , it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward . Ralph Adams Cram , the university 's supervising architect , designed and oversaw construction of the new chapel . Cram sought to build a crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed on the Princeton campus . The university 's president , John Grier Hibben , also had a stake in the project : student hostility toward Princeton 's brand of mainline Presbyterianism was on the rise . An ordained minister , Hibben hoped the new chapel 's majesty would inspire students to attend services of their own volition . Cram , a convert to High Church Episcopalianism from Unitarianism , also lent support to this aim . Cram designed the chapel with the assistance of Alexander Hoyle , a member of his firm . Albert M. Friend , a faculty member in Princeton 's Department of Art and Archaeology , played a central role in planning the iconography . It was built by Matthews Construction Company , which worked on several projects on Princeton 's campus . Among those who contributed to the design of stained glass windows were Charles Connick , Henry Lee Willet ( of the studio that would become Willet Hauser ) , and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d 'Ascenzo . The plans for the new chapel were made public in 1921 . Hibben called replacing the Marquand Chapel \" an immediate necessity \" ; nonetheless , the project encountered financial problems early on . The insurance money from the Marquand Chapel was insufficient , and fundraising for the chapel competed with an ongoing general capital campaign for the university . Ground was ultimately broken during Princeton 's commencement ceremonies in June 1924 , and in the following year Cram and Hibben laid the cornerstone . The construction received considerable media attention , as it promised to be the largest university chapel in the United States and the second largest in the world after King 's College Chapel , Cambridge . The construction cost about $ 2.3 million and was completed in 1928 . Hibben led the dedication ceremony on May 31 of that year , in an elaborate ceremony covered by TIME . On March 13 , 1960 , less than six weeks after the first of the Greensboro sit-ins , Martin Luther King , Jr . , delivered a sermon at the chapel . In the sermon he called for universal brotherhood and a life of spiritual richness . A plaque on the interior south wall of the chapel 's nave commemorates the occasion . The chapel underwent a two-year , $ 10 million restoration between 2000 and 2002 . Despite the complexity of the work , the chapel remained open throughout the restoration . The project earned a New Jersey Historic Preservation Award in 2002 , and the stone work won the 2004 Tucker Award for Renovation and Restoration from Stone World magazine . At the time , two experts working on the stained glass restoration called it the largest such project that had ever been undertaken in the United States ; too large for a single studio , it was divided among studios in Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , and New York . Following the restoration , the chapel was rededicated in an interfaith ceremony in which people belonging to Buddhism , Christianity , Islam , and Judaism gave prayers . Leading the ceremony , then-Dean of Religious Life Thomas Breidenthal said , \" This edifice is unmistakably Christian , [ but ] this chapel is meant to belong to all of us . \" = = Description = = The chapel 's Collegiate Gothic design evokes an English church of the Middle Ages , although several aspects of it , including the vault and its supports , recall French churches . The chapel is cruciform and is built on the scale of a large parish church or a small cathedral . The only precedent for a university chapel of this size was King 's College Chapel , and only a small part of that chapel was used regularly . Stillwell cites Exeter Cathedral and the Octagon tower of Ely Cathedral as precedents for the architectural detail , but notes that the Princeton chapel 's detail nonetheless differs significantly from these . The foundation is made of poured concrete . When the chapel was built , the rest of the structure above the grade level was masonry , and the only metal reinforcement was some structural steel in the framing of the roof . During the 2000-02 restoration , some pinnacles were reset with stainless steel anchors . The arches of the crossing were designed to support the addition of a central tower , but this option has not been exercised : in Bush and Kemeny 's words , \" Cram felt that Princeton already had enough towers . \" = = = Exterior = = = The chapel is approximately the size of a small medieval English cathedral . Measured on the exterior , it is 277 feet ( 84 m ) long , 76 feet ( 23 m ) wide at its transepts , and 121 feet ( 37 m ) high . The exterior is constructed largely from Pennsylvania sandstone , with Indiana limestone used for the trim . On the western end of the chapel is the narthex , which has entrances on the north , west , and south walls . An additional door on the chapel 's north side opens onto the Hibben Garden , named in recognition of John Grier Hibben 's role in the chapel 's construction and dedication . The garden of evergeens was designed by H. Russell Butler , Jr . On the chapel 's south side are an additional door at ground level to the east and an exterior pulpit , designed after one at Magdalen College , Oxford , and named Bright Pulpit , in honor of John Bright . The chapel is connected on its eastern side to Dickinson Hall by the Rothschild arch , symbolizing a connection between religion and scholarship . Cram resigned as Princeton 's supervising architect over the inclusion of the arch , which he disliked ; nonetheless , he participated in the chapel 's 1928 dedication ceremony . Nearby is the Mather Sundial , a replica of the Turnbull Sundial in the courtyard of Corpus Christi College , Oxford . A statue of a pelican , a religious symbol associated with Corpus Christi , sits atop the sundial , which was presented to Princeton in 1907 by William Mather , then the governor of Victoria University of Manchester . Each of the three narthex entrances sits below a tympanum . These 3 tympana were designed and sculpted by John Angel . The tympanum above the main , west entrance depicts Jesus as described in the Book of Revelation , together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography . It resembles the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral . Beneath the figure of Christ is Princeton University 's shield , illustrating the university 's motto , Dei sub numine viget ( \" Under the power of God she flourishes \" ) . The tympana above the north and south entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ , respectively . The exterior iconography includes two notable whimsical elements . A downspout on the east wall features a relief of a bulldog head ; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University , whose mascot is the bulldog . ( Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college , so it is unclear what interest he might have had promoting Yale . ) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram 's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance ; Cram is identifiable by his glasses . = = = Interior = = = Measured in the interior , the chapel is 249 feet ( 76 m ) long , 93.5 feet ( 28 m ) wide at its transepts , and 78.5 feet ( 24 m ) high at the crossing . Most of the interior is limestone , but the aisles and the central area of the choir are Aquia Creek sandstone . Sound-absorbing tile is mounted on parts of the wall and vault . Running west to east , the main sanctuary consists of a narthex , a gallery , a nave , two transepts joined by a crossing , and an elevated choir ; it seats almost 2,000 . The building 's southeast corner houses a vestry . Inscribed on the narthex wall facing the nave is \" A Prayer for Princeton \" , which as of 2008 was still used in services at the chapel . Another inscription , from Psalm 100 , refers to Westminster Choir College , which holds its commencement ceremonies in the chapel . Two staircases on the east and west of the narthex lead to an upper gallery , which looks out upon the nave . Three doorways lead from the narthex into the nave , which is 74 feet ( 23 m ) high and named for Hibben . It is divided into three vertical levels : an arcade at ground level , a triforium beneath the roofs of the aisles , and a clerestory . The configuration and its proportions are typical of English churches , but the nave 's vaulted ceiling and the colonnettes supporting it recall French churches . The gallery above the narthex is at the level of the triforium . The aisles are narrower than in medieval churches and are used for passage rather than seating . The south aisle features five window bays , while the north has four ; where the easternmost bay would be is the entrance to a side chapel called the Blessed Sacrament Chapel . The pews in the nave are constructed from wood originally intended for Civil War gun carriages ; over 100 carvers spent more than a year producing the intricate carvings . The northern transept is named for Henry Gurdon Marquand , the benefactor of the Marquand Chapel , which burned to the ground in 1920 and which the present chapel was built to replace . An American flag flown by the USS Princeton hangs from the transept 's north wall . The southern transept is named for Chester Alwyn Braman , the first donor to the University Chapel Fund . A staircase leads from the Braman Transept to the Bright Pulpit . The choir , named Milbank Choir for Elizabeth Milbank Anderson is elevated by several steps . An altar stands at the far east end . The altar and the choir stalls were built and carved by Irving and Casson , A. H. Davenport Company , in Sherwood Forest oak ; Cram speculated that the wood may have dated from the time of Robin Hood . According to Stillwell , the woodwork \" represents an outstanding example of American craftsmanship . \" An oak made pulpit stands in front of the choir facing the nave . It originated in the north of France , probably in the mid-1500s . Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II . The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s . It had been used in a church near Avranches , France , for 200 years . A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution . It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel . The chapel 's organ has 7,897 pipes in 135 ranks and 109 stops . It was designed by Ernest M. Skinner and installed in 1928 . Skinner invented the contra fagotto stop for the Princeton chapel organ in response to a request by Princeton 's director of music . In 1990 the organ was dismantled and shipped to England for a major restoration by Mander Organs . Thomas Trotter gave the re-opening recital on the restored organ in 1992 . = = = Iconography = = = The chapel 's iconography consists of over 10,000 square feet ( 930 m2 ) of stained glass as well as stonework and wood carvings . Albert M. Friend , a faculty member in Princeton 's Department of Art and Archaeology and an expert on medieval art , was the primary planner of the iconography , with the support and assistance of Hibben , Cram , and others . A devout Christian , Friend shared Hibben 's goal of persuading Princeton students to choose lives of Christian observance and sought with the chapel 's iconography , in Milliner 's words , \" to carefully dismantle materialist objections to Christian faith and to articulate Princeton 's synthesis between Christian faith and modern thought . \" Kessler calls the stained glass \" a summa of the heritage of Christianity up to the early twentieth century . \" The stained glass windows of the nave 's north and south aisles represent one aspect of this synthesis . The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes , while the south windows contain images associated with human knowledge . The lower of these , at the triforium level , depict the teachings of Christ , while the six upper windows at the clerestory level depict influential figures in Philosophy , Theology , Chivalry , Poetry , Law , and Science , as read from east to west . The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis , symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it . Four large stained glass windows are found in the main sanctuary . The Great East Window , \" The Love of Christ \" : Milbank Choir . Due to Charles Connick , it is richly decorated with scenes from the life of Christ , culminating with an image of the Crucifixion of Jesus in the great rose . The process of selecting the scenes for this window was contentious , pitting the preferences of the conservative Presbyterian Hibben and his colleagues against those of the Milbank family , the window 's donors and liberal Episcopalians . The final compromise paired the Works of Mercy with Gospel scenes complementing each of them . The Great West Window , \" The Second Coming of Christ \" : the gallery . Due to Nicola d 'Ascenzo of Philadelphia , this window epitomizes Friend 's iconographical argument . To students who would complain of the burdens of religion in daily life , the window answers with John 10 : 10 : \" I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly . \" The Great North Window , \" Christ the Martyr \" : Marquand Transept . A verse from Mark 13 : 13 , \" He who shall endure to the end shall be saved \" , is carved below the window , declaring the theme . The lower part of the window shows historical Christians noted for their perseverance . The Great South Window , \" Christ the Teacher \" : Braman Transept . Here again the theme is declared by a Gospel verse , this time John 8 : 32 , \" And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free . \" Noted Christian writers and teachers are depicted at the bottom with the seven liberal arts . The doorway to the Blessed Sacrament Chapel on the north wall of the nave is topped by carvings of shields representing three Christian religious centers , Jerusalem , Rome , and Canterbury , and flanked by carvings representing the seven virtues and corresponding seven vices . The other door leaving the Blessed Sacrament Chapel is topped by carvings of shields representing three medieval universities , Oxford , Paris , and Salamanca , and flanked by carvings representing the seven liberal arts ( the Trivium and the Quadrivium ) and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit . Large stained glass windows due to Connick in the walls of the choir retell four \" Christian epics \" : the Divine Comedy and Le Morte d 'Arthur on the north wall and Paradise Lost and Pilgrim 's Progress on the south wall . Milliner notes that images of historical and legendary people carved into the choir 's woodwork \" reflect the intended seating during a Chapel ceremony \" . Images of figures connected to music are carved into the front ( west ) , where the choir would sit , and images of scholars are carved into the back ( east ) , where faculty would sit . Behind the altar are carved images of eight religious figures : four Catholic saints to the north , and four leaders of Protestantism to the south . The epic windows reinforce the idea of a \" Catholic north \" and a \" Protestant south \" : Catholics wrote the north epics and Protestants the south epics . In an ecumenical touch , the north and south are symbolically united by \" The Love of Christ \" in the Great East Window . Stained glass windows telling the story of the Book of Job are set into the walls of the staircases between the narthex and the gallery . Friend was known for delivering popular lectures on Job , and Milliner speculates that Friend had these windows included to address the problem of evil . Connick designed the windows in consultation with Friend , but they were made by others after the former 's death . The chapel 's iconography pays tribute in places to the other Abrahamic religions . Abraham himself is depicted in a stained glass window on the north side of the nave , together with a Star of David , a Christian cross , and a star and crescent . Other windows show Baruch Spinoza and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi ; both images were planned before the chapel was built . In several places the chapel 's iconography includes images of figures associated with Princeton University : Jonathan Edwards , Princeton 's third president : in the Theology window in the nave 's south wall and again among the Protestant leaders carved into the woodwork in the choir behind the altar . Joseph Henry , a professor and Trustee of Princeton : in the Science window in the nave 's south wall . James Madison , a 1771 graduate of Princeton and its first graduate student : in the Law window in the nave 's south wall . Adlai Stevenson II , a 1922 graduate of Princeton : in a dedicated stained glass window near the vestry . John Witherspoon , Princeton 's sixth president : in the Great South Window , among the Christian teachers . = = Current use = = The chapel operates within university 's Office of Religious Life . It is overseen by the Dean of the Chapel . The current Dean of the Chapel is Alison Boden , who is also Dean of Religious Life at Princeton . The Office of Religious Life calls the chapel \" the home of regular religious services for many of the university 's faith groups , including the 264-year-old ecumenical Christian worshiping community [ ... ] that founded Princeton in 1746 . \" Though the university was once closely associated with the Presbyterian Church , it has never been affiliated with any religious denomination . In keeping with this tradition , the chapel hosts ecumenical Christian services each Sunday . Catholic Mass is celebrated daily , Reconciliation is offered several days a week , and there is Eucharistic Adoration twice weekly . The chapel also hosts several annual special events . Opening Exercises : The ceremony marking the beginning of the university 's academic year has been held in the chapel since 1929 . Service of Remembrance : On Alumni Day , the chapel hosts a service remembering members of the Princeton University community who died during the preceding calendar year . Westminster Choir College : The nearby conservatory holds many major performances and ceremonies each year in the chapel . These events include the annual Evening of Readings and Carols in December and the Westminster commencement ceremonies in May . Baccalaureate : Princeton University 's graduating senior class attends an interfaith baccalaureate service in the chapel on the Sunday prior to Commencement . The Princeton University Chapel Choir rehearses , provides music for the weekly service , and performs occasional concerts in the chapel . = = Relative size = = The Office of Religious Life calls the chapel the third-largest university chapel in the world . According to Milliner , Princeton 's is the second-tallest by height of the nave at the crossing ; the tallest is King 's College Chapel at the University of Cambridge . The belltower of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at the University of Notre Dame , the tower of the Duke University Chapel , the tower of the University of Chicago 's Rockefeller Chapel , and the campanile of Valparaiso University 's Chapel of the Resurrection are all taller than Princeton 's chapel , which does not have a tower or other appendages .",
                "St Peter 's Church , Sudbury = St Peter 's Church is a redundant Anglican church in the town of Sudbury , Suffolk , England . It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust . The church stands in the centre of the town in a dominating position on Market Hill . A church has been on the site since at least 1180 , but the current structure dates from the 15th century , though there have been several restorations in the intervening period . Formerly a spired church , St. Peter 's now has a bell tower which , like the rest of the building , is mainly covered in flint . The interior of the church features paintings by George Frederick Bodley and Robert Cardinal , and a pipe organ originally made by T. C. Lewis . = = History = = The earliest documentary record of the church is in 1180 , when it was a chapel of ease to St Gregory 's church . The church was built in three stages , beginning with the first two bays of the chancel and the base of the tower in about 1330 \u2013 48 . The later stages of building were in about 1360 , and in about 1425 \u2013 50 . In 1643 , during the Civil War , the iconoclast William Dowsing damaged many of the items in the church . A restoration took place in 1685 , which included some alterations to the nave roof . A clock was installed in 1701 , and during the first half of the 18th century a spire of metal and wood was added ; this was replaced by another spire in 1810 . The church was restored again in 1858 \u2013 59 by William Butterfield ; this included removal of the three galleries and the box pews , re-laying the chancel floor , and replacement of the pulpit . Stained glass made by Hardman & Co. was installed in some of the windows , and more stained glass by Hardman was installed later in the century . In 1898 the chancel was restored and redecorated by George Frederick Bodley . A wooden reredos was installed in the Lady Chapel . The stonework of the exterior was restored in 1911 , when statues were inserted into three niches in the south porch . A further restoration took place in 1968 when the upper part of the tower was replaced , the spire was taken down , and most of Bodley 's paintings were removed from the chancel . The church was declared redundant in 1972 , and in 1976 was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund , the forerunner of the Churches Conservation Trust . A charitable trust , The Friends of St. Peter 's has been established to maintain and improve the church . Since being made redundant , the church has been used occasionally for services , and for a variety of events , including concerts , organ recitals and exhibitions . = = Architecture = = = = = Exterior = = = The church is constructed mainly in flint , with some stone , brick and tiles . Its plan is not quite rectangular , as it had to be confined into a limited space . The northwest corner is cut across , and the chancel is not fully in alignment with the nave . The plan consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory , north and south aisles , a two-bay chancel with the organ chamber and vestry to the north and the Lady Chapel to the south , and an extended sanctuary to the east , and a west tower incorporated in the body of the church . Its architectural styles are Decorated and Perpendicular . The tower is in three stages with angle buttresses . Its parapet consists of stepped battlements , and at the corners are statues rather than pinnacles . The aisles also have battlemented parapets , and there are more buttresses around the church . The main entrance to the church is through the west door at the base of the tower . Formerly the main entrance was through the south porch . The three statues on the exterior of the porch represent Christ , with Saint Peter on one side and Saint Gregory on the other . = = = Interior = = = The arcades are in six bays , the piers on the north arcade differing from those on the south . The roof is ceiled and divided into panels , with gilt bosses at the intersections . It is the only medieval nave roof in Suffolk to be ceiled and panelled in its original form . Some of Bodley 's painting remains on the chancel arch . In the south aisle is the octagonal 15th-century font . This was removed from the church in the 17th century to be used as a horse trough , but was returned to the church when the horses refused to drink from it . In the chancel the reredos designed by Bodley measures 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) high by 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) wide , and depicts the Crucifixion . On the sides of the chancel are 15th-century screens . In the Lady Chapel the font is carved with a depiction of the Nativity , and the reredos is a copy of Leonardo da Vinci 's Last Supper . Over the north and south doors are paintings of Moses and Aaron . These were painted by Robert Cardinall , and formerly hung in a position flanking the reredos at the east end of the church . The lectern , pulpit and altar are Victorian , as is the stained glass . The three-manual organ was built in 1911 by T. C. Lewis . It was renovated in 1942 by Henry Willis & Sons , and rebuilt in 1987 by Bishop . A major rebuild was carried out by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1999 . There is a ring of ten bells , the oldest three being cast in about 1470 , and the most recent two in 1978 .",
                "\u00c9difice Price = The \u00c9difice Price ( English : Price Building ) is an 18-floor ( originally 16 ) skyscraper in Quebec City , Canada . Built in 1930-1931 amid controversy for Price Brothers ltd . , it is the tallest building in the Old Quebec historical district , and one of the oldest skyscrapers in Canada . The building is the property of the Quebec City municipal administration , but is leased to and used by the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec . A memorial is attached to the building . In 2001 , it became the location of an official residence for the Premier of Quebec , which occupies two of the upper floors . = = History = = In 1927 , John Herbert and Arthur Clifford Price , having inherited the prosperous Price Brothers Limited after the 1924 death of their father , Sir William Price III , decided to build a new headquarters for the company in Quebec City . They did not find anything to their liking on Saint-Pierre street , at the time Quebec 's main financial district , so decided on Saint-Anne street close to the City Hall . The design for the 16-floor building was awarded to Ross and Macdonald , a prestigious firm of architects based in Montreal . The city , eager to demonstrate a progressive ethos , gave assent to the project despite heavy criticism that the administration was proving unable to protect Qu\u00e9bec 's historic area because the building replaced two historic houses . Sources conflict as to exactly when construction started : one cites June 1929 to May 1930 , while another says the construction permit was delivered in December 1929 and construction began in June 1930 ; a third gives only years : 1928-1930 . The building 's cornerstone bears an inscription reading \" This stone was laid Oct. XXIX MCMXXIX [ October 29 , 1929 ] \" . However , all sources agree that construction was rapid , and the building was finished within a year . It was inaugurated in 1931 . Although completed successfully , the building turned out to be little more than an extravagant nail in Price Brothers ' coffin . The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy , and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune . Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and ' 60s , mostly to the interior of the building . In 1983 , it was acquired by the city of Quebec , which largely used it for its civil engineering division , echoing a similar situation in New York City where the Manhattan Municipal Building is an extension of New York City Hall . Soon afterwards a long term lease placed the Price Building under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re Trans-Qu\u00e9bec ( SITQ , now Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge ) , the real estate arm of the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ( CDP ) . Further extensive renovation began that lasted until 2005 , and included the addition of two extra floors on the inside , a terrace on the 16th floor and the installation of elevators . In 2001 , the 16th and 17th floor became the Premier of Quebec 's official residence . Between 1997 and 2002 , a high-end psychiatric clinic occupied floor 2 and 3 of the building . The administration has strongly affirmed the timing of this move with the Premier 's installation to be a complete coincidence . On July 12 , 2009 , tightrope walker Ramon Kelvink Jr. walked 230 metres ( 755 ft ) from the 13th floor of the building to the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac 's 15th floor as part of the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of Quebec City . The construction of the \u00c9difice Price was heavily criticized in the 1920s , both because it showed disrespect for Price Sr. ' s intention of relocating the Price Brothers company 's operations to its original business centre of K\u00e9nogami ( now Jonqui\u00e8re ) , and because the monumental construction was perceived as out of proportion in a mixed commercial and residential area where few buildings exceeded four or five floors . Criticism continued after the construction , and a few years later the city council passed a by-law limiting building heights in the old town to 65 feet ( 19.8 m ) \u2014 a size only exceeded by one other building at the time : the then seven-floor H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec . Nowadays , however , the building is considered an architectural monument in the capital and a defining element of the city 's skyline . When the project for the construction of the Le Phare Qu\u00e9bec project for a major skyscraper in the Sainte-Foy area began attracting criticism , parallels with the major controversies that surrounded \u00c9difice Price 's construction were drawn . = = Architecture = = \u00c9difice Price , despite the original criticism , is considered to be very well integrated with its surroundings , and well adapted to a lot only 24 metres ( 79 ft ) wide . Of its 18 floors , 15 are used as corporate space , two constitute the Premier 's suite , and on top is a mechanical floor . This leads to conflicting numbers quoted for its floors ( 16 , 17 and 18 have been variously reported ) , compounded by the fact the retrofitted extra floors are not visible from outside the building . Two elevators , one of which is used as a freight elevator , provide access to all floors . \u00c9difice Price was constructed in the art deco style of the time , as was the neighbouring Clarendon Hotel , whose extension was completed a few years earlier . The design uses setbacks to gradually taper floor area down , yielding the typical elongated \" wedding cake \" shape which contributes in reducing loads and softens the building 's visual impact on the city 's skyline . The upper setbacks were later used to build balconies . Because the building is deeper than it is wide , it appears much bulkier when viewed from the side . This is reminiscent of Finnish art nouveau architect Eliel Saarinen 's work , and is the stylistic opposite of other buildings in the city such as the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac , whose cantilever construction widens as it gets taller . Geometric motifs are carved in the Price Building 's stone cladding , especially over the first few levels . The building is topped by a more classical , specifically Ch\u00e2teauesque , steepled copper roof , the final composition showing Beaux-Arts influences . The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs , pinnacles and a large vaulted arch with extrados over the main entrance . At ground level and inside the lobby , bas-reliefs depict the origins of the Price company . During the 1920s John M. Lyle , an influential architect of the Beaux-arts school , was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles , and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building . Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a hallway , and a projection at the end of the building references the bow of a ship . The building 's structural steel frame was also a first for the city . It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carri\u00e8res and Queenston . Due to the rapid construction , Saint-Marc-des-Carri\u00e8res was unable to supply enough stone to keep up with demand on the building site , resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source . Saint-Marc-des-Carri\u00e8res limestone is a pearly grey , and becomes a pale beige with age , while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages . = = Price Memorial = = In 2002 , a memorial was unveiled on Sainte-Anne between the Price Building and its right-hand neighbour ( 67 \u2013 71 Sainte-Anne Street , a set of rowhouses ) . The memorial ( French : M\u00e9morial Price ) is in the form of a sculpture , entitled \" L 'Homme-Rivi\u00e8re \" ( \" The River-man \" ) . It was sponsored by the CDP and the Virginia Parker Foundation , and designed by Quebec City artists Lucienne Cornet and Catherine Sylvain . L 'Homme-Rivi\u00e8re is a statue representing a log driver at work . The logs are heavily stylized , reduced to little more than cylinders . The driver and his hook , however , are shown as transforming into a wooden plant . Its location , in a tight space between two tall buildings , gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge . L 'Homme-Rivi\u00e8re is highly dynamic , and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk . The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec , thanks notably to F\u00e9lix-Antoine Savard 's famous novel Menaud , ma\u00eetre draveur . = = Quebec Premier official residence = = An apartment on the 16th and 17th floors has been the official residence of the premier of Quebec since 2001 . These two floors , the highest habitable ones since the 18th floor is taken up by machinery , had originally been reserved for a CDP executive suite . There had been a previous attempt at offering the premier an official residence . In 1994 , the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce had bought a large residence at 1080 rue des Braves and donated it to then premier Jacques Parizeau . There were issues of security and neighbour relationships , however , and Lucien Bouchard declined to use it . He lived in a small apartment on Parliament Hill for most of his mandate . In May 2001 , Bouchard 's successor Bernard Landry , who had until then lived in a three-room apartment , announced that he would accept the SITQ offer of the \u00c9difice Price apartment , and took up occupancy in November . The choice , although praised for its symbolic location , attracted criticism that the apartment , rather small and poorly lit , could not accommodate a family ( Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time ) . Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor 's residence , located at 1010 Chemin Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 for a fraction of its estimated value , would have made an excellent choice . From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building 's second and third floors . This was moved out in 2002 ; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier 's installation to be a complete coincidence . The 2,800 sq ft ( 260 m2 ) apartment cost $ 195,000 to build and decorate . It includes a 14-guest dining room , two bedrooms and all the associated facilities . The Premier also has access to a reception hall on the 14th floor if need be . The apartment is richly appointed with maple hardwood floors , granite and limestone ; its furnishings reproduce traditional Quebec styles , and is decorated with paintings by local artists on loan from the Mus\u00e9e du Qu\u00e9bec . In 2006 , renewed criticism regarding current Premier Jean Charest 's limited use of the apartment led to another proposal for a proper official residence . Charest , who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal , saw little reason to move them across the province . These proposal were never taken further , and Charest 's successor , Pauline Marois , made regular use of the apartment .",
                "Longtown Castle = Longtown Castle , also termed Ewias Lacey in early accounts , is a ruined Norman motte-and-bailey fortification in Longtown , Herefordshire . Built around 1175 by Hugh de Lacy , possibly reusing former Roman earthworks , the castle had an unusual design with three baileys and two large enclosures to protect the neighbouring town . Early in the next century the castle was rebuilt in stone , with a circular keep erected on the motte and a gatehouse constructed between the inner and outer western baileys . By the 14th century , Longtown Castle had fallen into decline . Despite being pressed back into use during the Owain Glynd\u0175r rising in 1403 , it became ruined . In the 21st century the castle is maintained by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction . = = History = = = = = Earlier sites = = = It is uncertain when the first fortification at Longtown was built . The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman , or Anglo-Saxon periods , but this remains uncertain . If Roman defences were constructed at the site , it was probably because of a Roman road that may have run nearby , and the defences may well have then been reused in the building of the current castle , parts of whose earthworks have square , angular corners , similar to those of Roman forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles . = = = Initial construction = = = After the Norman invasion of England and Wales in the late 11th century , a small castle was built at Pont Hedre , close to the site of the current castle , by either Roger de Lacy or Pain fitzJohn in order to protect the river crossing there . Longtown was then probably built to replace this older castle , probably around 1175 , by Hugh de Lacy , a successful favourite of Henry II and an administrator in newly conquered Ireland . Hugh had acquired the local lands around Ewias Lacey , an important Marcher Lord territory , in the 1160s and early 1170s . The early castle was occasionally also called Ewias Lacey , named after the wider lordship ; \" Ewias \" was a term meaning \" sheep district \" . Longtown Castle was designed as a motte and bailey castle , on high ground alongside the River Monnow . More defensible sites on higher ground existed nearby , but this location was strategically well located close to the River , an important transport route . It had a 10-metre ( 33 ft ) high motte and an unusual rectangular bailey design around 125 metres ( 410 ft ) by 110 metres ( 360 ft ) , divided into three parts , two baileys in the west and one in the east , each capable of being defended independently and enclosing around 1.21 hectares ( 3.0 acres ) in total . The 12th-century castle was built primarily of timber with at least some stone in its design , but this stone was then reused when the castle was rebuilt in the 13th century . Two circuits of earthworks to the north and south of the castle , possibly with wooden palisades , enclosed the early settlement of Longtown . The region was troubled for the rest of the century , with revolts by the local Welsh against Anglo-Norman rule . = = = Expansion and decline = = = The castle was extensively rebuilt in stone during the early 13th century . The stone keep , dating from the 1220s or 1230s , was constructed in the form of a circular great tower , with walls 5-metre ( 16 ft ) thick and three turrets spaced evenly around the outside and a hall on the first floor . This circular design is particular to the Welsh Marches , and is also seen at Skenfrith and Caldicot . The reason for this choice is unclear , as it appears to have carried few military advantages . The stonework is made up of shale rubble with cut ashlar detailing ; the walls are around 4-metre ( 13 ft ) thick , but the keep 's foundations are extremely shallow . An inner gate to the western baileys was built to a simple design with two small turrets , and seems to have been fitted with a portcullis , while a 3-metre ( 9.8 ft ) thick wall encircled the rest of the inner western bailey ; another stone wall seems to have protected the outer half of the bailey . Inside the inner western bailey appears to have been the castle 's great hall and other service buildings . The work on the castle cost the de Lacys around \u00a3 37 , a large sum of money for the time . The settlement of Longtown was probably established at the same time as the castle , and initially prospered . The de Lacy family controlled Longtown Castle until Walter de Lacy 's death in 1234 . John Fitzgeoffrey then acquired the castle , during a period of increased conflict and tension between the Welsh princes Llywelyn the Great and Dafydd ap Llywelyn and the English marcher lords . The castle then passed to John Verdon and his sons , who struggled with local lawlessness and the Welsh revolts which continued until the end of the century . Edward temporarily confiscated the castle and estates from John 's son , Theobald Verdon , and in 1316 the castle passed to Bartholomew de Berghersh . The castle continued to be used as a fortification , and in 1317 orders were given to garrison it with 30 men . The castle began to decline in importance , however , and in 1369 passed to the Despensers and then the Beauchamps , neither of whom used the castle . It was temporarily refortified by Henry IV in response to the Owain Glynd\u0175r uprising in North Wales in 1403 . The Nevilles acquired the property in the 15th century and it remained in the control of the Lords of Abergavenny until the 1970s . After the Black Death the town 's population fell away sharply as well , the protected area north of the castle was abandoned , and by the 16th century it was no longer a functioning trading centre . It is unclear if the castle and town played any part in the English Civil War between 1642 \u2013 45 , although cannon balls from the period have been discovered within the castle . Local oral tradition states that the castle was slighted , or deliberately destroyed , during the war . Stones from the castle were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards , and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle , along with a yard and garden . A gallows operated at the castle until 1790 . Buildings continued to encroach on the castle . By the end of the 19th century a school and a house , Castle Lodge , had been built in the castle grounds . Other buildings were built as lean-to 's against the castle walls . = = = 20th - 21st centuries = = = Longtown Castle was acquired by the Ministry of Works in the 1970s . It was in a poor condition and extensive restoration work was carried out , including the removal of many of the buildings that had encroached on the walls . In the 21st century , the central parts of Longtown Castle , including the ruined keep , the internal gatehouse and fragments of the curtain wall , are maintained by English Heritage as a tourist attraction , although the wider earthworks lie on common land . The castle is protected as a scheduled monument .",
                "Ganting Grand Mosque = The Ganting Grand Mosque ( Indonesian : Masjid Raya Ganting ; also written and pronounced Gantiang in Minang ) is a Sunni mosque located in Ganting , Padang , West Sumatra , Indonesia . Construction began in 1805 , making it the oldest in Padang and one of the oldest in Indonesia . It is a Cultural Property of Indonesia . The building , which involved persons from various cultural backgrounds in its construction , was the centre of an Islamic reform in the area during the 19th century . Future president Sukarno spent a time of exile at the mosque in 1942 . It survived the tsunami which struck Padang following the 1833 Sumatra earthquake , but was severely damaged after earthquakes in 2005 and 2009 . The one-floor establishment continues to be used as a center for prayer , as well as religious education ; it also functions as a pesantren for the community . The mosque is also a tourist attraction . = = Early history = = According to Abdul Baqir Zein , the mosque was first built in 1700 at the foot of Mount Padang , then moved to the bank of Batang Arau , as the Dutch colonial government intended to use the previous location to build a road to Emma Haven Port . It was later moved to its present location . However , the Indonesian Department of Religion documents the mosque as having been constructed in 1790 with a wooden frame and a roof made from Sago palms . According to this documentation , a sturdier mosque was built in 1805 . Another history of the mosque , from the Culture and Tourism Department of the City of the Padang , suggests that the mosque was first constructed in 1805 . The small mosque had stone flooring , wood and dirt walls , and a pyramidal ceiling like the mosques in Java . The construction of the mosque was spearheaded by three local figures , Angku Gapuak ( a rich merchant ) , Angku Syekh Haji Uma ( the village chief ) , and Angku Syekh Kapalo Koto ( an ulama ) , while the funds were provided by Minang businesspeople and ulamas throughout Sumatra . It was erected on waqf land donated by locals and located in the center of the city 's Minang district . Construction of the mosque finished in 1810 ; it measured 30 by 30 metres ( 98 ft \u00d7 98 ft ) and had a fence 4 metres ( 13 ft ) out from the mosque . Since its establishment , the mosque has been used to counsel future hajj participants . It also served as the first point of departure for hajj participants from Central Sumatra , who left Sumatra via Emma Haven after the port was opened in 1895 . Before the end of the Padri War , in 1818 the Minang Ulamas held a meeting at Ganting to discuss the steps they would take to eliminate mysticism and superstition from Islam on the island . In 1833 a large earthquake on the west coast of Sumatra struck up a tsunami which destroyed much of Padang . The mosque was one of several buildings which survived the tsunami . Its stone floor was later replaced by a mixture of clam shells and pumice . = = Modern history = = The floor had received work beginning in 1900 , when tiles from the Netherlands , ordered through Jacobson van den Berg . The tiles were installed by a company-appointed worker ; installation was completed in 1910 . That year , the Dutch established a cement factory in Indarung , Padang . To transport the cement to the port at Emma Haven , the Dutch built a stone road in front of Ganting Grand Mosque ; this road took up roughly a third of the waqf land the mosque had been built on . As compensation , the Dutch sent the Genie Command Corps of West Sumatra ( an area that includes modern day West Sumatra and Tapanuli ) . The corps expanded the front chamber until it was 20 metres ( 66 ft ) in length ; they also built a Portuguese style fa\u00e7ade . The mosque 's floor was replaced with cement imported from Germany . Meanwhile , ethnic Chinese under Captain Lo Chian Ko began working on an octagonal dome , resembling the top of a vihara . The mihrab for the imam to lead prayers and preach was given Chinese-style carvings . In 1921 Abdul Karim Amrullah established the Thawalib Schools in Padang mosques , including Ganting , to better educate the local populace in Islam . The alumni later established the Persatuan Muslim Indonesia ( Permi ) , under the Masyumi Party . The mosque was the location of the first national jamboree of Muhammadiyah 's scouting organisation , Hizbul Wathan , in 1932 . When the Japanese began occupying the Indies in 1942 , Sukarno \u2013 at the time a Dutch prisoner in Bengkulu \u2013 was evacuated to Kutacane . However , once they reached Painan they discovered that the Japanese forces had already occupied Bukittinggi ; this quashed hopes of bringing Sukarno to Barus in Tapanuli . The Dutch left Sukarno in Painan . Hizbul Wathan members , at the time based out of Ganting , went to retrieve Sukarno and bring him to Padang by cart . For several days after arriving in Padang , Sukarno slept at the mosque ; he also delivered a speech . During the three-year Japanese occupation the mosque served as the military 's headquarters in central and western Sumatra . It also functioned as a training camp for Gyugun and Heiho soldiers , military units formed by the Japanese which consisted of native soldiers ; the Gyugun was formed by the ulamas , while the Heihos were taken from the santri . After the Allies landed in Sumatra , many of the Muslim Indian soldiers brought by the English deserted and joined the native revolutionaries . They planned strategy in the mosque , including the assault on a British barracks . One of these Indian soldiers , who had died in the assault , was buried at the mosque . Since 1950 , after Indonesia 's independence was recognised , the Ganting Grand Mosque has hosted numerous statesmen from both Indonesia and abroad , including Vice President Mohammad Hatta , Minister of Defence Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX , and General Abdul Haris Nasution . Foreign dignitaries who have visited the mosque included people from Malaysia , Saudi Arabia , and Egypt . Construction on the mosque has continued . In 1960 the mosque 's 25 columns , originally constructed from brick , were covered in ceramic tiles ; seven years later , this was followed seven years later by the construction of minarets on the left and right of the dome . In 1995 , the walls of the main chamber were covered in tile . On 10 April 2005 an aftershock measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale struck the west coast of Sumatra two weeks after a larger earthquake struck Nias . This caused crackage to the columns supporting the mosque 's roof . Three years later , the Ganting Grand Mosque was one of 608 places of worship severely damaged when another large earthquake struck the area on 30 September 2009 . The earthquake collapsed part of the mosque 's fa\u00e7ade and caused severe structural damage to the interior columns ; as a result , the community feared that the mosque would collapse . Before renovations were completed in 2010 , prayers had to be held in the yard . In 2011 the Ganting Grand Mosque was listed as one of Indonesia 's 100 most beautiful mosques in a book compiled by Andalan Media . The only other mosque from West Sumatra included was Raya Bayur Mosque , Agam Regency . = = Architecture = = Ganting Grand Mosque is built on land measuring 102 by 95.6 metres ( 335 ft \u00d7 314 ft ) ; the mosque itself is 42 by 39 metres ( 138 ft \u00d7 128 ft ) . The building has verandas on its front and sites , a mihrab , and a central area . The extra land can hold more people during the Eid prayers , on both Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha . The courtyard is surrounded by an iron fence , separating it from the busy streets on the eastern and northern sides of the mosque . On the southern side , as well as behind the mosque proper , there are numerous graves , including that of Angku Syekh Haji Uma , one of the mosque 's founders . The architectural blend of numerous schools shows clearly because of the different cultural groups involved in the mosque 's construction , including the architecture of Europe , the Middle East , China , and the Minangkabau . The mosque 's roof goes upwards in five steps , with the dome at the top ; the first step is square , while the rest are octagonal . Each part of the roof has slits in it for lighting . = = = Veranda = = = The mosque proper has two main verandas , at the fa\u00e7ade and its side . Both verandas measure 30 by 4.5 metres ( 98 ft \u00d7 15 ft ) and have two doorways , one of which leads to the rooms for wudu located on the northern and southern sides of the mosque . On the western side of the mosque is a room ( ribat ) for its keeper , measuring 4.5 by 3 metres ( 14.8 ft \u00d7 9.8 ft ) . The ribat has a 225-by-90-centimetre ( 89 in \u00d7 35 in ) door facing east and a window measuring 90 by 90 centimetres ( 35 in \u00d7 35 in ) . The forward veranda measures 12 by 39 metres ( 39 ft \u00d7 128 ft ) and has six doorways to the east and two each to the north and south ; in each doorway hangs an iron grate door . Each of the east facing doorways is decorated with a pair of non-supporting columns . In the center of the veranda is the 220 by 120 by 275 centimetres ( 87 in \u00d7 47 in \u00d7 108 in ) minbar , which juts out to the front and has an iron grate door . The minbar is only used during Eid prayers . Aside from the doors , the veranda has two windows with iron trellises , one each to the north and south . On the eastern wall of the front veranda hangs a geometric carving created with square and rectangular panels . There are also arc designs which merge into ring and axehead shapes . The walls measure 34 centimetres ( 13 in ) thick and 320 centimetres ( 130 in ) high . Inside the veranda there are seven double iron-wrought cylindrical columns with a diameter of 45 centimetres ( 18 in ) . These columns rest on concrete pedestals measuring 113 by 70 by 67 centimetres ( 44 in \u00d7 28 in \u00d7 26 in ) . There are also two square columns on the northern and southern sides , near a central , octagonal room which has one doorway from the east and one window . = = = Main chamber = = = The main chamber is a 30-by-30-metre ( 98 ft \u00d7 98 ft ) square , with eight entrances on the east and due each on the north and south . The doors measure 160 by 264 centimetres ( 63 in \u00d7 104 in ) and have wooden doors with spread fan carvings on the threshold above . There are two windows with wooden frames on the eastern wall , flanking the doors , as well as three windows on both the north and south walls and eight on the west . These windows measure 1.6 by 2 metres ( 5 ft 3 in \u00d7 6 ft 7 in ) . As with the doors , the threshold above the windows is decorated with spread fan carvings . The walls are made of concrete covered in ceramic , while the floor is made of white tiles with a flower motif . This main room includes 25 soko guru , or main columns . They are hexagonal in shape and with diameters ranging from 40 to 50 centimetres ( 16 to 20 in ) . These columns are made of red brick and bound with egg whites , lacking any iron framework . The 25 columns are arranged in 5 rows , representing the 25 prophets in Islam . Each column is covered in marble engraved with the names of the prophets , from Adam to Muhammad . These columns are the main supports for the octagonal roof above . On the western side of the room is a mihrab flanked by two smaller rooms on its north and south . The mihrab measures 2 by 1.5 metres ( 6 ft 7 in \u00d7 4 ft 11 in ) . It is 320 centimetres ( 130 in ) tall on the east side and 210 centimetres ( 83 in ) tall on the west side . = = = Other areas = = = The Ganting Grand Mosque Masjid has wudu chambers measuring 10 by 3 metres ( 32.8 ft \u00d7 9.8 ft ) on the north and south sides of the side verandas . These enclosed chambers were built as permanent structures in 1967 . The mosque 's library is in a structure on the northern side of the mosque , which is connected to the mosque proper . There are also three smaller structures on the grounds for the consultation of future hajj pilgrims . One of the structures was once part of the a Thawalib school .",
                "St Cristiolus 's Church , Llangristiolus = St Cristiolus 's Church , Llangristiolus is a medieval church near the village of Llangristiolus , in Anglesey , north Wales . The village , about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) from the building , takes its name from the church . Reputedly founded by St Cristiolus in 610 , the present building dates from the 12th and 13th centuries . Alterations were made in the 16th century , when the large east window in Perpendicular style was added to the chancel \u2013 a window which has been described by one guide to the buildings of north Wales as \" almost too big to fit \" in the wall . Some restoration work took place in the mid-19th century , when further windows were added and the chancel largely rebuilt . The church is still in use for weekly Sunday services ( in Welsh and English ) , as part of the Church in Wales , and is one of four churches in a combined parish . It is a Grade II * listed building , a national designation given to \" particularly important buildings of more than special interest \" , in particular because of its age and the east window . The church contains a decorated font from the 12th century , as well as memorials from the 18th , 19th and 20th centuries . Richard Owen , a 19th-century Calvinistic Methodist minister from Llangristiolus , is buried in the graveyard . = = History and location = = St Cristiolus 's Church is in central Anglesey , north Wales . It is situated just to the south of the A5 and A55 roads , on raised ground above Malltraeth Marsh . The modern village of Llangristiolus is about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) to the west of the church . The village takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , and \" -gristiolus \" is a modified form of the saint 's name . The date of foundation of the first building on this site is unknown . Geraint Jones , in a 2006 guide to Anglesey churches , wrote that it is thought that St Cristiolus established a church here in 610 . Cristiolus , a 7th-century saint about whom little detail is known , was a follower of St Cadfan , a Breton saint associated with the Christian community on Bardsey Island in Wales . Cristiolus is also credited with the foundation of the church in Eglwyswrw in modern-day Pembrokeshire , south Wales . He was the brother of St Rhystud , who established the church at Llanrhystud in mid-Wales . The present building dates from the 12th century ; it is the only medieval building in the parish . During the 13th century , the chancel was extended , and the older part of the church may have been rebuilt using the previous stones at this time . By 1535 , the position of rector of the parish was held by the person holding the position of Archdeacon of Anglesey , as part of the remuneration for that office ; this is no longer the case . Further structural changes to the church were made in the early 16th century when some windows were added to the chancel . In 1852 , restoration work took place to the nave and chancel under Henry Kennedy , architect of the Diocese of Bangor . The chancel was rebuilt , although the east wall and window were retained , and further windows were added in the church . St Cristiolus 's Church is still in regular use and belongs to the Church in Wales . It is one of six churches in the combined benefice of Plwyf Seintiau Braint a Chefni . The other churches in the benefice are St Michael 's , Gaerwen ; St Ffinan 's , Llanffinan ; St Caffo 's , Llangaffo ; St Edwen 's , Llanedwen ; and St Mary 's , Llanfairpwll . It is within the deanery of Malltraeth , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . The current incumbent ( as of 2013 ) , Emlyn Williams , was appointed as vicar of St Cristiolus 's Church in 2007 ; before that , the position had been vacant for 20 years despite many attempts by the Church in Wales to fill it . He is assisted by one associate priest and two associate curates . Services are held every Sunday morning , alternating between a bilingual service of Holy Communion and a service of Morning Prayer ; there are no midweek services . People associated with the church include Henry Maurice ( elected Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford shortly before his death in 1691 ; his father , Thomas , was the perpetual curate of the church ) and the 19th-century writer and priest Owen Wynne Jones ( who was the curate for a time in the early 1860s ) . The 19th-century Calvinistic Methodist preacher Richard Owen was born in the parish , and is buried in the graveyard that surrounds the church . = = Architecture and fittings = = The church is built from rubble masonry ( mainly gritstone ) and dressed with freestone . The nave measures 44 feet 9 inches long by 15 feet 6 inches wide ( 13.6 by 4.7 m ) and the chancel measures 32 feet 9 inches long by 20 feet 6 inches ( 10 by 6.25 m ) wide . The nave has three bays , and the chancel at the east end of the nave has two bays ; it is slightly wider than the nave . The nave and the chancel have external buttresses . Internally , the chancel arch dates from the 13th century . It is 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) wide and 19 feet ( 5.8 m ) from the floor to the top of the arch ; the supporting pillars are 10 feet ( 3.0 m ) tall . There are windows from the early 16th century in the chancel , with the large east window in Perpendicular style ( in contrast to the rest of the church , which is mainly in Decorated style ) . It has five ogee-headed lights separated by vertical tracery , and measures 10 feet 10 inches ( 3.3 m ) at its widest point by 14 feet 2 inches ( 4.3 m ) at its tallest . Unlike most of the other windows in the church , it contains coloured glass . A smaller window in the north wall also dates from this time , and has a square frame containing two lights ; a matching window was added in the 19th century in the opposite wall . The other windows in the church are from the 19th century in various designs . One window , in the north wall of the nave , has had stained glass added as a memorial to two local residents who died in the 1990s . The entrance is through a porch ( probably dating from the 16th century ) on the south side of the building , at the west end of the nave . At the west end of the roof , which is made of slate , there is an ornate bellcote for one bell ( added by Kennedy ) . There are plain iron crosses on top of the porch and the chancel . Inside , the rafters and trusses of the roof are exposed . The pews and choir stalls were added in the 19th century . The nave has a brass memorial to a former Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral , William Morgan ( died 1713 ) , his wife and son . There are other memorials inside the church , including one for those from the parish who died during the First World War . The gritstone circular font , at the west end , dates from the 12th century , and has six decorative panels . It is one of a group of fonts in north-west Wales using interlace ( a medieval decorative style ) showing links to Irish and Norse artistic traditions ; other similar fonts in Anglesey are found at St Ceinwen 's , Cerrigceinwen , St Peter 's , Newborough and St Beuno 's , Trefdraeth . One author says that the patterns on the fonts at Llangristiolus and St Beuno 's Church , Pistyll ( in the nearby county of Gwynedd ) seem \" closely linked \" to patterns on one of the stone crosses at St Seiriol 's Church , Penmon . = = Churchyard = = The churchyard contains six Commonwealth war graves : in the east part of the ground are buried two British Army soldiers of World War I and north-north-west of the church are buried three soldiers and an airman of World War II . = = Assessment = = The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II * listed building \u2013 the second-highest ( of three ) grade of listing , designating \" particularly important buildings of more than special interest \" . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 , and has been listed because it is a medieval church that , unusually for Anglesey , dates substantially from the 12th and 13th centuries . Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the \" fine 16th-century rebuilding of the chancel \" and the chancel window . The chancel arch has been described ( in a 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales ) as the best such arch in the region , and the \" fine \" east window as \" almost too big to fit \" in the wall . The 19th-century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church as \" a spacious structure , exhibiting some excellent architectural details , and decorated with an east window , of good design , enriched with tracery . \" Writing in 1846 ( before Kennedy 's restoration work in 1852 ) , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones noted a wooden gallery at the west end , above the font , inscribed RICHARDUS DE GREY FECIT 1778 . LAUS DEO . He described the chancel arch as displaying \" workmanship of good character . \" The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1849 . He wrote that it was a \" fair specimen of the better sort of Anglesey village church \" . The nave and chancel were \" of good proportions \" , with the chancel \" properly distinguished and developed \" . He also said that the chancel arch was \" of considerable elegance , unusual in North Wales , having excellent moulding and clustered shafts which have a Middle Pointed character . \""

                    "text": "Cleeve Abbey = Cleeve Abbey is a medieval monastery located near the village of Washford , in Somerset , England . It is a Grade I listed building and has been scheduled as an ancient monument . The abbey was founded in the late twelfth century as a house for monks of the austere Cistercian order . Over its 350-year monastic history Cleeve was undistinguished amongst the abbeys of its order , frequently ill-governed and often financially troubled . The sole member of the community to achieve prominence was John Hooper , who became a bishop during the Reformation . In 1536 Cleeve was closed by Henry VIII in the course of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was converted into a country house . Subsequently , the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains . In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care ; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public . Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain . While the church is no longer standing , the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of particular interest including the ' angel ' roof in the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber . = = Foundation = = The abbey was founded by William de Roumare , Earl of Lincoln in a grant of 1191 , on land he had been given by king \u00c6thelred the Unready . On 25 June 1198 a colony of 12 monks led by Abbot Ralph arrived at the site from Revesby Abbey in Lincolnshire . The official name of the abbey was Vallis Florida , ( Latin : ' Flowering Valley ' ) but throughout its history it was generally known as Cleeve after the nearby village . The initial funding for the foundation was increased by land and money from the family of William de Mohun of Dunster , 1st Earl of Somerset and the Beckerolles family . In addition to various landholdings with produced rent for the abbey they held the Right of Wreck , which meant they could claim shipwrecks washed up on the shore of their lands . = = Abbey buildings = = Work immediately began on constructing the abbey church , a task that took many decades . It was a conservative design , heavily influenced by the thoughts of St. Bernard and the order 's early churches in its homeland of Burgundy . It was cruciform in shape with an aisled nave of seven bays , a short , square east end , and transepts each with two side chapels . The eastern parts of the church were built first , and were likely finished in 1232 , at which point the abbey received a royal donation of oak to build choir stalls . The remainder was probably completed by mid-century . To the south of the church a cloister was laid out , surrounded by the domestic buildings of the house . The east range , which was completed first ( probably by around 1250 ) , held the chapter house , sacristy , the monks ' dormitory , day room , and a 19.7 metres ( 65 ft ) long reredorter ( latrine ) . The south range was built next , it contained the kitchens , warming house and refectory which projected south beyond the main body of the building , following the usual Cistercian plan . It is suggested from the heraldry used in the tiled floors of the refectory that it was finished at the end of the thirteenth century . The Encaustic tiles , which are 23 centimetres ( 9.1 in ) square , include the arms of Henry III , Richard , 1st Earl of Cornwall and the Clare family . It is believed they were produced to celebrate the marriage of Edmund , 2nd Earl of Cornwall and Margaret de Clare in 1272 . The final part to be finished was the small west range , which was used for storage and quarters for the lay brothers . East of the core buildings , and linked to them , was a second cloister around which was the monastic infirmary . The monastery , which is next to the River Washford , would have been surrounded by gardens , fishponds , orchards , barns , guesthouses , stables , a farmyard and industrial buildings . The abbey grounds were defended by a water filled moat and a gatehouse . Excavation has revealed that a large stone cross , like a market cross , stood just west of the main building . Though Cleeve was by no means a wealthy house , the monks were able to make significant investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period . In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome tiled floors ( an expensive and high status product ) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken . A wooden shelter was constructed over the tiled floor in 2016 . Abbot David Juyner ( r . 1435 \u2013 87 ) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery . He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor . This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling ( carved with angels ) was the equal of the hall of any contemporary secular lord . Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments . These were probably used by corrodians , pensioners of the abbey . Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects . Some of these wall paintings survive . As well as one depicting the Crucifixion , there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of , and facing , a man standing on a bridge : the bridge is over water full of fish , and the man has an angel on either side of his head , and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge , and a dragon to his right . Work continued under Juyner 's successors to the eve of the Dissolution . The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse , performed after 1510 , though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion . As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey , this was never completed , due to the dissolution of the abbey . = = Monastic history = = Like most of the smaller Cistercian houses , comparatively little is known about the internal history of the abbey . In its early years Cleeve received grants of land and property from local lords and the Crown to supplement its initial endowment and in the prosperous years of the thirteenth century grew steadily , reaching 26 monks in 1297 . The abbey held various local churches , including those at Cleeve , Queen Camel , Woolavington while also holding the rectory of Lundy . The abbey was also responsible for the chapel of Our Lady between Old Cleeve and what is now Blue Anchor ; however although this has since disappeared , the inn for pilgrims attending the chapel has been expanded into the present Chapel Cleeve Manor . A major source of income was the export of wool . However , the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes : the Black Death , a worsening economic climate and poor administration left the abbey ( like many others of its order ) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt . The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too : in 1400 \u2013 01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region . However , things improved in the fifteenth century and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots , better management , access to new resources ( for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown ) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability . = = Dissolution = = In 1535 , the abbey 's income was only assessed at \u00a3 155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus , Henry VIII 's great survey of church finances . It meant the following year that it came under the terms of the first Suppression Act , Henry 's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries . Abbot William Dovell and his 16 monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536 . There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king 's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve , as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were , however , it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537 . Abbot William was given a pension of 40 marks per year , not large but certainly comfortable , which he was still drawing 20 years later . Most of the other monks were given pensions too . One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end . This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I. = = Later history = = Soon after Cleeve became Crown property , it was leased to Anthony Busterd for 21 years . In 1538 , the freehold of the site was granted to Robert Radcliffe , 1st Earl of Sussex . The church was demolished , save for the south wall which bounded the cloister , and the rest of the abbey converted into a mansion suitable for a gentleman . By the early seventeenth century , however , Cleeve had turned into a farm . The dormitory was now a large barn , the cloister was the farmyard and the rest of the buildings were used for agricultural purposes and a farm house . A red sandstone barn was built which abuts the south-west corner of the abbey . George Luttrell of Dunster Castle acquired the site in 1870 . The abbey stopped being used as a farm and extensive archaeological excavations took place . The farm house was converted into rental cottages , and the site became a tourist attraction , partly to bring traffic to the West Somerset Railway . Cleeva Clapp a local farmers daughter , who was named after the abbey , acted as a guide and described her nightly \" communings \" with the ghosts of the monks for a shilling a head . Cleeve Abbey was passed back to the Crown in 1950 \u2013 51 to pay Death Duties on the Luttrell estate and was managed by the Department for the Environment . Major restoration and archaeological work followed . In 1984 , English Heritage took over responsibility for Cleeve Abbey , carrying out excavations and earthwork surveys and continues to care for it today . = = Present day = = The church and infirmary have almost entirely vanished , but the site boasts some of the finest and best-preserved monks ' living quarters still surviving in southern England . The buildings round the cloister are still roofed and habitable and many of the rooms retain their vaults . Among the most important preserved rooms are the chapter house , the refectory with its magnificent arch braced wooden vault and the painted chamber . Much of the abbey 's medieval tiled flooring remains . Other major survivals include the abbey gatehouse , which still provides entrance to the visitor , the moat and fishponds . Cleeve is open to the public . The remains of the buildings have been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building , and it is listed as a Scheduled monument . = = Cultural references = = The Abbey was the original site on which ' Gracedieu ' , the setting for the Abbey Series of books by Elsie J. Oxenham , was based . Many of its features described by Oxenham , who visited Cleeve in the early years of the twentieth century , can be identified at the site today , although literary licence allowed her to add features from elsewhere or from her imagination . The castle scenes in the children 's musical-comedy television series Maid Marian and her Merry Men were filmed in Cleeve Abbey .",

After the Jesuits established the Christian community in Baclayon , they moved to Loboc and established a second Christian settlement in Bohol . The parish was established in 1602 , and the present coral stone church was completed in 1734 . Because of its strategic location , it became the center of the Jesuit mission in the Bohol area . In 1768 , upon the expulsion of the Jesuits , the town was transferred to the Augustinian Recollects . The church is classified as a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines and a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines . It was considered for the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines as a member of two categories , the Baroque Churches of the Philippines ( Extension ) and the Jesuit Churches of the Philippines . It was severely damaged when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Bohol and other parts of Central Visayas on October 15 , 2013 . = = Church history = = After the establishment of the Jesuit mission in Bohol , Father Juan de Torres , SJ , moved to the community along the Loboc River in late 1596 to establish a second mission station . The first church , made of wood , was built by the people of the area on a site called Calvario , Sawang , near the location of the present-day church . It was dedicated under the patronage of Saint Michael the Archangel . Loboc officially became a Catholic parish in 1602 . Due to pirate attacks on Baclayon and the strategic position of Loboc , the Jesuits chose Loboc to become the center of their mission . The Jesuit superior of Bohol later resided in Loboc until the Jesuits ' expulsion in 1768 . A boarding school for boys , the Seminario de los Indios , was established at Loboc in 1605 . Fire destroyed the original wooden church in 1638 ; it was later reconstructed by the Jesuit priest Jose Sanchez . A larger church was built in 1670 , on the site of the present day convent . The present coral stone church was finished in 1734 . After the Jesuits were expelled from the country in May 1768 , the Augustinian Recollects assumed the administration of the parish and the church that November . = = = Historical and cultural designations = = = In 1998 , Loboc Church was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Institute , now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines . It was also listed as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines . The church complex was a candidate for UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines , under two distinct categories . The Jesuit Churches of the Philippines nomination includes the churches of Maragondon in Cavite , Baclayon in Bohol and Guiuan in Eastern Samar . The Baroque Churches of the Philippines ( Extension ) nomination , nominates Loboc Church along with the churches of Patrocinio de Maria in Boljoon , Cebu , La Inmaculada Concepcion in Guiuan , Eastern Samar , San Matias in Tumauini , Isabela , and San Isidro Labrador in Lazi , Siquijor . However , due to its total destruction , it was removed from the roster of nominated sites . = = Architecture = = The church is built along the banks of the Loboc River . The coral stone church follows a cruciform plan , with a sunken pyramidal roof on its crossing . As a church built by the Jesuits , exterior walls of the church have the Jesuit insignia and icons of an angel 's wing and head . Major renovations were undertaken by Augustinian priest Father Aquilino Bon , including the addition of a portico to the fa\u00e7ade ( 1863 \u2013 1866 ) and re-roofing with tiles ( 1873 ) . Father Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez , OAR , added stone buttresses to the walls ( 1891 \u2013 1893 ) and side porticoes ( 1895 \u2013 1896 ) . Because of frequent flooding , its wooden flooring was changed to cement tiles in 1895 and was elevated in 1969 . = = = Interior = = = The interior of the church is adorned with ceiling paintings by Canuto Avila and his sons , Ricardo and Ray Francia , created from May 1926 to July 1927 , and retouched by Cris Naparota in 1995 . A mural of Our Lady of Guadalupe , secondary patron of Loboc , painted by Max Aya-ay in 1930 at the center of the nave depicts the Virgin saving Loboc from floods . The church also has a separate cantilevered organ loft , hosting a large pipe organ believed to be connected with Father Diego Cera , maker of the Las Pi\u00f1as Bamboo organ . = = = = Fa\u00e7ade = = = = The inner baroque fa\u00e7ade , which is part of the 1734 church built by the Jesuits , is decorated with pilasters , capitals , blind niches and volutes . It is patterned after the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros , with two levels , a triangular pediment , and two narrow octagonal bell towers on each side . The neoclassical portico houses niches for Saint Peter and Saint Paul . Along the pediment is a wooden bas-relief on galvanized iron of the papal tiara over crossed keys ( the symbol of Saint Peter ) on the center and medallions carrying the icons of the Augustinians and Saint Peter on both ends . = = = = Altars = = = = The church has five retablos ( reredos ) . The central retablo ( or retablo mayor ) at the altar houses images of Saint Peter , the patron , paired with Saint Paul on the uppermost niche . On the lowest level are images of Our Lady of Guadalupe , a secondary patron , in the center . Also on the lowest level were statues of Saint Lucy , patron against typhoons and Saint Francis Xavier , patron against floods and alligators . Both Saint Lucy and Saint Francis were elected patrons in 1697 . Behind the walls of the retablo mayor are the remains of the former Jesuit altarpiece , a bas-relief of Saint Ignatius Loyola and St Francis Xavier dressed as a pilgrim . = = = = = Epistle retablo = = = = = On the right side of the altar are two retablos . The larger altar on the right side currently houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on the topmost level . On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center , and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches , respectively . The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolacion in the center , Saint Anne to the right and Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux ( originally St Joachim ) on the left . The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style , respectively , with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper . The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also on this side of the church . The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros . An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes ' tomb ; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns , which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes . = = = = = Gospel retablo = = = = = On the left side of the altar are also two retablos . The larger altar , which is a twin of the altar opposite it , houses an image of a unidentified saint on the topmost level , presumably Michael the Archangel , and the crucified Christ ( originally Madonna and Child ) in the center , Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left , and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches . The original images on the lowest level have been replaced . The smaller retablo , also of the same style , houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus , and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level , respectively . In the sacristy is another retablo , with a crucifix in its central niche .

It was built parallel to the transept and was an unusual three-storey structure , with a two-storey outdoor gallery ( called a volada ) and thick walls . It is the only convent in the Philippines with three storeys . An extension perpendicular to the convent was built in the middle of the 19th century . The convent was also adorned with paintings on its walls and ceilings , and with colored glass on its windows and cornices on the kitchen . The roof was replaced with galvanized iron in 1888 . The third floor of the convent is now used as an ecclesiastical museum ( known as Loboc Museum ) , containing several religious artifacts , such as a 1786 silver missal and 18th century wooden Santo Ni\u00f1o . = = = = Belltower = = = = A detached four-storey bell tower was built near the riverbanks by the first Augustinian Recollect priest of Loboc . It has seven bells , with the 1863 bell being the oldest and the 1937 bell , named for Father Cayetano Bastes , being the largest . It also has a large wooden ratchet , installed in 1899 , used during Holy Week , and a clock made by the Altonaga Company , installed in 1893 . = = = = Mortuary chapel = = = = A hexagonal mortuary is located on the left side of the fa\u00e7ade .

It is 140 feet ( 43 m ) high and has 10 floors . Covering an entire city block , it is the largest privately owned office building in the District of Columbia . Current tenants include the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency . As of February 2014 , Constitution Center was worth $ 725.8 million , making it the most valuable , taxable property in the city . = = Original structure = = In the 1950s , the U.S. Congress , then the governing institution of the District of Columbia , undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project , the first in the capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation . In 1946 , Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act , which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency ( RLA ) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital . Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission ( NCPC ) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped , and how . The RLA was not funded , however , until passage of the Housing Act of 1949 . A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings , overcrowding , and threats to public health ( such as lack of running indoor water , sewage systems , electricity , central heating , and indoor toilets ) . Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods , but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding . Original plans called for the demolition of almost all structures in Southwest Washington beginning in 1950 , but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s . Issues surrounding the planning and construction of L 'Enfant Plaza ( immediately to the west of the site ) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s . In 1963 , the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church , Fifth Baptist Church , and homeowners . The United States Department of Health , Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters , but the RLA declined to sell the property . ( The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns , and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base . ) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29 , 1965 , but there were no buyers . The building was constructed pursuant to an agreement between the General Services Administration ( GSA ) and Boston developer David Nassif , Sr. In July 1965 , President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation . GSA ( the property owner and manager for the U.S. federal government ) began seeking to lease or build a structure to house the new agency in late 1965 . Donald T. Kirwan , chief of GSA 's leasing division , knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation , and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size . Nassif approached the RLA on April 21 , 1966 , and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th , 7th , D , and E Streets SW . In May 1967 , GSA sent a letter to Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build . The $ 5.9 million land purchase was finalized on October 30 , 1967 . The cost of the structure is unclear . On November 15 , 1967 , Nassif had secured a $ 39 million construction loan . But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $ 27 million in July 1968 . The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $ 26.5 million . The building was designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone , who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts . On April 11 , 1968 , GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $ 98 million . John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor . Construction began in July 1968 ( although it was delayed for a very short time when unionized ironworkers at the site went on strike ) and was completed in 1969 . The main entrance faced 7th Street SW . It included a central courtyard ( open to the sky ) which featured a fountain , footpaths , benches , and landscaping . Four 15-foot ( 4.6 m ) high arcades pierced the building in the center of the block on each side , creating access to the courtyard . The facade 's vertical marble ribs were obtained from the same quarry near Carrara , Italy , that provided the marble for the Kennedy Center . The finished building had 10 floors , three basement floors , overhanging eaves , and 2,500,000 square feet ( 230,000 m2 ) of space ( 1,019,000 square feet ( 94,700 m2 ) of usable space ) . It was the largest privately owned office building in the city at the time . Kirwan 's contacts with Nassif later became the subject of a legal investigation . Kirwan not only shared inside information with Nassif about leasing plans of the GSA , he later invested in Nassif 's D.C. business and became an officer in it . This relationship ( Kirwan left GSA in December 1966 , before the letter indicating intention to lease was set to Nassif ) , and GSA 's irregular leasing of the building , became public knowledge in August 1970 . An internal GSA audit was critical of the leasing process and the costs of the lease . That same month , refinancing of the building was called into question . In the U.S. , it is common business practice for the initial lender to provide an interim loan ( the \" construction loan \" ) to build a building . The interim loan is then paid off by a second lender , who becomes the mortgage lender and receives payments from the building 's owner . Riggs Bank , a local D.C. bank , had provided the interim construction loan to Nassif . The New York City Employees Retirement System was to have paid off this construction loan . That payment was halted when the loan officer Nassif had dealt with was indicted for taking bribes to approve loans . When the pension fund refused to provide the loan , Riggs Bank sued for payment and threatened to foreclose on the Nassif Building . From 1969 until 2007 , the Nassif Building served as the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) . The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space . In November 1970 , the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers . Over the years , so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome . David Nassif Associates , owner of the building , disputed these claims . However , when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000 , the owners promised a $ 100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay . The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building . The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007 . The L 'Enfant Plaza Metro station opened an escalator entrance in the structure 's north arcade on July 1 , 1977 . The entrance was one of two which opened that day ( Metro Blue Line 's opening day ) . The third entrance ( inside the L 'Enfant Promenade underground shopping center at L 'Enfant Plaza ) opened in October 1977 . In June 1992 , Virginia Railway Express opened the $ 1.1 million VRE L 'Enfant Station on Virginia Avenue SE ( about a half block north of Constitution Center ) . = = Renovation = = In 2006 , Nassif Associates announced a $ 220 million renovation of the building and renamed it \" Constitution Center \" . SmithGroup was the architectural firm overseeing the redesign , and Davis Construction oversaw the construction . The renovation included some of the highest security features of any building in the D.C. area . They included a central and perimeter security system ; closing of the central plaza of the building , which , along with other changes , increased its interior footage by 80,000 square feet ( 7,400 m2 ) ; steel-jacketed underground parking garage columns capable of withstanding a powerful explosion ; six fully staffed security screening points ; concrete blockades built into the fa\u00e7ade ; communication , potable water , and utilities contained in blast-proof spaces ; ventilation shafts for the parking garage in a secure area ; and special security procedures to obtain access to the building 's critical systems . The security enhancements made the office building suitable for all federal agencies with the exception of the United States Department of Defense . The 700,000-square-foot ( 65,000 m2 ) underground parking garage contains 1,500 spaces . Several amenities were also added to the building . These included a 10,000-square-foot ( 930 m2 ) , 400-seat auditorium on the courtyard / plaza level ; a six-room , 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) conference center which can accommodate meetings of 10 to 500 people ; a full-service cafeteria on the plaza level , with access to the courtyard ; and a fitness center for 100 people . The exterior of the building was also radically changed . The celebrated key visual feature of the building , its exterior vertical white marble ribbing , was completely removed after it was found to be bowed from age and weather . Although this fundamentally changed the nature of Durrell 's building , there was almost no public outcry . It was replaced by an energy-efficient , all-glass facade . Perhaps the most significant renovation feature was the structure 's use of a chilled beam HVAC system , which uses chilled or heated water circulated in strategically placed columns in the interior space to cool and warm the building . To test the efficiency of the chilled beam technology , the system was installed in the penthouse of the building and tested for a full year . The architect agreed to use the system after the test outperformed specifications . The installation represented the first large-scale use of the chilled beam technology in the United States . Other energy-saving enhancements included motion and daylight detectors to turn lights off when not needed , and special exterior windows which automatically dim to prevent daytime heating . The building 's ventilation system was also upgraded . The renovation left the structure with 1,400,000 square feet ( 130,000 m2 ) of interior space . The final cost of the renovation was pegged at $ 250 million . Some aesthetic improvements were made as well . The building now features a 1 acre ( 0.40 ha ) park in its open-to-the-sky central courtyard . Most of the courtyard 's concrete was removed and trees , shrubs , and flowers planted to absorb rainwater . The park , which is now no longer accessible by the public , also includes a very large granite abstract art sculpture ( \" Legacy \" ) by Richard Deutsch . The sculpture is meant to reflect the original facade of the building by Edward Durrell Stone as well as the memory of David Nassif , Sr. and his son , David Nassif , Jr .. The L 'Enfant Plaza Metro station still has an entrance under the building on D Street SW ( although this entrance closed between October 2007 and July 2008 for the building 's reconstruction ) . The renovation installed artwork by internationally-known artist Stephen Knapp near this entrance , in which strong beams of light are passed through dyed glass to splay brightly colored patterns on the ceiling . The light sculpture , titled \" Transformation \" , symbolizes the building 's renovation and rebirth . The Constitution Center is registered with the Green Building Council for Gold LEED Certification . The renovated Constitution Center won two awards . The Mid-Atlantic Construction construction news Web site gave the building its \" Project of the Year \u2013 Renovation / Restoration \" accolade in December 2010 . On March 25 , 2011 , the Washington Building Congress bestowed its 2011 WBC Craftsmanship Award on J.E. Richards , Inc. for excellence in workmanship in installing the power generation , distribution , and switchgear at Constitution Center . In January 2011 , Constitution Center was valued at $ 446 million by city tax assessors , making it the third most valuable private property in the city that year . = = Tenants = = The late-2000s recession left the renovated building struggling to find tenants . It was empty for nearly two years after it was opened for occupancy in April 2009 . Both the United States Department of Homeland Security and NASA explored leasing all or part of it in 2009 and 2010 , but chose not to do so . In August 2010 , the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) signed a letter contract for 900,000 square feet ( 84,000 m2 ) of space at Constitution Center . The SEC planned to take occupancy in September 2011 . In January 2011 , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency agreed to lease 640,000 square feet ( 59,000 m2 ) of space and the Federal Housing Finance Agency signed an agreement to occupy 335,000 square feet ( 31,100 m2 ) of space . The Office of the Comptroller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency both occupied the building by March 2012 . The SEC 's occupancy of the building did not occur as planned . In October 2010 , the SEC informed Nassif Associates that it needed only 340,000 square feet ( 32,000 m2 ) of the 900,000 square feet ( 84,000 m2 ) it had leased . On January 20 , 2011 , the SEC 's inspector general launched an investigation into whether the SEC leased was proper and legal . SEC chairman Mary Schapiro was strongly criticized by Republicans in the United States House of Representatives for her handling of the lease , which she had personally approved . By May , it was unclear if the SEC would occupy any space at all in the building . On May 23 , the SEC inspector general requested a formal opinion by the Comptroller General of the United States as to whether the lease violated the Antideficiency Act . The inspector general said SEC \" grossly overestimated the amount of space needed at SEC Headquarters for the SEC 's projected expansion by more than 300 percent and used these groundless and unsupportable figures to justify the SEC committing to an expenditure of $ 556.8 million over 10 years \" . In early July 2011 , Nassif Associates said it had agreed to release the SEC from occupying 550,000 square feet ( 51,000 m2 ) of space at Constitution Center . The company asked the SEC to reimburse it for $ 45 million in build-out and other expenses incurred between August 2010 and July 2011 , but the agency declined to do so . Nassif Associates said it declined to file suit against the agency , although it indicated it would continue to negotiate with the SEC and other federal agencies to seek reimbursement . At the same time , the United States Department of Justice said it was considering whether to prosecute officials at the SEC over the lease 's handling and the alleged forging of documents designed to justify it . Occupancy issues at Constitution Center were further confused by legislative action . In October 2011 , the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure voted 31-to-22 to permit the Federal Trade Commission to lease 160,000 square feet ( 15,000 m2 ) of space at Constitution Center and vacate the Apex Building ( which would be turned over to the National Gallery of Art ) . Although this legislation was not adopted by Congress , the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in March 2012 directed the General Services Administration ( GSA ) to analyze space needs for the Federal Trade Commission and several other federal agencies in the District of Columbia and issue a report to the committee on how Constitution Center could meet these needs . GSA reported in June 2012 that Constitution Center held too little space to house the entire FTC , and it was too costly to do so ( after accounting for moving expenses and rental prices ) . GSA instead proposed that the FTC lease additional space at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW and 1800 M Street NW ( where it already leased space , and where additional room was available ) . In April 2012 , Nassif Associates said the SEC owed it rent as well . The company said the letter contract required the agency to pay $ 1.3 million a month beginning November 1 , 2011 . As of April 30 , 2012 , the agency owed $ 7.75 million in back rent , a company spokesperson said . The agency disputed the cost , saying the build-out of the interior was never completed . SEC officials also said the agency now needed no space at all at Constitution Center , and that the SEC was working with GSA to find other federal tenants to take over its lease . In late May , the Federal Aviation Administration said it might lease 270,000 square feet ( 25,000 m2 ) of space in the building as part of a major consolidation of six of its offices in the city . In July 2012 , GSA bowed to congressional pressure and moved 1,100 FTC workers into Constitution Center from leased locations at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW and 1800 M Street NW . The deal kept the FTC in its Apex Building headquarters . Three months later , GSA rented out the last of its space in Constitution Center by signing leases for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities . = = 2012 sale = = On April 22 , 2011 , David Nassif Associates announced it was putting Constitution Center up for sale , and said it hoped to find a buyer by the end of summer 2011 . The company also said it hoped for a $ 900 million purchase price . Real estate banking firm Eastdil Secured assisted in securing a buyer . In June 2012 , the Washington Business Journal reported that CommonWealth Partners and Nassif Associates had negotiated a purchase agreement , but were unable to reach agreement . CommonWealth Partners then withdrew from any further discussions . A deal for the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012 . MetLife and an unidentified investor ( represented by Clarion Partners LLC ) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building . The sale price was $ 734 million , or $ 524 per square foot ( 0.093 square meters ) . The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building . ( It was the most paid per square foot , however . That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW , which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $ 905 per square foot . ) When the deal closed in February 2013 , David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations . City tax assessors said that Constitution Center 's value rose to $ 725.8 million in 2014 , up from $ 573.5 million in 2013 ( an increase of $ 152.3 million ) , making it the most valuable taxable property in the District of Columbia .",

                    "text": "Philadelphia transit strike of 1944 = The Philadelphia transit strike of 1944 was a sickout strike by white transit workers in Philadelphia that lasted from August 1 to August 6 , 1944 . The strike was triggered by the decision of the Philadelphia Transportation Company ( PTC ) , made under prolonged pressure from the federal government in view of significant labor shortages , to allow black employees of the PTC to hold non-menial jobs , such as motormen and conductors , that were previously reserved for white workers only . On August 1 , 1944 the eight black employees being trained as streetcar motormen were to make their first trial run ; that fact was used by the white PTC workers to start a massive sickout strike . The strike paralyzed the public transport system in Philadelphia for several days , bringing the city to a standstill and crippling its war production . Although the Transport Workers Union ( TWU ) was in favor of allowing promotions of black workers to any positions they were qualified for , and opposed the strike , the union was unable to persuade the white PTC employees to return to work . On August 3 , 1944 , under the provisions of the Smith \u2013 Connally Act , President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to take control of the Philadelphia Transportation Company , and Major-General Philip Hayes was put in charge of its operations . After several days of unsuccessful negotiations with the strike leaders , Hayes issued an order that the striking workers return to work on August 7 , 1944 , and that those refusing to comply be fired , stripped of their military draft deferment , and denied job availability certificates by the War Manpower Commission for the duration of the war . This ultimatum proved effective and on August 7 the strike ended and the strikers returned to work . The black workers , whose pending promotions to non-menial jobs triggered the strike , were allowed to assume those jobs . During the strike , despite considerable tensions , the city of Philadelphia remained mostly calm and there were no major outbreaks of violence . All of the city 's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was , by and large , opposed to the strike as well . Several of the strike leaders , including James McMenamin and Frank Carney , were arrested for violating the anti-strike act . The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike , and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself . The strike received considerable attention in the national media . The Philadelphia transit strike of 1944 is one of the most high profile instances of the federal government invoking the Smith \u2013 Connally Act . The Act had been passed in 1943 over President Roosevelt 's veto . = = Background = = = = = PTC and the union = = = Since even before the official entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941 , Philadelphia had been one on the major industrial war production centers in the U.S. By 1944 Philadelphia was regarded as the second largest war production center in the country . During that period the black population of the city grew substantially , and tensions with the predominantly white population began to increase . The Philadelphia Transportation Company ( PTC ) ran the city 's huge public transportation system , including subways , buses and trolleys ; by the time of the strike , it carried over one million people per day . By 1944 , the PTC 's eleven thousand strong workforce included 537 black employees . However , the PTC 's black workers had been restricted to holding menial jobs ; none were allowed to serve as conductors or motormen \u2013 positions that were reserved for white employees . As early as August 1941 , black employees started pressuring the PTC for fairer employment practices that would allow upgrading of black workers to the more prestigious jobs hitherto reserved for whites . Their efforts were rebuffed by PTC management , who claimed that the current union contract contained a clause prohibiting any significant change in employment practices and customs without the union 's approval ( although the contract said nothing about race ) . The leader of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union ( PRTEU ) , Frank Carney , proved to be equally reticent and claimed that he was not authorized by the union members to consider a request to allow promotions of black employees . = = = Federal involvement = = = The black PTC employees enlisted the help of the NAACP and started lobbying the federal authorities , particularly the Fair Employment Practices Commission ( FEPC ) , to intervene . The Fair Employment Practices Commission , created by an executive order of the President in 1941 , was charged with ensuring non-discrimination employment practices by government contractors . Initially it was a fairly weak agency , but its authority was significantly strengthened in 1943 by a new executive order that required all government contracts to have a non-discrimination clause . As the war progressed , the manpower shortages were getting more severe . In January 1943 the PTC requested 100 white motormen from the United States Employment Service ( USES ) , which was a part of the War Manpower Commission ( WMC ) . The WMC , aware that PTC had a pool of black employees seeking upgrading , asked the PTC to allow hiring of black employees for the vacant motormen positions . The PTC refused , again citing the \" customs clause \" of its union contract . After a complaint from the NAACP , the matter landed at the FEPC , headed at the time by Malcolm Ross . The FEPC made a series of unsuccessful attempts to convince the PTC management and the union leadership to change their stance and to allow promotions of black employees to non-menial jobs . The PTC eventually conceded that it would be willing to go along with the government 's request and \" employ Negroes , provided they are acceptable to fellow-workers \" , but the PRTEU leadership , particularly Frank Carney , staunchly resisted . On November 17 , 1943 , the FEPC issued a directive requiring that PTC end its discriminatory employment practices and allow blacks to hold non-menial jobs . The directive also required the PTC to review all job applications from June 1941 and redress earlier employment abuses based on racial discrimination . The union immediately protested and requested a public hearing , which took place on December 8 , 1943 . At the hearing the union tried to make the argument that hiring blacks who had applied for the non-menial positions since June 1941 but were denied would adversely affect the seniority rights of the presently employed white workers . Malcolm Ross rejected that argument , pointing out that the seniority rights only begin when an employee is actually hired for a particular job . On December 29 , 1943 , FEPC issued a second directive , reinforcing the first one . In an attempt to deflect the pressure , Carney and PRTEU contacted Virginia congressman Howard W. Smith , who at the time was the Chair of the House Committee to Investigate Executive Agencies . Smith , known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC , quickly scheduled a hearing . In the meantime , the union informed the PTC that it refused to comply with the FEPC order , and the PTC management told Ross that , given the union 's position , the PTC would not comply with the FEPC directive either . The hearing in front of Smith 's committee took place on January 11 , 1944 . The hearing was inconclusive , with Ross reiterating the FEPC position , and the union representatives falling back on the \" customs clause \" and their claims about seniority issues . Several white workers testifying at the hearing predicted that there would be trouble and unrest if promotions of black employees at the PTC were allowed : \" We are not going to accept them [ the blacks ] as fellow workers . ... We are not going to work with them . If anybody believe it , let them try it \" . A petition , signed by 1776 workers , presented at the hearing , read : \" Gentlemen : We , the white employees of the Philadelphia Transportation Co . , refuse to work with Negroes as motormen , conductors , operators and station trainmen \" . = = = Inter-union struggle = = = After the January 11 congressional hearing , Ross delayed enforcement of the FEPC directive to await the outcome of the upcoming union elections . The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11 , 1944 and a union election was called for March 14 , 1944 . Apart from PRTEU , which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees , there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers : the Transport Workers Union ( TWU ) , which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) affiliate , and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America , an American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) affiliate . The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter . The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections , but the topic was overshadowed by other issues , such as the details of a new contract with the PTC . After a bitter campaign , the TWU won the union elections , receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined . At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important , where the TWU was promising more attractive terms , and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility . Despite the TWU victory , animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated . The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on , and in the absence of a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives . = = = Immediate run up to the strike = = = In view of growing labor shortages , on July 1 , 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an important decision , ruling that from then on all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service ( USES ) . By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices . The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that would be open to all applicants , regardless of race . The company accepted eight black applicants ( three from the USES and five from its own ranks ) to train as streetcar coachmen . Their training was to take place in late July , and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1 . It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike . As the news spread , resentment among the white PTC workers began to grow . There were postings on PTC bulletin boards urging non-compliance with the new policy , and a petition was circulated calling for a strike to protest job upgrades of black employees . There were also several meetings called by agitators for the strike to discuss the plan of action . Frank Carney played an active role in these meetings . At the last such meeting , on July 31 , Carney announced that the \" D-Day \" for white workers had arrived . The TWU and the NAACP representatives warned the PTC about impending trouble , but the company management ignored those warnings , maintaining that there was nothing to fear . = = Events of the strike = = = = = Start of the strike = = = At 4 : 00 a.m. on August 1 , 1944 most trolleys , buses and subways in Philadelphia stopped running . Strike agitators blocked access to PTC depos with vehicles and advised the arriving workers of a sickout strike . By noon of August 1 the entire PTC transportation system was paralyzed . James McMenamin , a veteran PTC white motorman , organized a 150-member strike steering committee and became one of the main leaders of the strike . Frank Carney , the ousted union boss , was another key strike leader . At the end of the day the strikers held a large meeting , attended by more than 3,500 employees , outside the PTC carbarn on Luzerne Street . The racial rhetoric was escalating . At the meeting , Frank Carney declared that driving a streetcar was a white man 's job and said : \" put the Negroes back where they belong , back on the roadway \" . McMenamin declared that \" the strike was a strictly black and white issue \" . The PTC 's response to the strike was anemic and was interpreted by some contemporary observers and later historians as tacitly supporting the strike . Arthur Mitten , chairman of the company 's Industrial Relations Division , stopped by the Luzerne carbarn and asked the workers to return to work . Subsequently he suggested that WMC temporarily suspend the non-discrimination order , and even brought a pile of freshly printed fliers with a suspension announcement to the WMC offices . However , the WMC officials refused to approve suspension of the FEPC order and Mitten 's suspension fliers were not distributed . On the morning of August 1 , PTC officials immediately shut down the high-speed lines , even before the strike had spread , and instructed the company supervisors to stop selling tickets . The PTC left its carbarns open , which allowed the strikers to use the carbarns as rallying points and coordinating centers for their activities . The company also cancelled the regularly scheduled meeting of its executive committee , where the response to the strike could have been discussed , and refused to join the TWU in a radio broadcast urging the strikers to return to work . The TWU officials denounced the strike and pleaded with the PTC employees to resume work , but without success . The city 's mayor , Bernard Samuel , closed all alcohol-selling establishments in an effort to prevent drunken crowds . Governor Edward Martin followed suit and closed the state liquor stores in the area . The city deployed its full police force , with extra police officers posted at major intersections and other vital points . The NAACP , as well as other black civic groups , worked energetically to maintain calm among the black people of Philadelphia . They distributed more than 100,000 posters in black sections of the city , which read \" Keep Your Heads and Your Tempers ! ... Treat other people as you would be treated \" . The strike continued on August 2 . About 250 TWU members initiated a back-to-work movement but were quickly forced to back down by the strike 's leaders and supporters . At the end of the day , William H. Davis , head of the War Labor Board , wrote to President Roosevelt that the WLB had no jurisdiction over the situation and that it was up to the President to intervene . Representatives of the WMC and the FEPC had reached a similar conclusion about the need for the President 's intervention the day before . = = = Military takeover of the PTC = = = The Roosevelt administration felt that it needed to act quickly to stop the strike . War plants in Philadelphia reported debilitating absentee rates in their workforce due to the strike , which was causing significant damage to the city 's war production . The military reported delays in delivery of fighter planes , radar equipment , flamethrowers and numerous other items . Rear Admiral Milo Draemel complained that the strike so significantly slowed the war production in the area that \" it could delay the day of victory \" . The strike was also negatively affecting America 's image abroad , particularly in Europe , where the U.S. was fighting Nazi Germany under the slogans of freedom and racial justice . Germany , as well as Japan , were apt to use every instance of racial unrest in the U.S. for propaganda purposes . Official reaction by the White House was somewhat delayed by the President Roosevelt 's absence : at the time he was on a warship on his way from Hawaii to the Aleutian islands . At 7 : 45 p.m. on August 3 , in his twenty-fifth seizure order under the Smith \u2013 Connally Act , President Roosevelt authorized the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to take control of the Philadelphia Transportation Company . Major-General Philip Hayes , head of the Army 's Third Service Command , was put in charge of the PTC 's operations . Hayes acted quickly to take control of the situation . He posted the President 's order on the PTC carbarns and announced that the Army hoped to avoid using the troops and would try to rely on the local and state police to the extent possible . Hayes also announced that he had no intention of canceling or suspending the WMC hiring order . At 10 : 00 p.m. on August 3 , mistakenly believing that the government had agreed to the strikers ' demands , McMenamin declared the end of the strike . The mistake was quickly discovered , and over 1000 strikers voted in the early hours of August 4 to continue the strike . On August 4 limited transportation service resumed but largely dwindled as the day progressed . Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the Smith \u2013 Connally Act for disruption of the war production : the instigators could be subject to a fine of $ 5,000 , one year in prison , or both . This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by the strike organizers . On August 4 the strike committee again voted to continue the strike , but , in view of the possible Smith \u2013 Connally Act penalties , told the workers to make up their own minds and follow the committee if they chose . The maneuver worked and the strike continued . On Saturday , August 5 , with his patience exhausted , Hayes moved 5,000 army troops into the city . He announced that they would operate all idle PTC vehicles and ride as guards on active vehicles . He also made a plea to the strikers to support the war effort : \" We cannot kill any Germans or Japs with the troops who drive transit vehicles in Philadelphia \" . Later on August 5 , Hayes issued an ultimatum to the strikers , which was posted at all carbarns . The PTC workers were given a deadline of 12 : 01 a.m. on August 7 to resume their work . Those who refused would be fired and refused the WMC job availability certificates for the duration of the war ; those between the ages of 18 and 37 would also lose their military draft deferments . The Justice Department obtained federal warrants for McMenamin , Carney and two other strike leaders ; they were quickly arrested , and McMenamin finally told his followers to return to work on Monday , August 7 , as the government demanded . However , he expressed no regret for his actions before and during the strike . The strike was essentially over . On Sunday , August 6 , the PTC workers signed cards pledging to return to work on Monday . On Monday , August 7 , normal PTC operations resumed and the absentee rate was significantly lower than on a typical work day before the strike . As the strike ended , twenty-four strikers were dropped from the PTC rolls and six were immediately drafted into the military . = = = Actions of the local government = = = The enhanced police presence throughout the city during the strike helped to keep the calm , and the restrained approach of the police officers generally won praise from all sides , even though many of the policemen were seen as sympathetic to the striking white workers . The administration of Philadelphia 's Republican mayor Bernard Samuel was also seen as quietly sympathetic to the strikers . Throughout the strike , Mayor Samuel , who was also a member of the PTC board of directors , avoided any attempts of mediation . He refused to call a meeting of the PTC board of directors or to discuss the crisis with the TWU leaders . The mayor denied police protection to the two TWU officials who were willing to travel throughout the city and advocate an end to the strike . Samuel also refused to grant air time to War Production Board representatives who wanted to make a radio plea to end the strike . On August 2 , the mayor declined , without an explanation , the NAACP request for permission to send two sound-trucks into black neighborhoods to broadcast appeals for calm . The city 's black population felt disappointed and disenchanted with the actions of the local administration . = = = Public reaction = = = Except for a few incidents , the city of Philadelphia remained calm during the strike and , despite considerable fears of race riots , there were no major outbreaks of violence . At the start of the strike there were some incidents of vandalism and store window smashing , and the police arrested about 300 people , most of them blacks . In a nastier episode , three white motorists drove a car through a black neighborhood and , without stopping or warning , shot at a 13-year-old black boy , who received non-critical injuries . The most visible episode of unrest came when a black war factory worker , whose brother was in the Army , threw a paperweight at the Liberty Bell shouting \" Liberty Bell , oh Liberty Bell \u2014 liberty , that 's a lot of bunk ! \" He was arrested and sent by the magistrate for a psychiatric evaluation . However , by and large , calm prevailed and there were no major outbreaks of violence and no deaths or critical injuries among the public . The public opinion and the media in the city were overwhelmingly against the strikers . All the city 's newspapers ran editorials denouncing the strike , which was perceived as unpatriotic and harmful to the war effort ; a number of editorials also decried the racial nature of the strike . Most of the letters to the editor condemned the strike . The radio stations in the city denounced the strike as well , as did the national press . The New York Times wrote : \" It would be hard to find in the whole history of American labor a strike in which so much damage has been done for so base a purpose \" . The Wall Street Journal editorial condemned the strike but stated that the powers exercised by the government in ending the strike were only justified by the war time conditions . The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune , while denouncing the strike , tried to put the blame for causing it on the CIO-affiliated Transport Workers Union , and accused the Roosevelt administration of acting too slowly because of its support for the CIO . While critical of the strike , the public did not necessarily support the cause of equal employment opportunities for black workers . A public opinion poll conducted in Philadelphia during the strike showed that only a slim majority of the city 's population felt that blacks should be hired as motormen and conductors , but that a significant majority opposed having a strike over this issue . The strikers directed much of their anger at the federal government , which they accused of overreaching and of refusing to listen to legitimate complaints by white workers . This view resonated with many white Philadelphians and with conservative politicians nationally . On August 8 , Senator Richard Russell from Georgia , one of the leaders of the conservative coalition in Congress , gave a seventy-minute speech on the Senate floor , blaming the FEPC for causing the strike . Russell finished his speech by calling the FEPC \" the most dangerous force in existence in the United States today \" . Some of the newspapers in the South also blamed the incident on the Roosevelt administration and even on First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt , with Savannah News claiming that the episode was caused by \" Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt 's persistent efforts to force social equality on the American people \" . = = Aftermath = = Starting with August 7 , the PTC resumed its normal schedule and there were no further disruptions . The troops remained in Philadelphia for another week and a half and rode as guards on PTC vehicles , but encountered no further problems . Seven of the eight black trainees resumed their training ( one withdrew voluntarily because his duties as Jehovah 's Witness minister conflicted with the PTC work schedule ) . On August 9 , the PTC finally agreed to a favorable contact which had been approved by the TWU in June . On August 17 , Hayes returned full control of the public transportation network to the PTC . Subsequent integration of black employees into the PTC workforce proceeded with no further trouble . By December 1944 the PTC had 18 black streetcar operators . An attractive new union contract helped quell the remaining discontent among the white PTC workers . Within a year , the company had over 900 black employees working in a variety of positions , including as drivers and conductors . The NAACP later blamed the PTC management for intentionally dragging its feet on the contract that the TWU approved in late June . The NAACP claimed that the PTC management had hoped to undermine the TWU 's position with the workers and to possibly oust TWU in favor of the more pliable PRTEU . The PTC was aware that the Smith \u2013 Connally Act forbade strikes harming war production and that if , with a contract impasse , TWU itself had initiated a contract strike , the union might have been tossed out . This analysis of the situation was shared later by several historians , particularly by James Wolfinger . Another historian , Alan M. Winkler , also had a largely negative view of the company 's role in the conflict and concluded that PTC management , while not overtly conspiring with the strikers , reacted feebly to the strike and tried to opportunistically exploit the situation and the racist attitudes of many white workers for their own purposes . The leaders of the strike , including McMenamin and Carney , were charged in federal court under the Smith \u2013 Connally Act ; some thirty strikers were also indicted later . The federal grand jury was convened on August 9 and heard testimony for two months . However , the grand jury returned inconclusive findings ; their report stated that most of the striking workers knew nothing about the strike at the start , and blamed a few instigators for escalating the situation , but did not detail the instigators ' activities . The report was also critical of the PTC 's response to the strike , characterizing it as inadequate and ineffective . The government dropped its charges against the defendants on March 12 , 1945 , with most of them pleading nolo contendere and receiving a fine of $ 100 each . As labor historian James Wolfinger observed , the strike \" demonstrated the profound racial cleavages , that divided the working class , not just in the South but across the nation \" . Although brief , the Philadelphia transit strike of 1944 had significant negative impact on the war effort , resulting in a loss of four million work hours in war plants alone . The War Manpower Commission estimated that the Philadelphia strike cost the nation 's war production the equivalent of 267 Flying Fortresses or five destroyers . Malcolm Ross later characterized the strike as \" the most expensive racial dispute of World War II \" . The strike also exposed the limitations of the FEPC 's power . The FEPC did not possess the final authority to enforce its decisions and only the executive intervention of the President made the resolution of the dispute possible . Nevertheless , the strike demonstrated that a combination of black activism , particularly by the NAACP , together with resolute federal policies , were able to break long standing racial barriers in employment .",

It is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere , and the sixth-tallest in the world . The supertall structure has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center , which was completely destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . The new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre ( 6.5 ha ) World Trade Center site , on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center . The building is bounded by West Street to the west , Vesey Street to the north , Fulton Street to the south , and Washington Street to the east . The building 's architect was David Childs , whose firm Skidmore , Owings & Merrill ( SOM ) also designed the Burj Khalifa and the Willis Tower . The construction of below-ground utility relocations , footings , and foundations for the new building began on April 27 , 2006 . One World Trade Center became the tallest structure in New York City on April 30 , 2012 , when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building . The tower 's steel structure was topped out on August 30 , 2012 . On May 10 , 2013 , the final component of the skyscraper 's spire was installed , making the building , including its spire , reach a total height of 1,776 feet ( 541 m ) . Its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed . The building opened on November 3 , 2014 . On March 30 , 2009 , the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ( PANYNJ ) confirmed that the building would be officially known by its legal name of \" One World Trade Center \" , rather than its colloquial name of \" Freedom Tower \" . The building is 104 standard floors high , but the tower has only 94 actual stories . The new World Trade Center complex will eventually include five high-rise office buildings built along Greenwich Street , as well as the National September 11 Memorial & Museum , located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood . The construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex . = = Original building ( 1970 \u2013 2001 ) = = = = = Construction = = = The construction of the World Trade Center , of which the Twin Towers ( One and Two World Trade Center ) were the centerpieces , was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller . The project was intended to help revitalize Lower Manhattan . The project was planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki . Yamasaki came up with the idea of building twin towers . After extensive negotiations , the New Jersey and New York State governments , which supervise the Port Authority , consented to the construction of the World Trade Center at the Radio Row site , located in the lower-west area of Manhattan . To satisfy the New Jersey government , the Port Authority agreed to buy the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad ( renamed to Port Authority Trans-Hudson ) , which transported commuters from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan . The towers were designed as framed tube structures , giving tenants open floor plans , unobstructed by columns or walls . This design was accomplished by using many closely spaced perimeter columns , providing much of structure 's strength , with the gravity load shared with the core columns . The elevator system , which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators , allowed substantial floor space to be used for office purposes by making the structural core smaller . The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques , such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation . Construction of the North Tower ( One World Trade Center ) began in August 1966 ; extensive use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process . The first tenants moved into the North Tower in December 1970 . In the 1970s , four other low-level buildings were built as part of the World Trade Center complex . A seventh building was built in the mid-1980s . = = = Specifications and operations = = = After Seven World Trade Center was built in the 1980s , the World Trade Center complex had a total of seven buildings ; however , the most notable ones were the main Twin Towers built in the 1970s \u2014 One World Trade Center was the North Tower , and Two World Trade Center was the South Tower . Each tower was over 1,350 feet ( 410 m ) high , and occupied about 1 acre ( 0.40 ha ) of the total 16 acres ( 6.5 ha ) of the site 's land . During a press conference in 1973 , Yamasaki was asked , \" Why two 110-story buildings ? Why not one 220-story building ? \" His response was , \" I didn 't want to lose the human scale . \" When completed in 1972 , One World Trade Center became the tallest building in the world for two years , surpassing the Empire State Building , which had held the record for 40 years . The North Tower was 1,368 feet ( 417 m ) tall , and in 1978 , a telecommunications antenna was added to the top of the roof ; by itself , the antenna was 360 feet ( 110 m ) tall . With the 360-foot ( 110 m ) -tall antenna , the highest point of the North Tower reached 1,728 ft ( 527 m ) . The tower held its record for a brief period of time ; Chicago 's Sears Tower , finished in May 1973 , was 1,450 feet ( 440 m ) at the rooftop . At 110 floors , the World Trade Center towers had more floors than any other building at that time . This number was not surpassed until the construction of the Burj Khalifa ( 163 floors ) , which opened in 2010 . Of the 110 stories , eight were set aside as mechanical floors ( floors 7 / 8 , 41 / 42 , 75 / 76 , and 108 / 109 ) , which were four two-floor areas that were spaced up the building in even intervals . All the remaining floors were open for tenants . Each floor of the tower had 40,000 square feet ( 3,700 m2 ) of available space . The North and South tower had 3,800,000 square feet ( 350,000 m2 ) of total office space . The entire complex of seven buildings had a combined total of 13,400,000 square feet ( 1,240,000 m2 ) of office space . The complex initially failed to attract the expected clientele . During the early years , various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World Trade Center , such as the State of New York . In the 1980s , the city 's perilous financial condition eased , after which an increasing number of private companies \u2014 mostly financial firms related to Wall Street \u2014 became tenants . During the 1990s , approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex , including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley , Aon Corporation , and Salomon Brothers . The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center , and a PATH station . The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald , and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The tower 's electrical service was supplied by Consolidated Edison ( ConEd ) at 13,800 volts . The electricity passed through the World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center ( PDC ) , and was then sent up the building 's core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors . The substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480 / 277 volts , and the voltage was then further lowered to 208 / 120 volts for general power and lighting services . The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of Five World Trade Center . The 110th floor of One World Trade Center ( the North Tower ) housed radio and television transmission equipment . The roof of the North Tower contained a vast array of transmission antennas , including the 360 feet ( 110 m ) center antenna mast , rebuilt by Dielectric Inc. to support DTV in 1999 . The center mast contained the television signals for almost all NYC television broadcasters : WCBS-TV 2 , WNBC-TV 4 , WNYW 5 , WABC-TV 7 , WWOR-TV 9 Secaucus , WPIX 11 , WNET 13 Newark , WPXN-TV 31 and WNJU 47 Linden . It also had four NYC FM broadcasters : WPAT-FM 93.1 , WNYC 93.9 , WKCR 89.9 , and WKTU 103.5 . Access to the roof was controlled by the WTC Operations Control Center ( OCC ) , located in the B1 level of the South Tower . After the September 11 attacks of 2001 , the broadcasting equipment for the radio and television stations was moved to the Empire State Building . On a typical weekday , a combined total of 50,000 people worked in the North and South Towers , with another 200,000 passing through as visitors . The complex was so large that it had its own zip code : 10048 . The Windows on the World restaurant , located on top of the North Tower , reported revenues of $ 37 million in 2000 , making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States . The Twin Towers became known worldwide , appearing in movies , television shows , postcards , and other merchandise . The towers came to be seen as a New York City icon , much like the Empire State Building , the Chrysler Building , and the Statue of Liberty . = = = Incidents = = = On February 13 , 1975 , a three-alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the North Tower . Fire spread through the core of the building to the 9th and 14th floors , as the insulation for telephone cables , located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors , had been ignited . Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately , and the original fire was put out in a few hours . Most of the damage was on the 11th floor , where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper , alcohol-based fluid for office machines , and other office equipment . Fireproofing protected the steel , and there was no structural damage to the tower . In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors , water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below . At the time , the World Trade Center complex had no fire sprinkler systems . The first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center occurred on February 26 , 1993 , at 12 : 17 p.m. , when a Ryder truck filled with 1,500 pounds ( 680 kg ) of explosives , planted by Ramzi Yousef , detonated in the underground garage of the North Tower . The blast resulted in a 100 feet ( 30 m ) hole through five sublevels . The greatest damage was on levels B1 and B2 , with significant structural damage on level B3 . Six people were killed , and more than a thousand were injured , as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time . Many people inside the North Tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no emergency lighting , and some took two hours or more to reach safety . = = = September 11 attacks = = = At 8 : 46 a.m. ( EDT ) on September 11 , 2001 , five hijackers affiliated with al-Qaeda crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower . Seventeen minutes later , at 9 : 03 a.m. ( EDT ) , a second group of terrorists crashed the hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower , striking between the 77th and 85th floors . By 9 : 59 a.m. ( EDT ) , the South Tower collapsed after burning for approximately 56 minutes . After burning for 102 minutes , the North Tower collapsed due to structural failure at 10 : 28 a.m. ( EDT ) When the North Tower collapsed , debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center , damaging it and starting fires . The fires burned for hours , compromising the building 's structural integrity . Seven World Trade Center collapsed at 5 : 21 p.m. ( EDT ) Together with a simultaneous attack on the Pentagon in Arlington , Virginia , and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people ( 2,507 civilians , 343 firefighters , 72 law enforcement officers , 55 military personnel , and the 19 hijackers ) . More than 90 % of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact . In the North Tower , 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped , and died of smoke inhalation , fell , jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames , or were killed when the building eventually collapsed . One stairwell in the South Tower , Stairwell A , somehow avoided complete destruction , unlike the rest of the building . When Flight 11 hit , all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed , thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape . 107 people below the point of impact also died . = = Current building = = = = = Planning and early development = = = Following the destruction of the original World Trade Center , there was debate regarding the future of the World Trade Center site . There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately , and by 2002 , the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site . The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex . When the public rejected the first round of designs , a second , more open competition took place in December 2002 , in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner . This design went through many revisions , mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein , who held the lease to the World Trade Center site at that time . There was criticism concerning the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan . Only 82 floors would have been habitable , and the total office space of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex would have been reduced by more than 3,000,000 square feet ( 280,000 m2 ) in comparison with the original complex . The floor limit was imposed by Silverstein , who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident . Much of the building 's height would have consisted of a large , open-air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower , containing wind turbines and \" sky gardens \" . In a subsequent design , the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original World Trade Center , and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans . In 2002 , former New York Governor George Pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect 's design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor , Ron Lauder . A final design for the \" Freedom Tower \" was formally unveiled on June 28 , 2005 . To address security issues raised by the New York City Police Department , a 187-foot ( 57 m ) concrete base was added to the design in April of that year . The design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a \" concrete bunker \" . However , the prisms were later found to be unworkable , as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards . As a result , it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast-resistant glass . Contrasting with Libeskind 's original plan , the tower 's final design tapers octagonally as it rises . Its designers stated that the tower would be a \" monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna . \" In 2006 , Larry Silverstein commented on a planned completion date : \" By 2012 we should have a completely rebuilt World Trade Center , more magnificent , more spectacular than it ever was . \" On April 26 , 2006 , the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin . A formal agreement was drafted the following day , the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the Empire State Building . Construction began in May ; a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived . = = = Construction and later development = = = The symbolic cornerstone of One World Trade Center was laid in a ceremony on July 4 , 2004 . The stone had an inscription supposedly written by Arthur J. Finkelstein . However , construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money , security , and design . The last major issues were resolved on April 26 , 2006 , when a deal was made between developer Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on June 23 , 2006 . Soon after , explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the building 's foundation , onto which 400 cubic yards ( 310 cubic meters ) of concrete was poured by November 2007 . In a December 18 , 2006 , ceremony held in nearby Battery Park City , members of the public were invited to sign the first 30-foot ( 9.1 m ) steel beam installed onto the building 's base . It was welded onto the building 's base on December 19 , 2006 . Foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward , so the tower 's footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year . In January 2008 , two cranes were moved onto the site . Construction of the tower 's concrete core , which began after the cranes arrived , reached street level by May 17 . However , construction of the base was not finished until two years later , after which construction of the office floors began , and the first glass windows were subsequently installed ; during 2010 , floors were constructed at a rate of about one per week . An advanced \" cocoon \" scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling , and was the first such safety system installed on a steel structure in the city . The tower reached 52 floors and was over 600 feet ( 180 m ) tall by December 2010 . The tower 's steel frame was halfway complete by then , but grew to 82 floors by the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks , at which time its concrete flooring had reached 72 floors and the glass cladding had reached 56 floors . In 2009 , the Port Authority changed the official name of the building from \" Freedom Tower \" to \" One World Trade Center \" , stating that this name was the \" easiest for people to identify with . \" The change came after board members of the Port Authority voted to sign a 21-year lease deal with Vantone Industrial Co . , a Chinese real estate company , which will become the building 's first commercial tenant . Vantone plans to create the China Center , a trade and cultural facility , covering 191,000 square feet on floors 64 through 69 . Detailed floor plans of the tower were posted on the New York City 's Department of Finance website in May 2011 , resulting in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area , who warned that the plans could potentially be used for a future terrorist attack . While under construction , the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions . On the weekend of July 4 , 2011 , it was lit up with the colors of the American flag to commemorate Independence Day , and it was lit up with the same colors on September 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks . On October 27 of that same year , it was illuminated with pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month . On December 11 , the Port Authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season . On February 24 , 2012 , the building was lit up with red in honor of Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan , who became a cardinal on February 18 . On June 14 , 2012 , it was illuminated with red , white , and blue to honor Flag Day . In August , it was illuminated with red in honor of the Armed Forces . On September 8 , 2012 , it was once again illuminated with red , white , and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks . On June 24 , 2013 , the building was again illuminated with red , white , and blue to celebrate the Fourth of July . On November 12 , 2013 , three hundred red , white , and blue lights were lit up . The tower 's loading dock , however , was not due to be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building , so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars . The temporary PATH station was not to be removed until its official replacement , the World Trade Center Transportation Hub , was completed , blocking access to the planned loading area . By March 2012 , One World Trade Center 's steel structure had reached 93 floors , growing to 94 floors and 1,240 feet ( 380 m ) by the end of the month . However , because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements , the 94th floor was numbered \" floor 100 \" , because the extra space was occupied by the high-ceilinged 91st floor , which was used for mechanical purposes . The still-incomplete tower became New York City 's tallest building by roof height in April 2012 , passing the 1,250-foot ( 380 m ) roof height of the Empire State Building . President Barack Obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote , on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower , the sentence \" We remember , we rebuild , we come back stronger ! \" That same month , with the tower 's structure nearing completion , the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building , seeking to attract visitors and tenants . One World Trade Center 's steel structure topped out at the nominal 104th floor , with a total height of 1,368 feet ( 417 m ) , in August 2012 . The tower 's antenna was shipped to New York in November 2012 ; the first section of the antenna was hoisted to the top of the tower on December 12 , 2012 , and was installed on January 15 , 2013 . By March 2013 , two sections of the antenna had been installed . The spire 's completion was scheduled for April 29 , 2013 , but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces . On May 10 , 2013 , the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center , bringing the tower to its full height of 1,776 feet ( 541 m ) , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world , as well as the tallest in the city , surpassing the 1,454-foot ( 443 m ) Empire State Building . In subsequent months , the exterior elevator shaft was removed ; the podium glass , interior decorations , and other finishings were being installed ; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed . A report in September 2013 revealed that , at the time of the report , the World Trade Center Association ( WTCA ) was negotiating with regard to the \" World Trade Center \" name , as the WTCA had purchased the rights to the name in 1986 . The WTCA sought $ 500,000 worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of \" World Trade Center \" in the tower 's name and associated souvenirs . On November 12 , 2013 , the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ( CTBUH ) made the controversial announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest building in the United States at 1,776 feet , declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building 's architecture . By the same reasoning , the building was also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere . = = = Opening and post-opening = = = On November 1 , 2014 , moving trucks started moving items for the tower 's first tenant , magazine publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast , from its old headquarters in Times Square to One World Trade Center . The New York Times noted that the area around the World Trade Center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms , residences , and luxury shops , coincident with the building of the new tower . The building opened on November 3 , 2014 , and Cond\u00e9 Nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors . Cond\u00e9 Nast occupies floors 20 to 44 , having completed its move in early 2015 . It is expected that the company will attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40 % of unleased space in the tower , as Cond\u00e9 Nast had revitalized Times Square after moving there in 1999 . Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day . Future tenants will include Kids Creative , Legends Hospitality , the BMB Group , Servcorp , and GQ . On November 12 , 2014 , the supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked . The cables were manufactured by Tractel , and they were used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the building 's exterior . At the time , the platform was holding a two-man , SEIU-affiliated window washing team . The slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower . The workers were rescued by over 100 FDNY firefighters , who used a diamond saw to cut through the glass . After the incident , the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia , and were taken to the hospital . = = = Estimated cost and funding = = = An estimate in February 2007 placed the initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $ 3 billion , or $ 1,150 per square foot ( $ 12,380 per square meter ) . However , the tower 's total estimated construction cost had risen to $ 3.9 billion by April 2012 , making it the most expensive building in the world at the time . The tower 's construction was partly funded by approximately $ 1 billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks . The State of New York provided an additional $ 250 million , and the Port Authority agreed to give $ 1 billion , which would be obtained through the sale of bonds . The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds , with a 56 percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015 ; however , the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower 's construction . = = = Architecture and design = = = Many of Daniel Libeskind 's original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower 's final design . One World Trade Center 's final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile , intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline . The tower 's central spire draws from previous buildings , such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building . It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers , rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty . The building occupies a 200-foot ( 61 m ) square , with an area of 40,000 square feet ( 3,700 m2 ) , nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers . The tower is built upon a 185-foot ( 56 m ) tall windowless concrete base , designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks . Originally , the base was to be covered in decorative prismatic glass , but a simpler glass-and-steel fa\u00e7ade was adopted when the prisms proved unworkable . The current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels , similar to those on 7 World Trade Center . LED lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night . Cable-net glass fa\u00e7ades on all four sides of the building for the higher floors , designed by Schlaich Bergermann , will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex . The fa\u00e7ades are 60 feet ( 18 m ) high , and range in width from 30 feet ( 9.1 m ) on the east and west sides , 50 feet ( 15 m ) on the north side , and 70 feet ( 21 m ) on the south side . The curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by Benson Industries in Portland , Oregon , using glass made in Minnesota by Viracon . From the 20th floor upwards , the square edges of the tower 's cubic base are chamfered back , shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles , or an elongated square antiprism . Near its middle , the tower forms a perfect octagon , and then culminates in a glass parapet , whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base . A 408-foot ( 124 m ) sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna \u2013 designed in a collaboration between Skidmore , Owings and Merrill ( SOM ) , artist Kenneth Snelson ( who invented the tensegrity structure ) , lighting designers , and engineers \u2013 is secured by a system of cables , and rises from a circular support ring , which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment . At night , an intense beam of light is projected horizontally from the spire and shines over 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) above the tower . David Childs of SOM , the architect of One World Trade Center , said the following regarding the tower 's design : We really wanted our design to be grounded in something that was very real , not just in sculptural sketches . We explored the infrastructural challenges because the proper solution would have to be compelling , not just beautiful . The design does have great sculptural implications , and we fully understand the iconic importance of the tower , but it also has to be a highly efficient building . The discourse about Freedom Tower has often been limited to the symbolic , formal and aesthetic aspects but we recognize that if this building doesn 't function well , if people don 't want to work and visit there , then we will have failed as architects . = = = = Layout = = = = Just south of the new One World Trade Center is the National September 11 Memorial & Museum , which is located where the original Twin Towers stood . Immediately to the east is World Trade Center Transportation Hub and the new Two World Trade Center site . To the north is Seven World Trade Center , and to the west is Brookfield Place . One World Trade Center 's top floor is officially designated as floor 104 , despite the fact that the tower only contains 94 actual stories . The building has 86 usable above-ground floors , of which 78 are intended for office purposes ( approximately 2,600,000 square feet ( 240,000 m2 ) ) . The base consists of floors 1 \u2013 19 , including a 65-foot-high ( 20 m ) public lobby . The office floors begin at floor 20 , and go up to floor 63 . There is a sky lobby on floor 64 ; office floors resume on floor 65 , and stop at floor 90 . Floors 91 \u2013 99 and 103 \u2013 104 are mechanical floors . The tower has a three-story observation deck , located on floors 100 \u2013 102 , in addition to existing broadcast and antenna facilities . Similar to in the Empire State Building , visitors will be separated from the tenants , having their own separate entrance next to the museum , descending down to a below-ground security screening area . On the observation deck , the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor , but there will be a food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor . To show visitors the city , and give them information and stories about New York , an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors . The admission fee will be $ 32 per person , but admission discounts are available for children and seniors , and the deck will be free for 9 / 11 responders and families of 9 / 11 victims . When it opens , the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year . Tickets went on sale starting on April 8 . However , the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck . It officially opened on May 28 , 2015 , one day ahead of schedule . There are three eating venues at the top of the building : a caf\u00e9 ( called One Caf\u00e9 ) , a bar and \" small plates \" grill ( One Mix ) , and a fine dining restaurant ( One Dining ) . Some have criticized the food prices ; the need of a full observatory ticket purchase to enter ; and their reputations compared to Windows on the World , the top-floor restaurant in the original One World Trade Center . The tenants have access to below-ground parking , storage , and shopping ; access to PATH , New York City Subway trains , and the World Financial Center is also provided at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub , Fulton Street / Fulton Center , Chambers Street , and Cortlandt Street stations . The building allows direct access to West Street , Vesey Street , and Fulton Street at ground level . The building has an approximate underground footprint of 42,000 square feet ( 3,900 m2 ) , of which 55,000 square feet ( 5,100 m2 ) is retail space . A plan to build a restaurant near the top of the tower , similar to the original One World Trade Center 's Windows on the World , was abandoned as logistically impractical . The tower 's window-washing tracks are located on a 16-square-foot area , which will be designated as floor 110 as a symbolic reference to the 110 floors of the original tower . = = = = = Design evolution = = = = = The original design went through significant changes after the Durst Organization joined the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as the co-developer of the project in 2010 . The 185-foot ( 56 m ) tall base corners were originally designed to gently slope upward , and have prismatic glass . The corners were later squared . In addition , the base 's walls are now covered in \" hundreds of pairs of 13-foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight-inch-wide stainless-steel slats . \" The spire was originally to be enclosed with a protective radome , described as a \" sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels \" . However , the radome-enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna . Douglas Durst , the chairman of the Durst Organization , stated that the design change would save $ 20 million . However , the tower 's architect , Skidmore Owings & Merrill , strongly criticized the change . David Childs , the lead designer , said , \" Eliminating this integral part of the building 's design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate ... We stand ready to work with the Port on an alternate design . \" After joining the project in 2010 , the Durst Organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs , but the proposal was rejected by the Port Authority 's then-executive director , Christopher O. Ward . Ward was replaced by Patrick Foye in September 2011 . Foye changed the Port Authority 's position , and the radome was removed from the plans . In 2012 , Douglas Durst gave a statement regarding the final decision : \" ( the antenna ) is going to be mounted on the building over the summer . There 's no way to do anything at this point . \" The large triangular plaza on the west side of One World Trade Center , facing the Hudson River , was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street . However , the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design . The terrace can be accessed through a staircase on Vesey Street . The terrace is paved in granite , and has 12 sweetgum trees , in addition to a block-long planter / bench . Durst also removed a skylight from the plaza 's plans ; the skylight was designed to allow natural light to enter the below-ground observation deck lobby . The plaza is 5 ft 8 in ( 1.73 m ) higher than the adjacent sidewalk . The Port Authority formally approved all these revisions , and the revisions were first reported by the New York Post . Patrick Foye , the executive director of the Port Authority , said that he thought that the changes were \" few and minor \" in a telephone interview . A contract negotiated between the Port Authority and the Durst Organization states that the Durst Organization will receive a $ 15 million fee and a percentage of \" base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project . \" The specifics of the signed contract give Durst 75 percent of the savings , up to $ 24 million , with further returns going down to 50 percent , 25 percent and 15 percent as the savings increase . = = = = = Height = = = = = The top floor of One World Trade Center is 1,368 feet ( 417 m ) above ground level , along with a 33 ft 4 in ( 10.16 m ) parapet ; this is identical to the roof height of the original One World Trade Center . The tower 's antenna / spire brings it to a pinnacle height of 1,776 feet ( 541 m ) , a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776 , when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed . If the antenna is included in the building 's height , as stated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ( CTBUH ) , One World Trade Center surpasses the height of Taipei 101 ( 1,671-foot ( 509 m ) ) , is the world 's tallest all-office building , and the fourth-tallest skyscraper in the world , behind the Burj Khalifa , Abraj Al Bait , and Shanghai Tower . One World Trade Center is the second-tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere , as the CN Tower in Toronto exceeds One World Trade Center 's pinnacle height by approximately 12 m ( 39.4 ft ) . The Chicago Spire , with a planned height of 2,000 feet ( 610 m ) , was expected to exceed the height of One World Trade Center , but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in 2009 . After design changes for One World Trade Center 's spire were revealed in May 2012 , there were questions as to whether the 408-foot ( 124 m ) -tall structure would still qualify as a spire , and thus be included in the building 's height . Since the tower 's spire is not enclosed in a radome as originally planned , it could be classified as a simple antenna , which is not included in a building 's height , according to the CTBUH . Without the antenna , One World Trade Center would be 1,368 feet ( 417 m ) tall , making it the fourth-tallest building in the United States , behind the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel & Tower , both located in Chicago , and 432 Park Avenue in New York . The building is currently the tallest in New York City with the antenna ; however , without the antenna , it was surpassed in 2015 by 432 Park Avenue , which topped out at 1,396 feet ( 426 m ) high . One World Trade Center 's developers have disputed the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign , with Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman reiterating that \" One World Trade Center will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere . \" In 2012 , the CTBUH announced that it would wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire would count towards the building 's height . On November 12 , 2013 , the CTBUH announced that One World Trade Center 's spire would count as part of the building 's recognized height , giving it a final height of 1,776 feet , and making it the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere . = = = = Sustainability = = = = Like other buildings in the new World Trade Center complex , One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features . Much of the building 's structure and interior is built from recycled materials , including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles ; around 80 percent of the tower 's waste products are recycled . Although the roof area of any tower is limited , the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems . The building 's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8 megawatts ( MW ) of power , and its waste steam generates electricity . The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower 's fuel cell system , which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed . The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power . The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass , which allows maximum sunlight to pass through ; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days , reducing energy costs . Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site , One World Trade Center is heated by steam , with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site . One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) Gold Certification , making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world . = = = = Safety and security = = = = = = = = = Security features = = = = = Along with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base , a number of other safety features were included in the building 's design , so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack . Like 7 World Trade Center , the building has 3-foot ( 91 cm ) thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells , elevator shafts , risers , and sprinkler systems . There are also extra-wide , pressurized stairwells , along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters , and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system . In comparison , the original Twin Towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions , protected only by lightweight drywall panels . The building is no longer 25 feet ( 8 m ) away from West Street , as the Twin Towers were ; at its closest point , West Street is 65 feet ( 20 m ) away . The windows facing West Street are equipped with specially tempered blast-resistant plastic , which looks almost like the glass used in the other sides of the building . The Port Authority has stated : \" Its structure is designed around a strong , redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected by a combination of welding and bolting . Paired with a concrete-core shear wall , the moment frame lends substantial rigidity and redundancy to the overall building structure while providing column-free interior spans for maximum flexibility . \" In addition to optimal safety design , new security measures will be implemented . All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before they enter the site through the underground road . Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed in and around the site , with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD . A computer system will use video-analytic computer software , designed to detect potential threats , such as unattended bags , and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects . New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site . Once the World Trade Center site is fully completed , the plaza will be completely opened to the public , as the original World Trade Center plaza was . The initial stage of the opening process began on Thursday , May 15 , 2014 , when the \" Interim Operating Period \" of the National September 11 Memorial ended . During this period , all visitors were required to undergo airport style security screening , as part of the \" Interim Operating Period \" , which was expected to end on December 31 , 2013 . However , screening did not fully end until the official dedication and opening of the museum on May 21 , 2014 , after which visitors were allowed to use the plaza without needing passes . = = = = = Incidents = = = = = In March 2014 , the tower was scaled by 16-year-old New Jersey resident Justin Casquejo , who entered the site through a hole in a fence . He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges . He allegedly dressed like a construction worker , sneaked in , and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower \u2019 s 88th floor , according to news sources . He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor , walked past a sleeping security guard , and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna , where he took pictures for two hours . The elevator operator was reassigned , and the guard was fired . It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower , which facilitated Casquejo 's entry to the site . Less than a week after the trespassing incident , four people \u2014 three male parachutists ( one of whom was a construction worker at the site ) and their lookout \u2014 were arrested for a BASE jump they conducted on September 30 , 2013 . They had posted a video of the jump online . As a result of these incidents , the Durst Organization 's head of security at One World Trade Center , David Velazquez , resigned on March 28 , 2014 . = = = = Controversies = = = = The social center of the previous One World Trade Center included a restaurant on the 107th floor , called Windows on the World , and The Greatest Bar on Earth ; these were tourist attractions in their own right , and a gathering spot for people who worked in the towers . This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States , called \" Windows on the World Wine School \" , run by wine personality Kevin Zraly . Despite numerous assurances that these attractions would be rebuilt , the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild them , which has outraged some observers . The fortified base of the tower has also been a source of controversy . Some critics , including Deroy Murdock of the National Review , have said that it is alienating and dull , and reflects a sense of fear rather than freedom , leading them to dub the building \" the Fear Tower \" . Nicolai Ouroussoff , the architecture critic for The New York Times , calls the tower base a \" grotesque attempt to disguise its underlying paranoia \" . = = = = Statue in front of the building = = = = The America 's Response Monument , a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue commemorating the actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces in the first few weeks of the War in Afghanistan , was unveiled to the public during the Veteran 's Day Parade in New York City on November 11 , 2011 . The statue was displayed on a float , which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street . It was dedicated that same day , in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland , commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan . It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero . It is the first public monument to honor United States special forces ; there is also a monument commemorating the Green Berets on Meadows Memorial Field in Fort Bragg , North Carolina . On October 19 , 2012 , the monument was rededicated in front of the tower . The inscription at base of the sculpture bears its name , \" America 's Response Monument \" , and the Latin subtitle De Oppresso Liber . The subtitle , traditionally translated as \" to free the oppressed \" , is the motto of the Green Berets , who inspired the monument . A piece of steel from the original World Trade Center is embedded in the base . The statue was dedicated by Lieutenant General John Mulholland , Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command . Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the dedication ceremony . The land on which the monument stands was donated by a private Wall Street firm . The statue cost over $ 750,000 to make , but all the needed money was donated by hundreds of private citizens , including some survivors of the September 11 attacks . = = = Owners and tenants = = = One World Trade Center is principally owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . Around 5 percent equity of the building was sold to the Durst Organization , a private real estate company , in exchange for an investment of at least $ 100 million . The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building 's construction , and manages the building for the Port Authority , having responsibility for leasing , property management , and tenant installations . By September 2012 , around 55 percent of the building 's floor space had been leased , but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014 ; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8 percent by November 2014 . In 2006 , the State of New York agreed to a 15-year 415,000 square feet ( 38,600 m2 ) lease , with an option to extend the lease 's term and occupy up to 1,000,000 square feet ( 90,000 m2 ) . The General Services Administration ( GSA ) initially agreed to a lease of around 645,000 square feet ( 59,900 m2 ) , and New York State 's Office of General Services ( OGS ) planned to occupy around 412,000 square feet ( 38,300 m2 ) . However , the GSA ceded most of its floor space to the Port Authority in July 2011 , and the OGS withdrew from the lease contract . In April 2008 , the Port Authority announced that it was seeking a bidder to operate the 18,000 sq ft ( 1,700 m2 ) observation deck on the tower 's 102nd floor ; in 2013 , Legends Hospitality Management agreed to operate the observatory in a 15-year , $ 875 million contract . The building 's first lease , a joint project between the Port Authority and Beijing-based Vantone Industrial , was announced on March 28 , 2009 . A 190,810 sq ft ( 17,727 m2 ) \" China Center \" , combining business and cultural facilities , is planned between floors 64 and 69 ; it is intended to represent Chinese business and cultural links to the United States , and to serve American companies that wish to conduct business in China . Vantone Industrial 's lease is for 20 years and 9 months . In April 2011 , a new interior design for the China Center was unveiled , featuring a vertical \" Folding Garden \" , based on a proposal by the Chinese artist Zhou Wei . On August 3 , 2010 , Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications signed a tentative agreement to move the headquarters and offices for its magazines into One World Trade Center , occupying up to 1,000,000 square feet ( 90,000 m2 ) of floor space . On May 17 , 2011 , Cond\u00e9 Nast reached a final agreement with the Port Authority , securing a 25-year lease with an estimated value of $ 2 billion . On May 25 , 2011 , Cond\u00e9 Nast finalized the lease contract , obtaining 1,008,012 square feet ( 93,647.4 m2 ) of office space between floors 20 \u2013 41 . The lease also includes 30,000 square feet ( 2,800 m2 ) of usable space in the podium and below grade floors , for mail , messenger services , and storage use . On January 17 , 2012 , it was reported that Cond\u00e9 Nast would be leasing an additional 133,000 square feet ( 10,000 m2 ) of space , occupying floors 42 through 44 . Conde Nast moved in on November 3 , 2014 . However , some leases had failed . In January 2012 , Chadbourne & Parke , a Midtown Manhattan-based law firm , was to sign a 300,000 square feet ( 30,000 m2 ) lease contract , but after negotiations broke down , the deal was abruptly canceled in March . = = = Key figures = = = = = = = Developer = = = = Larry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties , the leaseholder and developer of the complex , retains control of the surrounding buildings , while the Port Authority has full control of the tower itself . Silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001 , and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site 's redevelopment process . Before construction of the new tower began , Silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower . The terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001 , for which Silverstein paid $ 14 million , gave Silverstein , as leaseholder , the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed . After the September 11 attacks , there were a series of disputes between Silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers ; this resulted in the construction of One World Trade Center being delayed . After a trial resulted , a verdict was given on April 29 , 2004 . The verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the \" one occurrence \" interpretation , so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies . Three insurers were added to the second trial group . At that time , the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer , Swiss Reinsurance , but it did so several days later on May 3 , 2004 , finding that this company was also subject to the \" one occurrence \" interpretation . Silverstein appealed the Swiss Reinsurance decision , but the appeal failed on October 19 , 2006 . The second trial resulted in a verdict on December 6 , 2004 . The jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the \" two occurrences \" interpretation , referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the September 11 attacks . They were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies ( $ 2.2 billion ) . The highest potential payout was $ 4.577 billion , for buildings 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 . In March 2007 , Silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference . He highlighted what he describes as the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $ 800 million in claims related to the attacks . Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern . = = = = Key project coordinators = = = = David Childs , one of Silverstein 's favorite architects , joined the project after Silverstein urged him to do so . He developed a design proposal for One World Trade Center , initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind . In May 2005 , Childs revised the design to address security concerns . He is the architect of the tower , and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development . Architect Daniel Libeskind won the invitational competition to develop a plan for the new tower in 2002 . He gave an initial proposal , which he called \" Memory Foundations \" , for the design of One World Trade Center . His design included aerial gardens , windmills , and off-center spire . Libeskind later denied a request to place the tower in a more rentable location next to the PATH station . He instead placed it another block west , as it would then line up with , and resemble , the Statue of Liberty . Most of Libeskind 's original designs were later scrapped , and other architects were chosen to design the other WTC buildings . However , one element of Libeskind 's initial plan was included in the final design \u2013 the tower 's symbolic height of 1,776 feet ( 541 m ) . Daniel R. Tishman \u2013 along with his father John Tishman , builder of the original World Trade Center \u2013 led the construction team from Tishman Realty & Construction , the selected builder for One World Trade Center . Douglas and Jody Durst , the co-presidents of the Durst Organization , a real estate development company , won the right to invest at least $ 100 million in the project on July 7 , 2010 . In August 2010 , Cond\u00e9 Nast , a long-time Durst tenant , confirmed a tentative deal to move into 1 World Trade Center , and finalized the deal on May 26 , 2011 . The contract negotiated between the Port Authority and the Durst Organization specifies that the Durst Organization will receive a $ 15 million fee , and a percentage of \" base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project \" . The specifics of the signed contract give Durst 75 percent of savings up to $ 24 million , stepping down to 50 , 25 , and 15 percent as savings increase . Since Durst joined the project , significant changes have been made to the building , including the 185 foot base of the tower , the spire , and the plaza to the west of the building , facing the Hudson River . The Port Authority has approved all the revisions . = = = = Port Authority construction workers = = = = A WoodSearch Films short-subject documentary entitled How does it feel to work on One World Trade Center ? was uploaded to YouTube on August 31 , 2010 .

                    "text": "2008 attacks on Uttar Pradeshi and Bihari migrants in Maharashtra = The 2008 attacks on Uttar Pradeshi and Bihari migrants in Maharashtra began on 3 February 2008 after violent clashes between workers of two political parties \u2014 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena ( MNS ) and Samajwadi Party ( SP ) \u2014 at Dadar in Mumbai , capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra . The clashes took place when workers of MNS , a splinter faction formed out of the Shiv Sena ( a major political party of Maharashtra ) , tried to attack workers of SP , the regional party based in Uttar Pradesh , who were proceeding to attend a rally organised by the United National Progressive Alliance ( UNPA ) . Defending his party 's stand , MNS chief Raj Thackeray explained that the attack was a reaction to the \" provocative and unnecessary show of strength \" and \" uncontrolled political and cultural dadagiri ( bullying ) of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants and their leaders \" . In the events leading to these clashes , Raj Thackeray made critical remarks , themed around language politics and regionalism , about migrants from the North Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar , accusing them of spoiling Maharashtrian culture and not mingling with them . At political rallies held across the state , he questioned the loyalty of Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan towards Maharashtra , where he attained \" fame and popularity \" , accusing him of showing \" more interest \" in his native Uttar Pradesh . He called the celebration of Chhath Puja by North Indian migrants a \" drama \" and a \" show of arrogance \" . On 13 February 2008 , the state government , which was accused of reluctance to take immediate action , ultimately arrested Raj Thackeray and Abu Asim Azmi ( a local SP leader ) on charges of instigation of violence and causing communal disturbance . Although released that same day , a gag order was imposed on both leaders to prevent them from making further inflammatory remarks . Meanwhile , tensions in Maharashtra rose as the news of Raj 's possible arrest , and his subsequent actual arrest , angered his supporters . Incidences of violence against North Indians and their property by MNS workers were reported in Mumbai , Pune , Aurangabad , Beed , Nashik , Amravati , Jalna , and Latur . Nearly 25,000 North Indian workers fled Pune , and another 15,000 fled Nashik in the wake of the attacks . The exodus of workers caused an acute labour shortage , affecting local industries . Analysts estimated financial losses of \u20b9 5 billion ( US $ 74 million ) \u2013 \u20b9 7 billion ( US $ 104 million ) . Although the violence receded after the arrests of the two leaders , sporadic attacks were reported until May 2008 . After months of lull , on 19 October 2008 , MNS activists beat up North Indian candidates appearing for the all-India Railway Recruitment Board entrance exam in Mumbai . The incident led to Raj 's arrest and fresh violence . Later on 28 October 2008 a labourer from Uttar Pradesh was lynched in a Mumbai commuter train . The attacks evoked critical reactions from various parts of the country , particularly the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar political leadership . Even Bal Thackeray , Raj 's estranged uncle and chief of the Shiv Sena , who formed his party in 1966 to raise the voice of Marathi manoos ( Marathi people ) , discounted his nephew 's criticism of Bachchan as \" stupidity \" . In an editorial a month later in Saamna , the Shiv Sena 's political mouthpiece , however , Bal Thackeray wrote that Biharis antagonised local populations wherever they went and were an \" unwelcome lot \" throughout the country . The media slated Bal 's remarks as an attempt to recapture his party 's sons-of-soil plank , being hijacked by Raj . = = Background = = = = = Raj Thackeray 's resignation from Shiv Sena and the formation of MNS = = = On 9 March 2006 , Raj Thackeray , nephew of Bal Thackeray , quit the Shiv Sena and formed the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena ( MNS ) after being \" sidelined \" by the chief 's son Uddhav . The Shiv Sainiks ( Shiv Sena members ) who supported Raj 's leadership , in contrast to his cousin Uddhav , joined the MNS . The party was founded on the ideology of being the benefactor of the local Marathi Manoos ( Marathi people ) , an ideology that the party members felt the Shiv Sena had abandoned . Keeping in line with this , Raj has repeatedly demanded special job reservations for locals . A critic of the influx of migrants into the state , especially Uttar Bhartiyas ( literally meaning \" North Indians \" ) predominantly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar , he has blamed the large-scale immigration of people from these economically backward states for causing a shortage of jobs for Maharashtrians . = = = Shiv Sena 's move to appease migrants = = = The Times of India summarised the cause of MNS 's attacks \u2014 \" There 's a method in MNS 's madness in attacking north Indians in Mumbai though , howsoever flawed it might be . Raj believes his cousin and Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray has been wooing the people from Bihar and UP \u2014 through a campaign he began back in 2005 with the inclusive call of Mee Mumbaikar \u2014 as his party 's vote-bank . Uddhav 's growing popularity with North Indians had been rankling Raj , who is losing ground and political relevance as evident in the MNS 's performance in the last municipal elections . \" = = = Raj 's criticism of Amitabh Bachchan = = = In January 2008 , targeting Mumbai-resident Amitabh Bachchan at political rallies , Raj asserted that the actor was \" more interested \" in his native state Uttar Pradesh than Maharashtra . He expressed his disapproval of Amitabh 's inaugurating a girls ' school named after his daughter-in-law , actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan , at Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh , rather than in Maharashtra . Bachchan was also criticised for choosing to run elections from his native state . On 2 February at a party function at Dharavi in Mumbai , Raj said , \" Though he [ Amitabh ] has become a star in Mumbai , his interest is in Uttar Pradesh . That is why he was trying to be an ambassador of UP rather than Maharashtra . That is why though he achieved everything in Mumbai , when it came to elections , Amitabh chose Uttar Pradesh \" . Responding to Raj 's accusations , the actor 's wife and an SP MP Jaya Bachchan said that they ( Bachchans ) were willing to start a school in Mumbai , provided the MNS leader donated the land to build it . She told the media , \" I heard that Raj Thackeray owns huge properties in Maharashtra , in Mumbai at Kohinoor Mills . If he is willing to donate land , we can start a school in the name of Aishwarya here \" . Amitabh , however , abstained from commenting on the issue . Bal Thackeray refuted the allegations , saying , \" Amitabh Bachchan is an open-minded person , he has great love for Maharashtra , and this is evident on many occasions . The actor has often said that Maharashtra and specially Mumbai has given him great fame and affection . He has also said that what he is today is because of the love people have given him . The people of Mumbai have always acknowledged him as an artiste . It was utter foolishness to make these parochial allegations against him . Amitabh is a global superstar . People all over the world respect him . This cannot be forgotten by anyone . Amitabh should ignore these silly accusations and concentrate on his acting \" . According to some reports , Raj 's censure of Amitabh , whom he supposedly admires , stemmed from his disappointment of not being invited to the wedding of Amitabh 's son , Abhishek , despite invitations to his estranged uncle Bal and cousin Uddhav . On 23 March , Amitabh finally spoke out in an interview with a local tabloid , saying , \" Random charges are random ; they do not deserve the kind of attention you wish me to give \" . Later on 28 March at a press conference for the International Indian Film Academy , when asked what his take was on the anti-migrant issue , Amitabh said that it is one 's fundamental right to live anywhere in the country and the constitution entitles so . He also stated that he was not affected by Raj 's comments . = = = Raj 's remarks on Chhath Puja and migrants = = = In his party speeches , Raj had also reproached North Indian migrants on the celebration of Chhath Puja , a festival popular in Bihar , calling it a \" drama \" and a \" show of arrogance \" . He demanded that they must only celebrate Maharashtrian festivals . A petition was filed in the Patna civil court on 8 February against him for his remarks over Chhath Puja . His statements drew flak from leaders of Bihar , especially Indian Railways minister and former chief minister of Bihar , Lalu Prasad Yadav , who challenged that he would come to Mumbai and perform Chhath Puja in front of Raj 's house , also ridiculed Raj saying , \" He [ Raj ] is a child in politics \" . The Navnirman Sena leader accused migrants of swamping Maharashtra , India 's most industrialised state , in search of jobs . The MNS chief had also accused migrants of disrespecting the local culture . On 9 February , expressing his stance on newer migrants settling in Mumbai , Raj said , \" New immigrants to the city should be denied entry into the city , while those already staying here should show respect to the Marathi ' manoos ' and his culture \" . = = = Clashes between MNS and SP workers = = = On 3 February 2008 , MNS and SP workers indulged in street fighting after the former tried to attack the latter , who were proceeding to Shivaji Park , Dadar , in Mumbai to attend a rally organised by the United National Progressive Alliance ( UNPA ) , the ruling coalition party of India , of which the SP is a member . The rally was to be addressed by former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and other prominent members of the UNPA and SP . Police arrested 73 MNS and 19 SP workers after these clashes on charges of rioting . Raj justified his party 's stand as a response to \u2014 \" provocative and unnecessary show of strength \" and \" uncontrolled political and cultural dadagiri of the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants and their leaders \" \u2014 and questioned , \" Do political movements need to obey the law ? \" On 10 February at a press conference , he issued a statement saying , \" What happened in Mumbai in the past one week was only a reaction and if leaders of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar try to demonstrate their strength here , such reactions would recur \" . After the clashes , SP approached the Election Commission demanding de-registration of MNS . SP general secretary whose press conference near Azad Maidan was disrupted by MNS activists on 3 February , Amar Singh petitioned the Commission requesting action against the MNS and its leaders for issuing \" veiled as well as open threats \" against non-Maharashtrians . However , Mumbai police dismissed a complaint of \" criminal intimidation \" filed against Raj by Singh as ' false and malicious ' . In his complaint filed at Azad Maidan police station , Singh had alleged that sloganeering MNS men had threatened him by using Thackeray 's name while being whisked away by security personnel from the venue . = = Attacks = = = = = February = = = On 3 February , immediately after clashes with SP , MNS workers assaulted North Indian taxi drivers and vandalised their vehicles in Dadar , Mumbai . The police faced strong criticism for remaining mute spectators as MNS workers assaulted North Indians . A departmental inquiry was instituted against the police inaction . Inspector Motiram Kadam and sub-inspector Deepak Pawar , who were assigned duty at Dadar , were suspended for dereliction of duty . Later , over 25 MNS workers were arrested on charges of rioting . In the night , 150 suspected MNS activists ransacked Pratap talkies in Thane , pulled out the print of the Bhojpuri film \" Saiyan se Solah Singaar \" and burned it because Bhojpuri is the regional language spoken in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar . The rioters also damaged the theatre and destroyed the seats . A similar incident was reported in Nashik . The next day in Mumbai , two motorcycle-borne MNS supporters hurled bottles at Amitabh Bachchan 's bungalow at Juhu . A group of MNS workers barged inside the booking office of the Grant Road railway station , damaged the booking office windows and tore off posters of a newly released Bhojpuri film put up there . Party workers resorted to stone throwing in some parts of Kandivli , a North-Mumbai suburb that has a sizeable North Indian lower middle-class population . In the Central-Mumbai suburb of Bandra , a clash ensued when MNS workers tried to plant party flags at an open market dominated by North Indians . The offices of Bhojpuri actor Manoj Tiwari and North Indian Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam were stoned by MNS supporters on 5 February . Two days later , a group of 20 to 25 MNS activists forced themselves into the Central Mumbai office of the Bombay Taximen 's Union , where they assaulted office staff and damaged property . In response to the attack , the 55,000-strong Union immediately called for a flash strike . The strike was then called off after R. R. Patil , the Home Minister of Maharashtra , assured the Union of justice and safety . An advocate named Arvind Shukla filed a Public Interest Litigation ( PIL ) seeking directions to the Election Commission to derecognise MNS in view of its \" anti-national activities \" . On 8 February , re-invoking the issue of Marathi pride , Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray on hit out at North Indians again , in a special article titled \" Majhi bhumika , majha ladha \" ( My stand , my struggle ) written by him in the Marathi daily Maharashtra Times , Thackeray said , \" Even if the whole world opposes my stand , I and my party will continue the struggle to protect Marathi culture , Maharashtrian people and will trample the goondaism of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar . At this juncture , I feel like asking the Maharashtrian people that if I am voicing your true emotion , then why are you sitting on the fence . Come join me in this struggle . \" On 12 February , MNS workers attacked vendors and shopkeepers from North India in various parts of Maharashtra and destroyed government property to vent their anger against the reported move to arrest Raj . Sporadic violence was reported in Beed and Aurangabad . State-run buses in these areas were stone-pelted , resulting in the arrest of several MNS workers . In Nashik , MNS workers vandalised several shops belonging to North Indians , forcing other shops and business establishments to close down . One shopkeeper was severely beaten and was admitted to Nashik General Hospital . Banks and schools promptly closed after these incidents . Stone pelting by angry mobs was also reported from the city 's Shalimar and Bytco squares , and the Satpur and Ambad industrial areas remained closed . Nashik police detained 26 MNS workers after the violence . Six municipal cooperators were also put under preventive arrest . Additional police pickets were deployed in various parts of the city , including Shalimar and Ambad Chowk , Satpur , Nashik Road , the MNS head office at Mumbai Naka and some of the city suburbs . In Pune , MNS workers pelted stones on state-run buses and attacked a few shop owners in Pune 's Laxmi Road area , prompting shops to shut down to avoid similar attacks . The Mumbai Police announced its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February , which created an upsurge of violence in the state and led to two deaths . Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai , Pune , Jalna , Beed , Aurangabad and Latur . Shops , offices and other business establishments were shut down in different parts of Mumbai , as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested . Central Mumbai localities were most affected , especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park , the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena . The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area . A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing shop owners to down shutters in JB Nagar , Andheri . John suffered two rib fractures and bruises on his lungs . In Nashik , an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited , a Maharashtrian , died during a stone pelting on state-run buses by MNS supporters . A migrant from Bihar , who was a security guard with a private company at Igatpuri in Nashik district , was killed by a mob . In Mumbai and Aurangabad , police rounded up more than 400 MNS workers . In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad , MNS workers went on a rampage following the arrest of Raj , smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses . Thirteen rioters were arrested . They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets . He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious . When he gained consciousness the following day , he found himself in a hospital with both hands amputated . The injured , mainly hawkers , were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten . Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident . Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road , Ambad , Ravivar Peth , and Gangapur areas . Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani . In Amrawati , MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses , damaging several vehicles in the process . Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed in many parts of the state , the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack . More than 200 activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik . Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations . = = = March \u2013 May = = = The attacks simmered down after mid-February due to the arrest and imposition of a gag order on Raj . Isolated cases of attacks , however , were reported until April 2008 . On 22 March , six North Indians were beaten up by a group of Holi revellers , suspected to be MNS workers , in Santa Cruz , Mumbai . On the same day , a shop owned by a North Indian was ransacked by a group of 10 \u2013 15 drunken men , who pelted stones and beat his children because they had refused to provide free food . On 29 March , motorcycle-borne assailants damaged at least five taxis owned by North Indians in Central Mumbai . Four people were arrested . Four labourers travelling on the Konkan Kanya Express from Thane to Margao in search of jobs were beaten and looted by some men in Raigad district after being identified as North Indians on 1 April . Then on 30 May , a group of North Indians was injured when a mob of approximately 800 MNS activists attacked them at a meeting organised by the SP and some other North Indians fronts . Five North Indians were critically injured in the attack , and the police arrested 35 MNS activists after the incident . = = = October = = = After months of lull in the anti-North Indian offensive , on 19 October 2008 , MNS activists beat up North Indian candidates appearing for the all-India Railway Recruitment Board entrance exam for the Western region in Mumbai . The attack invoked a quick reaction from Lalu Prasad Yadav and his cabinet colleague Ram Vilas Paswan , who too hails from Bihar . Chief minister Nitish Kumar , on the other hand , spoke to his Maharashtra counterpart Vilasrao Deshmukh and urged him to provide protection to the migrants from Bihar . Lalu demanded a ban on the MNS , and described its chief Raj Thackeray as a \" mental case \" . Bihar witnessed violent protest after death of Pawan Mahto , a resident of Bara-Khurd village in Nalanda district , in anticipation that he died after being assaulted by MNS activists . However , railway police clarified , based on the CCTV footage , that Pawan had died due to an accident at Andheri station after slipping at a platform . Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh admitted that his government was responsible for failure in preventing the attacks by MNS on north Indian candidates at Railways examination centres and ordered a probe into the incident , which will also enquire into why the job advertisements where not given in Marathi newspapers . \" What has happened is not good . Such incidents take place because of loopholes in the law . One can 't hold only the Home Ministry responsible for it , it is ( entire ) government 's responsibility . Such incidents are affecting the image of the state and I have instructed the DGP to take stern action , \" Deshmukh said . However , NCP leader Narayan Rane , wrote a piece in 23 October 2008 , issue of ' Prahar ' , in a city newspaper he owns , pleading that Marathis should get their legitimate share in the central government sector . The Times of India noted , the essay indicates that Rane continues to have a soft spot for MNS chief Raj Thackeray \u2013 the two were close friends when Rane was in the Sena . Stating that the Marathis were getting a raw deal in central government jobs such as income tax and the railways , Rane said it was perplexing that of 54,000 , only 54 Marathis were summoned for the railway recruitment exams . The railways must give Marathis their legitimate share in employment , Rane said . On 20 October 2008 , Thackeray was arrested in Ratnagiri after Mumbai police had received a non-bailable warrant issued by a Jamshedpur court against the MNS chief . Raj 's arrest ignited violence by his supporters in large parts of the city forcing it to shut down . Irate supporters went on the rampage torching public transport and telling office goers to return home . Many shops and commercial establishments , especially those run or managed by non-Maharashtrians , chose not to open at all to avoid trouble . Raj , whose MNS workers Sunday attacked non-Maharashtrians appearing for the railway board examination , was brought from Ratnagiri , about 250 km from here , to be produced at the Bandra court , where he was summoned for . There was mayhem outside the court premises with large crowds gathering around restively and camera crews waiting to capture the trouble . In some places , buses , taxis and autorickshaws were set on fire , in others areas public transport just stayed off the roads . The office of the state Congress spokesperson Sanjay Nirupam was also vandalised . A North Indian shopkeeper was killed in Bhandup , Mumbai after he refused to shut down his shop when MNS activists protesting Raj 's arrest forced him to do so . Four persons were killed and another seriously injured in a village near Kalyan . Deputy commissioner of police ( rural ) Sanjay Shintre said two North Indians , a member of the Agri community and an MNS worker were killed in a clash between the two communities in Pisavali , 10 km from Kalyan . Earlier , curfew had been imposed in the entire Kalyan area . The situation in Kalyan worsened in the evening as Raj was driven there to a police station lock-up where he was to spend the night before being presented in a court on 22 October . Five outdoor broadcast vans belonging to media houses were damaged by MNS supporters . A cameraman from ETV was injured and had to be admitted to a private hospital . One Kalyan-Dombivli municipal transport bus was set on fire while five bikes were reduced to ashes . Transport services across Kalyan were paralysed . A jewellery shop was also ransacked by MNS supporters . In all one hundred and twenty-five cases of arson , rioting and stonepelting were registered across the state , including in Pune and Marathwada , by early evening , and 2,085 people were arrested , state director general of police A N Roy said . As news about the arrest spread , there was violence in other parts of Maharashtra too . Sporadic incidents of stone pelting at municipal and private buses were reported in the reat of Maharashtra following the arrest of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Ratnagiri . In Kothrud area , some alleged MNS activists damaged a company 's bus that was taking its employees to workplace . Few Pune Municipal Transport ( PMT ) buses were stoned by miscreants , police said . Meanwhile , police have picked up around 100 MNS activists , including some corporators as a preventive measure . In Nashik , MNS activists set ablaze a truck near PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal 's farm and also damaged another truck at Vilholi-Phata area , police said . Incidents of stone pelting on MSRTC buses and other vehicles were reported in some areas , they said , adding vehicular traffic on the busy Mumbai-Agra-national highway was disrupted following the protest . Police rounded up 70 MNS activists in Nashik incidents and security was tightened in the city . In Solapur , incidents of stone pelting on state transport buses were also reported . In Nagpur MNS party leaders claimed to have damaged several MSRTC buses . Angry students in various parts of Bihar damaged railway property and disrupted train traffic , as a protest . The police said the protesters targeted Patna , Jehanabad , Barh , Khusrupur , Sasaram and Purnia railway stations in the morning . The protesting students reportedly set afire two AC bogies of an express train at Barh railway station . They ransacked Jehanabad , Barh , Purnia and Sasaram railway stations . According to the railway police , at least 10 students were detained in the morning and extra security was deployed to control the situation . A 10-year-old boy was killed when police opened fire on protesters . The child was hit by a stray bullet and died at the scene after police in Rohtas district fired on a mob attacking a train station . A group of 25 people pelted stones on the Maharashtra Bhawan in Khalasi Line , Kanpur , Uttar Pradesh . Constructed in 1928 , the building is owned by the lone trust run by Marathis in Kanpur . = = = January \u2013 May 2009 = = = On 26 January 2009 , MNS activists attacked North Indian residents of Satpur near Nashik who were paying tribute to the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008 and also celebrating ' Uttar Pradesh Din ' through cultural programmes . Eight of them were arrested . In May 2009 , alleged MNS workers tried to disrupt Patna-born actress Neetu Chandra 's intimate photoshoot with a model in Mumbai , claiming that it promoted lesbianism and chanting \" Jai Maharashtra . \" = = Arrests of Raj Thackeray and Abu Asim Azmi = = Raj Thackeray and SP leader Abu Asim Azmi were booked under Indian Penal Code sections 153 ( wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot ) , 153 A ( promoting enmity between groups on the basis of place of birth , residence , etc . ) and 153 B ( imputations , assertions prejudicial to national integration ) on 11 February . The police also applied section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to both politicians and warned them not to hold any press conferences or rallies in the next seven days . On 13 February , however , police arrested both the leaders . Later that day , a local court granted Raj conditional bail and ordered him not to make any speeches that would inflame public tension . He obtained a release after furnishing a personal bond of Rs . 15,000 . Azmi was arrested and taken to the Bhoiwada court in South Central Mumbai and was released on surety of Rs . 10,000 . Raj appealed before the court against the gag order imposed on him , stating that he had to move around different places in Maharashtra for propounding the philosophy of his party and that such an order was an infringement of his ' fundamental rights ' . On 22 February , the court dismissed his appeal to re-track the extension of the gag order passed against him , following which MNS started a signature campaign to get support against the gag order . According to MNS , Maharashtrian actors Nana Patekar and Shreyas Talpade had shown support in opposing the gag order , along with actors Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty . Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty , however , later denied the MNS 's claim . This move by MNS prompted the police to serve a show cause notice to Raj , asking him why the gag order should not be extended . Over 1,800 activists were put under arrest for substantive offences and as a preventive measure since violence had erupted on the streets of Mumbai on 13 February , according to the Joint Commissioner of Mumbai Police ( Law and Order ) , K. L. Prasad . = = = Expression of displeasure by the Supreme Court = = = On 22 February , while hearing two Public Interest Litigations , the Supreme Court of India termed the attacks on North Indians in Mumbai by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists as \" a dangerous trend \" . The three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan , and Justices R V Ravindran and Markandey Katju observed , \" It [ attack on North Indians ] is a very dangerous tendency . What is happening there [ Mumbai ] , we can understand . These [ who were attacked ] are innocent people . We understand the situation there [ in Maharashtra ] and what is happening . This is one country and we will not accept son-of-soil theory . We will not permit Balkanisation of this country . \" The court passed the judgement while hearing two Public Interest Litigations on related issues . While the first , filed by advocate Arvind Shukla , had sought direction to the Election Commission to derecognise Mr Raj Thackeray 's MNS for his controversial remarks against North Indians , the other one , filed by RU Upadhyay , sought protection for the North Indians in Maharashtra and compensation to those who had suffered from the attacks . The court , however , refused to pass any direction on the grounds that the issue was related to the aspect of law and order , and it thus directed the petitioners to have faith in the Bombay High Court and seek further hearing there . In another apparent rebuff to Raj Thackeray , the Supreme Court asserted that every Indian has the right to settle anywhere in the country . A bench consisting of Justices H K Sema and Markandey Katju remarked , \" India is not an association or confederation of states , it is a union of state and there is only one nationality that is Indian . Hence every Indian has a right to go anywhere in India , to settle anywhere , and work and do business of his choice in any part of India peacefully . \" The apex court made the observation while upholding the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation 's move to ban the sale of meat in the town during the nine-day \" Paryushan festival \" observed by the Jain community . = = Exodus of North Indians from Maharashtra = = = = = Nashik = = = The news of Raj 's possible arrest provoked a heightened attack on the North Indians in the industrial town of Nashik in Maharashtra , Raj 's political stronghold . North Indians left the city by buses , trains and private vehicles . Railway officials at Nashik station said that this was the largest crowd using the railroad since the Sinhasta Kumbha Mela in 2003 \u2013 2004 . It was perhaps one of the largest exoduses from a single district in the country ever . Chhagan Bhujbal , Nashik 's guardian minister , reported that 15,000 migrant workers had left the city in the aftermath of the violence against North Indians . = = = Pune = = = In Pune , an estimated 25,000 workers left the city in the wake of the attacks , according to government officials . Pune 's District Guardian Minister Ajit Pawar and Collector Prabhakar Deshmukh held meetings of various people 's representatives to stop the mass departure . They were joined by local Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi , who picketed at Pune railway station to allay fears of those boarding the trains with their family members , carrying their meager belongings . = = = Effects on local industries = = = Local industries in Nashik , especially those located in the Ambad Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation area , were affected due to the large-scale departure of migrant workers . According to a report , 40 percent small and medium industries in the Ambad industrial area had been closed down due to the migration . Though the local industries at Nashik are ancillary units , they provide material to big industries such as Mahindra and Mahindra and Crompton Greaves . Losses resulting from the exodus were estimated to be Rs . 500 \u2013 7 billion . In Pune , where the construction industry was badly hit , some local organisations , working for porters , construction workers and casual labourers , tried to stop the exodus . These organisations set up a National Integration Committee ( NIC ) and charted out confidence-building measures among the migrants in the city . One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage participation of the North Indians in all festivities in the near future . In fact , ninety percent of the labour force in Pune consists of migrants ; 60 percent of these come from Bihar and UP . It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in the city . On 8 September 2008 , Infosys Technologies announced that 3,000 employee positions had been shifted from Pune to Chennai , due to construction delays caused earlier that year by the attacks on North Indian construction workers . = = Political reactions = = The attacks evoked severe responses from political parties and their leaders , particularly of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar . Mayawati , the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh , accused the Congress-ruled Maharashtra government of failing to prevent the attacks . She demanded centre intervention to protect the lives and properties of North Indians in the state . Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said \" Mumbai ujad jayega ( Mumbai will be ruined ) \" . In response to the attacks on taxi drivers and vendors , he added , \" What will happen in Mumbai if taxis go off the roads ? Mumbai will come to a standstill \" . Lalu Prasad Yadav on 5 February 2008 , took up the issue of attacks on North Indians with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and demanded action against those involved in them . Commenting on Raj Thackeray , Lalu Prasad said , \" He is desperate and such type of leader will never be successful in the country . The Government should take action against him and his supporters \" . In the national capital , Delhi , political and social organisations launched street protests and burnt Raj 's effigy , while members of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) ' s Poorvanchal cell held a demonstration demanding that the dismissal of the Maharashtra government . In Allahabad , SP workers tried to obstruct the movement of trains in protest . In Uttar Pradesh 's capital , Lucknow , Nationalist Congress Party activists burnt an effigy of Raj . In Patna , capital of Bihar , RJD 's youth wing staged a demonstration against Raj and the MNS . Thackeray 's effigies were burnt also in Jamshedpur in the state of Jharkhand . Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh condemned Raj 's actions and promised to protect migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and at the same time warned SP from hijacking the situation for political mileage . The Nationalist Congress Party , a key member of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra , also criticised Raj Thackeray and said the campaign was a \" cheap publicity stunt \" . On 6 February 2008 about 200 MNS party workers quit their party and re-joined Shiv Sena , to protest against the MNS 's anti-North Indian agenda . On 9 March , Congress President Sonia Gandhi declared that there should be no leniency towards those stoking regional and communal passions . \" Unity and integrity are the basic conditions for progress of the nation and to fight terrorism . There should be no leniency towards those who seek to discriminate on the basis of religion and region , \" Sonia Gandhi said . She asserted that the country belongs to all with equal rights to it , and that it is the responsibility of all to ensure security of life and property of every citizen in any part of the country . Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha , Lal Krishna Advani of the BJP criticising the attacks commented , \" No political party should say or do anything that weakens the country 's unity or undermines the Constitution \" . BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar alleged that the Congress State government deliberately delayed taking any action when the attacks on North Indians began in Mumbai . He said that he suspected Congress had a strategy to divide Maharashtrian and non-Maharashtrian votes , by creating a feeling of insecurity among non-Maharashtrians in the hope that they would vote for the Congress . He blamed the party for trying to divert people 's attention from more critical problems that Maharashtra faces , such as the agrarian crisis and load shedding . He added , \" India is one and every Indian has a right to settle down and work in any part of the country \" . The Communist Party of India demanded stringent action against those inciting violence and asked democratic forces to launch a united struggle against such elements . The party also accused the media , particularly the electronic media , of encouraging anti-national and parochial forces by giving them \" undue publicity \" . According to a resolution adopted at its 20th national Congress at Hyderabad , no adequate action was against those who indulge in chauvinistic slogans and perpetuate hooliganism , and the ruling Congress-led coalition and the opposition BJP utilised these forces for their local political gains . The resolution also said , \" Opportunistic , parochial and chauvinistic \" forces like Shiv Sena and MNS have exploited the situation for narrow electoral gains and demanded compensation for those affected by the violence . The resolution stated that in 1966 , Bal Thackeray gave anti-South Indian slogans and now his nephew wants to repeat that experience by giving anti-North Indian slogans . The All India Minorities Front ( AIMF ) threatened to launch a nationwide agitation against Raj if he did not mend his ways and avoid targeting North Indians and non-Maharashtrians . = = Media coverage and response = = The anti-North Indian violence was labelled as a ' tirade against North Indians ' by sections of the national media ( The Hindu , The Times of India , Deccan Herald , Hindustan Times , The Economic Times ) and international media ( Khaleej Times ) . The Hindustan Times published a survey on the front page on 15 February , which said that 73 percent of Mumbai believed the insular line of the MNS and its president against North Indians was denting Mumbai 's cosmopolitan image . The Hindustan Times later received a call from the MNS spokesperson Shirish Parkar protesting the findings of the study . Raj blamed the English-language and Hindi-language media of being biased against him and his party . In addition , some held the media responsible of giving Raj undue publicity . According to an SMS / web poll conducted by CNN IBN , 88 percent of the voters were of the opinion that Raj Thackeray was \" feeding on media hype \" . On 11 February , in Pune , a group of about 15 MNS activists burnt 150 copies of The Week , a weekly magazine in English , in reaction to its cover story on Raj 's controversial utterances , portraying him as Mumbai 's Hitler . The Editor-in-Chief of Outlook , Vinod Mehta , said in a debate on the media 's role in the situation , \" Here is a politician [ Raj Thackeray ] propounding an idea that could lead to a civil war in the country . The doctrine had to be challenged and what could the media have done ? While you may argue that some images were in excess , you will also agree we had to report because this fight to the streets \" . Ending the debate on a sarcastic note Mehta said , \" It 's ridiculous ! The politicians are not responsible , the state government isn 't responsible , police are not to be blamed but media is responsible \" . There is no denying that civic amenities in Mumbai are cracking under the added pressure of a migrant population seeking the riches of India 's commercial capital . The solution cannot be wielding a lathi or a sword . Nor can it be in jingoistic expressions of Marathi pride or North Indian chest thumping . Mumbai will do well to remember how the city came together during the train blasts ( 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings ) . No one asked then , who is a migrant and who is a Maharashtrian . It 's dangerous to solve administrative problems with ethnic quick fixes . Painter Pranava Prakash did his exhibition titled \" Chal Hat Be Bihari \" in Jan 2009 in delhi protesting violence against north Indians in Mumbai . = = = Local vernacular media = = = The Marathi daily Maharashtra Times editorial on Raj 's arrest said that his arrest was a big farce , from which he emerged with pomp and style . It condemned the violence that resulted after the arrest that forced thousands of migrant workers to uproot themselves from various parts of Maharashtra . Loksatta criticised the television channels for their relentless replay of just two instances to portray the violent impact of his arrest . The edit blamed Hindi channels for making Mumbai look like Gujarat during the 2002 Gujarat riots . Another editor in the same daily also wrote that the \" Marathi andolan \" ( Marathi demonstration ) will not benefit any party , as the Marathi vote would be divided between the Shiv Sena and MNS . Lokmat , another popular Marathi daily , published a special on a population survey conducted by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences ( TISS ) , according to which , there has been a 21 % decrease in the migrant population in the city since 1961 . The North Indian population , however , witnessed an increase from 12 to 24 percent . Saamna 's editorial asked what wrong Ambadas Bararao , the Maharashtrian man killed in the violence , had committed . The editor of Sakal wrote that although Raj had gained political mileage by taking up the cause of Marathi people , its impact was severe on the migrants , who had to flee the state . Nikhil Wagle , Editor-in-Chief of Lokmat TV , on the day of Raj 's arrest said in an interview with CNBC India that the Mumbai police should have acted against Raj Thackeray and Abu Azmi earlier . He said , \" Had they acted , there would have been no violence . I think the police reacted a little late . \" He expressed his apprehensions about the Shiv Sena stirring up some trouble to compete with Raj Thackeray as he had put the Sena on the back foot . \" Raj Thackeray has stolen the show from Uddhav Thackeray . I think Bal Thackeray will be worried and he will create some trouble . He might give some provocative statements . So , the police have to be observant otherwise it will be a fight between the two brothers and Maharashtra and Mumbai will suffer . \" Indian Express editor Sudheendra Kulkarni 's open letter in Loksatta ( Marathi newspaper owned by The Indian Express ) to Raj Thackeray , in response to Raj 's article in Marathi titled Maazi Bhoomika , Maaza Ladha ( My Stand , My Struggle ) in the Maharashtra Times of 9 February . The letter by Sudheendra which admonished Raj Thackeray for his \" hate speech \" solicited a response from Raj . A similar open letter was addressed to Raj by journalist Rajdeep Sardesai to Raj deploring his party 's actions in the 19 October 2008 All-India Railway Recruitment Board examination attack . * Translated in English ( original text in Marathi ) = = Political analysis = = Political observers commented that the attacks on North Indians by MNS were a \" shrewd ploy \" of their chief Raj to embarrass the Shiv Sena and usurp its core Marathi constituency . They also felt Raj was trying to gain a political foothold by imitating his uncle and political mentor Bal Thackeray , who had headed the anti-South Indian campaign \u2014 \" Lungi Bhagao , Pungi Bajao \" ( throw out those who wear lungis , celebrate by blowing bugles ) \u2014 during the formative years of the Shiv Sena in the 1960s . Kumar Ketkar , the editor of the Marathi daily Loksatta , said though Raj might have achieved what he wanted , but he may have not anticipated the attention it would get . He said , \" He thought the media would gobble it up and just create a small storm that will shift the agenda . But the great Amar Singh and Abu Azmi fuelled the issue by taking him more seriously than what he deserves . The confrontational position aided the MNS volunteers to get into the limelight \" . Ketkar also said the Shiv Sena would lose in the scenario commenting , \" The Sena tried to woo the North Indians after it realised their value as a vote bank in the 2004 defeat . They realised that the demography of the city had changed within a decade . That is when they decided it was time to please the North Indians . Uddhav started organising Uttar Bharatiya functions . This is the year that he bore the fruits of his efforts . That is why Raj decided to strike at the same sentiment that the Sena played in the past \u2014 the Marathi Manoos . \" The author of The Sena Story , Vaibhav Purandare , said Raj resorted to this measure to stem his party 's eroding credibility . He said , \" When Raj launched his party , he first started out with an inclusive approach . When he found that it is not working , he had to do something drastic to get back into the limelight . On the other hand , the Sena was actually becoming inclusive . It even began attracting Muslims into its fold . It also began taking up the common man 's issues like farmer suicides and power supply . This is Raj 's attempt to take the Sena 's mass base away to completely embarrass the Sena . And he has succeeded . \" Both Ketkar and Purandare , however , agreed that Raj was trying to position himself as Bal Thackeray 's potential successor . = = = Alleged Congress support for MNS = = = Shubhangi Khapre of Daily News and Analysis noted in her article titled Forget political will , Raj has state support , stated , \" Ever since its birth on 9 March 2006 , MNS has been nurtured by the ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party ( NCP ) with an ulterior motive of splitting the Shiv Sena . Ironically , the Sena itself was given a ' protected childhood ' in the late 1960s by the then Congress as a tool to war with the Communist Party of India , which had a strong presence in Mumbai . Not surprisingly , covertly the administration has provided Raj adequate platform to consolidate the political forum through an emotive Marathi plank . The purpose is to split the 26 % Marathi voters in Mumbai , which is rather loyal to the Shiv Sena . The electoral merit of the MNS remains untested but its ability to bond with sons of the soil cannot be cursorily dismissed in Mumbai , Thane , Nashik and Pune . \" She further noted , \" Under chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh , the Congress sees a double advantage in the strategy : A proactive MNS will divide Sena voters on the one hand and drive Mumbai \u2019 s North Indian community \u2014 which was being targeted as \" outsiders \" by the MNS \u2014 to Congress \u2019 s lap . North Indians , who dominate 48 essential services in Mumbai , constitute a sizeable \u2014 and hence decisive \u2014 vote bank . Forget political will , it is well-calculated political design which has withheld the Democratic Front government from taking stern action against Raj . Or else , how does one explain home minister RR Patil engaging in a telephone conversation urging him to slow down instead of arresting his men indulging in violence on streets ? \" She also said , \" ( Vilasrao ) Deshmukh is no better . He has often said , \" My administration will not tolerate divisive forces . Nobody is above the law \" . \" She expressed her views in reference to , Bombay High Court on lashing out at the Maharashtra government over the threat given by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena about displaying the Marathi signboard on the shops and establishments in the metropolis . \" If you don 't have political will , then give that message to the people that we can not do anything , \" Division Bench of Justice J N Patel and K K Tated said dissatisfied about government 's inaction against hooliganism of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists . \" Why no action has been taken against respondent number six ( Raj Thackeray ) ? Are some people ' untouchable ' for you ? \" Justice Patel asked as government failed to file a proper reply regarding the action taken . Congress leader Hussain Dalwai said , \" It 's a sad commentary on the administration which has come to a stage where it requires the high court intervention \" . He put the onus of his party 's coalition partner , saying , \" Whether it is MNS violence in the signboard or dalit killing at Khairlanji it shows an insensitive administration . The NCP president Sharad Pawar should seriously reflect on the working of the state home department . \" Even NCP leaders including Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal have told RR Patil and Deshmukh , in the cabinet meet to \" either act or shut up \" . Suggesting that the Maharashtra government was not keen on taking strong action against MNS chief Raj Thackeray , the NDA on Thursday described as \" stage-managed show \" the arrest and bail for him in cases of violence against north Indians in the state . BJP MP Shahnawaz Hussain said , \" Congress is Raj Thackeray 's event management company and it is trying to project Raj 's arrest as an event instead of making any serious effort to check the violent campaign of MNS against north Indians . There is match-fixing between Raj and the Maharashtra government . The state government deliberately books him under small sections and he gets bail . \" Talking on the attacks on North Indian candidates at the All-India Railway Recruitment examinations in Mumbai , Rajya Sabha MP and JD-U national general secretary Shivananda Tiwari also attacked Congress for \" promoting \" the MNS chief and comparing him with slain Punjab separatist leader Bhindarwale . \" Congress party has a mastery in creating ' bhasmasurs ' ( self destructing demons ) . Earlier they created Bhindranwale in Punjab , which killed a Congress Prime Minister . Even this Raj Thackeray is ultimately going to damage Congress , \" Tiwari claimed . He also alleged that Maharashtra government arrested Raj to carry out a \" formality \" and as mild charges were pressed , he got bail soon . = = Resumption of verbal attacks = = = = = Raj Thackeray = = = While still under the gag order , in an interview with the Marathi weekly magazine Lok Prabha of the Indian Express group , Raj was quoted as saying : \" We will go with folded hands and ask them [ North Indians ] to leave . If they refuse , then we will raise our hands . \" Lok Prabha editor Pravin Tokekar said : \" The MNS chief has technically not made any inflammatory statement . Even when he says he and his party would go with folded hands to people asking them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse , he treads the ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se \" . On 3 March , at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park , after the expiry of the gag order , Raj announced , \" I have not given up my mission \" , thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue . Then on 3 May , despite legal warnings by the police before his rally , Raj issued a diktat to his supporters to take action whenever they encountered \" injustice \" . At a rally at Shivaji Park , he said , \" That north Indians are living in Mumbai is because of our mercy . Let it be known \" . He told MNS leaders to shed their complacence and advised his supporters to \" take action \" whenever they felt necessary . He warned that North Indians who did not speak Marathi and did not respect Marathi culture would be driven away . Raj dared the police in his speech by saying , \" Arrest me for this if you can \" . After analysing the speech amidst demand for action against the MNS chief a senior police official quoted it was \" difficult to find an explicit threat or provocation \" in the text of his speech to initiate strong legal action against him and \" it seems he [ Raj ] consulted legal experts before making the speech \" . = = = Bal Thackeray = = = On 6 March , Bal Thackeray issued an editorial titled Ek Bihari , Sau Bimari ( One Bihari , Hundred illnesses ) in Saamna , Shiv Sena 's political mouthpiece , saying Biharis were \" an unwanted lot \" in the country . In what was termed as an apparent bid to recapture his party 's Marathi sons of soil plank , which was being hijacked by the MNS leader Raj , Thackeray wrote about Biharis , \" They [ Biharis ] are not wanted in southern India , Assam and also Punjab and Chandigarh . The Biharis have antagonised local population wherever they had settled . The UP-Bihari MPs have shown their ingratitude towards Mumbai and Maharashtra with an anti-Marathi tirade in Parliament . \" He also denounced Bihari MPs , saying they were \" spitting in the same plate from which they ate \" by criticising Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians . He also wrote , \" They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished , by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains \" . The outburst was apparently in response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in protest against the attacks on North Indians . Bihar chief minister , Nitish Kumar , upset with the remarks , demanded that the Prime Minister and the Centre intervene in the matter immediately . The Saamna editorial prompted at least 16 Lok Sabha MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh , belonging to the RJD , JD ( U ) , SP and the Congress , to give notice for breach of privilege proceedings against Bal Thackeray . After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said : \" If anybody has made any comment on our members ' functioning in the conduct of business in the House , not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves , but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms . Nobody will be spared \" . On 27 March , in protest against Bal Thackeray 's editorial , leaders of Shiv Sena in Delhi resigned citing its \" outrageous conduct \" towards non-Marathis in Maharashtra and announced that they will form a separate party . Addressing a press conference Shiv Sena 's North India chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal said the decision to leave the party was taken because of the \" partial attitude \" of the party high command towards Maharashtrians . \" Shiv Sena is no different from Khalistan and Jammu and Kashmir militant groups which are trying to create a rift between people along regional lines . The main aim of these forces is to split our country . Like the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena , the Shiv Sena too has demeaned North Indians and treated them inhumanely \" , he said . Evaluating the developments , political observers in Mumbai remarked that the Shiv Sena had been \" caught in a bind \" by Raj 's campaign as it had in recent years sought to portray an inclusive image to try to woo the significant migrant vote in the Mumbai and Thane region in the run-up to the Assembly elections in 2009 . To balance this strategy , the party had started speaking up for Maharashtrians to remind them that it was the Shiv Sena was the original voice of the local people .",

He is most famous as the creator of the comic strip Barney Google , later retitled Barney Google and Snuffy Smith . The strip was especially popular in the 1920s and 1930s , and featured a number of well-known characters , including the title character , Bunky , Snuffy Smith , and Spark Plug the race horse . Spark Plug was a merchandising phenomenon , and has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s . DeBeck drew with a scratchy line in a \" big-foot \" style , in which characters had giant feet and bulbous noses . His strips often reflected his love of sports . In 1946 , the National Cartoonists Society inaugurated the Billy DeBeck Memorial Awards ( or the Barney Awards ) , which became the Reuben Award in 1954 . = = Life and career = = = = = Early life = = = William Morgan DeBeck was born on April 15 , 1890 on the South Side of Chicago , where his father , Louis DeBeck , was a newspaperman employed by the Swift Company . The elder DeBeck was French , and the name DeBeck was originally spelled DeBecque . His Irish-Welsh mother , Jessie Lee Morgan , had lived on a farm and was a schoolteacher . = = = Early career = = = After graduating from Hyde Park High School in 1908 , DeBeck attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts . He sold cartoon drawings during this time to finance himself , at first in 1908 for the Chicago Daily News . His caricatures of models drew the attention of his fellow students , and though he had intended to become a painter in the Flemish tradition , he quit the Academy after two years after he got a cartooning job with the weekly paper Show World in 1910 . His cartoons showed the influence of John T. McCutcheon and Clare Briggs , whom he had admired in his youth ; he also had the skill to draw in the more fastidiously cross-hatched style of a Charles Dana Gibson , copies of whose drawings he sold as originals . DeBeck soon left Show World for better opportunities at Youngstown Telegram in Ohio as a editorial cartoonist , then again at the Pittsburgh Gazette-Time in late August 1912 . He later contributed cartoons to the New York City humor magazines Life and Judge . While living in Pittsburgh , he traveled to New York to show comic strip samples to Arthur Brisbane , an editor working for William Randolph Hearst 's newspaper empire ; Brisbane rejected the work . DeBeck later stated the examples \" were terrible \" as he \" had been doing political cartoons for the Pittsburgh Gazette , and the comics were new \" to him . He returned to Youngstown and married Marian Louise Shields there in 1914 . Some time later they divorced , remarried in 1921 , and eventually divorced again . In May 1915 , DeBeck and a partner named Carter launched a newspaper syndicate and correspondence cartooning course ; DeBeck 's advice to his correspondence students was : \" First learn how to draw \u2014 then go to a good art school and get a firm foundation in the arts \" . The school was not a success , and DeBeck returned to Chicago and joined the Chicago Herald in December 1915 . He worked on a strip called Finn an ' Haddie for the Adams Newspaper Service on the side . On December 9 , immediately after starting at the Herald , he began a strip called Married Life that so caught the attention of Hearst ; legend says that , to acquire DeBeck , Hearst bought the Herald and merged it with the Chicago Examiner , as DeBeck had refused to join the Hearst empire after the Examiner raised his monthly salary from $ 35 to $ 200 . DeBeck 's creations were first adapted to film when an animated version of Married Life appeared in a Seattle Sunday Times newsreel in 1917 . DeBeck created a number of other features , especially for the sports section , while his antics made him something of a local celebrity . = = = Barney Google = = = On July 17 , 1919 , a new comic strip by DeBeck in the vein of Married Life on the sports page ; Take Barney Google , For Instance differed in that it was about a henpecked , sports-obsessed husband and his travails defying his wife . Google was interested in non-fictional sports stories , such as the heavyweight championship between Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey . It was not long before DeBeck refigured the tall , thin Google into the short , squat character he was to be remembered as , and the title too was soon shortened to Barney Google . It was not popular until DeBeck had Google acquire a race horse named Spark Plug ( nicknamed \" Sparky \" ) in a strip dated July 17 , 1922 . The dilapidated , blanket-covered horse became such a marketing and merchandising phenomenon that the character has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s \u2014 toys , balloons , and games were among the popular items adorned with Sparky 's image . When DeBeck introduced the horse , he also introduced a little-used technique into the strip : continuity . Barney Google went from being a gag-a-day strip to one in which both humor and suspense kept readers coming back each day , as Google desperately tried to get his horse to win a race . The sequence in which Spark Plug was introduced into the strip was republished in the October 1922 issue of Comic Monthly \u2014 likely the earliest newsstand comics periodical . DeBeck kept readers on the edges of their seats with uncertain suspense : sometimes Spark Plug actually won a race . While DeBeck resisted at first , Hearst demanded a pretty girl be introduced into the strip . DeBeck brought in Sweet Mama , which initially created a stir , and certain papers dropped the strip , but after the phrase swept the nation , the strip 's popularity only increased . Over the years , DeBeck was credited with introducing more neologisms and catchphrases , such as \" heebie-jeebies \" , \" horsefeathers \" , \" balls of fire \" and \" time 's a-wastin ' \" . In 1923 , Billy Rose penned a Tin Pan Alley pop hit called \" Barney Google ( with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes ) \" . A series of Barney Google live-action films starring Barney Hellum appeared in 1928 and 1929 . DeBeck had included a topper called Bughouse Fables ( signed \" Barney Google ) \" with his main strip since 1921 , though he soon handed it off to assistant Paul Fung . On May 16 , 1926 , he replaced Bughouse Fables with Parlor , Bedroom & Sink Starring Bunky , a strip that was popular enough on its own to survive until 1948 . According to later Barney Google and Snuffy Smith scripter Brian Walker , DeBeck had become \" one of the highest-paid cartoonists in America \" at this point . In the early 1920s , DeBeck moved to Riverside Drive in New York City , and in 1927 remarried Mary Louise Dunne . The couple spent the next two years in Europe , after which they settled down again in New York . DeBeck 's active lifestyle sometimes caused him to miss deadlines . He enjoyed traveling , deep sea fishing , golf and playing bridge . As a golfer since 1916 , DeBeck spent time on courses with such notables as Harold Lloyd , Walter Huston , Rube Goldberg , Fontaine Fox , Clarence Budington Kelland and bridge authority P. Hal Sims . He was also acquainted with such celebrities as Babe Ruth , Lowell Thomas and Damon Runyon . His best friend was the cartoonist Frank Willard , who also attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts . = = = Snuffy Smith = = = Barney Google 's popularity persisted into the Depression era ; in 1933 , Fortune magazine reported DeBeck 's weekly earnings at $ 1200 . In the spring of 1934 , DeBeck hired 17-year-old Fred Lasswell as an assistant after seeing his work on a poster . He wanted a letterer for Barney Google , and Lasswell 's lettering impressed him . Lasswell started by doing chores for DeBeck , as well as taking on lettering and other duties on the strip . DeBeck undertook educating Lasswell in cartooning , having him attend schools , copy the works of masters like Gibson and May , and copy line-for-line the artwork from DeBeck 's own comics . Lasswell moved in with the DeBecks , and would tag along with them wherever they moved . He would take over his mentor 's strip after his death and continue it into the 21st century . DeBeck gained a growing interest into the culture of Appalachia in the 1930s and amassed a library on the subject that he later donated to Virginia Commonwealth University . Among the books he admired were those featuring Sut Lovingood by George Washington Harris ; inside Sut Lovingwood Yarns ( 1867 ) DeBeck produced his first sketch of Snuffy Smith , a character that grew from talking with and sketching the Appalachian hillbilly locals . Just as the strip 's circulation was starting to flag , DeBeck introduced Snuffy in a storyline in which Barney inherited an estate in the mountains of North Carolina . After dodging the ornery hillbilly 's bullets , the two became fast friends . The strip was eventually renamed Barney Google and Snuffy Smith , and Snuffy would take over from Barney Google as the central character . Lasswell , with his own country roots , provided much of the inspiration for Snuffy and his Appalachian environment . Especially , he provided a source for the locals ' dialect . Hillbilly culture enjoyed much popularity in the 1930s ; Snuffy Smith appeared the same year as Al Capp 's Li 'l Abner . By 1940 , DeBeck 's strip appeared in 210 newspapers with a combined circulation of ten million . The Charles Mintz studios produced four full-color animated Barney Google and Snuffy Smith shorts in 1935 . The series had two more live-action adaptations in 1942 : Bud Duncan starred as Snuffy Smith in Private Snuffy Smith and co-starred with Cliff Nazarro as Barney Google in Hillbilly Blitzkrieg . = = = Later life and death = = = DeBeck had a studio apartment on Park Avenue in New York , and homes in Great Neck in New York and St. Petersburg in Florida . In the early 1940s , he developed cancer and found it increasingly difficult to work . Sensing his end was near , he made a special trip to see Marian Shields . His last signed daily strip appeared July 4 , 1942 , and his last Sunday the following August 2 . With Lasswell contributing to the war effort , the strip continued under an assistant , Joe Musial . On November 11 , 1942 , DeBeck died at the age of 52 in New York City , with his wife at his bedside . They had no children . Barney Google appeared in 206 newspapers at the time , and Musial continued the strip until Lasswell took it on full-time in 1945 . Over time , Barney faded from the strip , and the title contracted to Snuffy Smith . In 1943 , Mary DeBeck donated to the Ringling School of Art all of her husband 's art supplies , including drawing tables , reams of drawing paper , hundreds of colored pencils , lamps , drawing boards , inks , drawing pens , artist smocks , etching plates , and an etching press . Mary remarried , and she died February 14 , 1953 , aboard a DC-6 from National Airlines which plummeted into the Gulf of Mexico during a thunderstorm on a flight from Tampa , Florida to New Orleans . = = Style = = DeBeck 's drawing style falls in the \" big-foot \" tradition of American comic strips such as The Katzenjammer Kids , H\u00e4gar the Horrible , and Robert Crumb . It had a scratchy line and characters with bulbous noses and giant feet . Though he often procrastinated , DeBeck could work quickly and make it just in time for his deadlines . DeBeck put Barney Google through great changes throughout his twenty-three-year run on the strip , changing situations and characters frequently . The storylines reflected the outlook of the 1920s boom years , the Great Depression , and World War II . = = Legacy = = DeBeck 's main strip continued in the hands of Fred Lasswell long after its creator 's death . The number of newspaper that carried it had been flagging in the years leading to DeBeck 's passing , partly because the hillbilly dialect in the dialogue was difficult to read for many . The syndicate informed Lasswell that if many more newspapers dropped the strip , it would be canceled . Lasswell refocused on Snuffy Smith , dropped much of the dialect , and moved away from continuity to a gag-a-day format . The strip 's popularity once again increased , and by 1989 it was running in 900 newspapers in 21 countries . It has continued in different hands since Lasswell 's death in 2001 . Debeck 's hillbilly depictions , though stereotyped and distorted , had a higher degree of accuracy that those of Al Capp or other contemporary cartoonists , and painted hillbillies in a better light . DeBeck included authentic expressions such as \" plime-blank \" ( \" exactly \" ) and \" a lavish of \" ( \" a lot of \" ) , and included explanations of dialect unfamiliar to his readers . Some such as country singer Roy Acuff objected that the strip perpetuated stereotypes of hillbilly culture . DeBeck is credited with introducing or popularizing a number of neologisms and catchphrases via Barney Google , including \" heebie-jeebies \" , \" horsefeathers \" , \" hotsy totsy \" , \" balls of fire \" , \" time 's a-wastin ' \" , \" touched in the head \" , and \" bodacious \" . Charles M. Schulz , creator of the Peanuts comic strip , was nicknamed \" Sparky \" after DeBeck 's racehorse character , and DeBeck 's drawing style has been an influence on contemporary cartooning and popular culture , and on such later cartoonists as Robert Crumb and Bobby London . The Barney Google Sunday page for September 18 , 1938 was placed in the time capsule at the 1939 World 's Fair . The National Cartoonists Society 's annual award was originally named the Billy DeBeck Memorial Award . Created by Mary DeBeck Bergman in 1946 , these were known as the Barney Awards . She also made the annual presentation of engraved silver cigarette cases , with DeBeck 's characters etched on the cover , to the winners ( Milton Caniff , Al Capp , Chic Young , Alex Raymond , Roy Crane , Walt Kelly , Hank Ketcham and Mort Walker ) . In 1954 , after her death , the DeBeck Award was renamed the Reuben Award after Rube Goldberg , and all of the earlier winners were re-awarded Reuben statuettes . = = List of comic strips = = Finn an ' Haddie ( 1916 ) Married Life ( 1916 ) Olie Moses and Mara , Inc Take Barney Google , F 'rinstance ( 1919 ) , later Barney Google , then Barney Google and Snuffy Smith Bughouse Fables , soon taken over by DeBeck 's assistant , Paul Fung Parlor , Bedroom & Sink ( 1926 ) , later Bunky",

I bought them to use on my new ceramic cook ware and they are GREAT! They do not scratch my cook ware, stove top or anything else. I'm not a fan of sponges, but I really like these. I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks. Normally, I'd have thrown it away by now, but, again, no odors and whatever I clean up comes right out of the sponge. I do use a liquid cleaner on these after use. I'd recommend these."
