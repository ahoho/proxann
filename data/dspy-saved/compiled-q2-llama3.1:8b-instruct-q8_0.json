        "doc": "WWV ( radio station ) = WWV is the call sign of the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology 's ( NIST ) HF ( \" shortwave \" ) radio station near Fort Collins , Colorado . WWV continuously transmits official U.S. Government frequency and time signals on 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 MHz . These carrier frequencies and time signals are controlled by local atomic clocks traceable to NIST 's primary standard in Boulder , Colorado by GPS common view observations and other time transfer methods . NIST also operates the very similar radio station WWVH in Kauai , Hawaii . WWV and WWVH make recorded announcements ; since they share frequencies , WWV uses a male voice to distinguish itself from WWVH , which uses a female voice . They also make other recorded announcements of general interest , e.g. , the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings . WWV shares its site near Fort Collins with radio station WWVB that transmits carrier and time code ( no voice ) on 60 kHz in the LF ( \" longwave \" ) band . = = History = = = = = Launch = = = WWV is the oldest continuously-operating radio station in the United States , first going on the air from Washington , D.C. in May 1920 , approximately six months before the launch of KDKA . The station first broadcast Friday evening concerts on 600 kHz , and its signal could be heard 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) from Washington . On December 15 , 1920 , WWV began broadcasting on 750 kHz , distributing Morse code news reports from the Department of Agriculture . This signal could be heard up to 300 kilometers ( 190 mi ) from Washington . These news broadcasts ended on April 15 , 1921 . = = = Standard frequency signals = = = At the end of 1922 , WWV 's purpose shifted to broadcasting standard frequency signals . These signals were desperately needed by other broadcasters , because equipment limitations at the time meant that the broadcasters could not stay on their assigned frequencies . Testing began on January 29 , 1923 , and frequencies from 200 to 545 kHz were broadcast . Frequency broadcasts officially began on March 6 , 1923 . The frequencies were accurate to \" better than three-tenths of one percent . \" At first , the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next , using a wavemeter . The first quartz oscillators were invented in the mid-1920s , and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV 's frequency broadcasts . In 1926 , WWV was nearly shut down . Its signal could only cover the eastern half of the United States , and other stations located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant . The station 's impending shutdown was announced in 1926 , but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service . Later , in 1931 , WWV underwent an upgrade . Its transmitter , now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator , was moved to College Park , Maryland . Broadcasts began on 5 MHz . A year later , the station was moved again , to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville , Maryland . Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15 MHz , power was increased , and time signals , an A440 tone , and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937 . WWV was nearly destroyed by a fire on November 6 , 1940 . The frequency and transmitting equipment was recovered , and the station was back on the air ( with reduced power ) on November 11 . Congress funded a new station in July 1941 , and it was built 5 kilometres ( 3.1 mi ) south of the former location , still referred to as Beltsville ( although in 1961 the name used for the transmitter location would be changed to Greenbelt , Maryland ) . WWV resumed normal broadcasts on 2.5 , 5 , 10 , and 15 MHz on August 1 , 1943 . = = = Time signals = = = WWV 's primary purpose today ( and for most of its existence ) is to disseminate the \" official U.S. time \" ( provided by government entities such as NIST and USNO ) to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world . The time signals generated by WWV allow time-keeping devices such as radio-controlled clocks to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment . These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations - these include shipping , transport , technology , research , education , military , public safety and telecommunications . It is of particular importance in broadcasting , whether it be commercial , public , or private interests such as amateur radio operators . WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge ( other than the cost of the receiving equipment itself ) . WWV had been broadcasting second pulses since 1937 , but these pulses were not tied to actual time . In June 1944 , the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO 's clock as a source for its time signals . Over a year later , in October 1945 , WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes . Voice announcements started on January 1 , 1950 , and were broadcast every five minutes . Frequencies of 600 Hz and 440 Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes . By this time , WWV was broadcasting on 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , and 35 MHz . The 30 and 35 MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953 . A binary-coded decimal time code began testing in 1960 , and became permanent in 1961 . This \" NASA time code \" was modulated onto a 1000 Hz audio tone at 100 Hz , sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated \" baaga-bong \" . The code was also described as sounding like a \" buzz-saw \" . On July 1 , 1971 , the time code 's broadcast was changed to the present 100 Hz subcarrier , which is inaudible when using a normal radio ( but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder ) . WWV moved to its present location near Fort Collins on December 1 , 1966 , enabling better reception of its signal throughout the continental United States . WWVB signed on in that location three years earlier . In April 1967 , WWV stopped using the local time of the transmitter site ( Eastern Time until 1966 , and Mountain Time afterwards ) and switched to broadcasting Greenwich Mean Time or GMT . The station switched again , to Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) , in 1974 . The 20 and 25 MHz broadcasts were discontinued in 1977 , but the 20 MHz broadcast was reinstated the next year . As of April 4 , 2014 , the 25 MHz signal has been back on the air in an ' experimental ' mode . The voice used on WWV was that of Don Elliott Heald until August 13 , 1991 , when equipment changes required rerecording the announcer 's voice . The one used at that time was that of John Doyle , but was soon switched to the voice of KSFO morning host Lee Rodgers . The radio signals of WWV , WWVB and WWVH , along with the atomic clocks that their time signals derive from , are maintained by NIST 's Time and Frequency Division , which is based in nearby Boulder , Colorado . The Time and Frequency Division is part of the NIST 's Physics Laboratory , based in Gaithersburg , Maryland . NIST 's predecessor , the National Bureau of Standards , previously maintained WWV as a part of the Department of Agriculture ; NIST is currently part of the Department of Commerce . = = = WWV and Sputnik = = = WWV 's 20 MHz signal was used for a unique purpose in 1958 : to track the disintegration of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft 's onboard electronics failed . Dr. John D. Kraus , a professor at Ohio State University , knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake a small amount of ionized air . This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth , strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds . This effect is known as meteor scatter . Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect , but on a larger scale . His prediction was correct ; WWV 's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute . In addition , the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik 's last orbits . Using this information , Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik 's disintegration . In particular , he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit ; instead , the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth . = = = Call Sign = = = WWV is one of a small number of radio stations west of the Mississippi River with a call sign beginning with W. The W call sign stems from the station 's early locations in D.C. and Maryland \u2014 the call sign was maintained when the federal government moved the station to Colorado \u2014 and the fact that WWV , being a government station , does not fall within the FCC 's jurisdiction with respect to call signs . How and why the call sign WWV was assigned to the time signal station are not known . However FCC regulations do dictate that time stations are to be issued call signs beginning with \" WWV \" . = = Broadcast format = = On top of the standard carrier frequencies , WWV carries additional information using standard double-sideband amplitude modulation . WWV 's transmissions follow a regular pattern repeating each minute . They are coordinated with its sister station WWVH to limit interference between them . Because they are so similar , both are described here . = = = Date and time = = = WWV transmits the date and exact time as follows : English-language voice announcements of time . Binary-coded decimal time code of date and time , transmitted as varying length pulses of 100 Hz tone , one bit per second . In both cases the transmitted time is given in Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) . = = = Per-second ticks and minute markers = = = WWV transmits audio \" ticks \" once per second , to allow for accurate manual clock synchronization . These ticks are always transmitted , even during voice announcements and silent periods . Each tick begins on the second , lasts 5 ms and consists of 5 cycles of a 1000 Hz sine wave . To make the tick stand out more , all other signals are suppressed for 40 ms , from 10 ms before the second until 30 ms after ( 25 ms after the tick ) . As an exception , no tick ( and no silent interval ) is transmitted at 29 or 59 seconds past the minute . In the event of a leap second , no tick is transmitted during second 60 of the minute , either . On the minute , the tick is extended to a 0.8 second long beep , followed by 0.2 s of silence . On the hour , this minute pulse is transmitted at 1500 Hz rather than 1000 . The beginning of the tone corresponds to the start of the minute . Between seconds one and sixteen inclusive past the minute , the current difference between UTC and UT1 is transmitted by doubling some of the once-per-second ticks , transmitting a second tick 100 ms after the first . ( The second tick preempts other transmissions , but does not get a silent zone . ) The absolute value of this difference , in tenths of a second , is determined by the number of doubled ticks . The sign is determined by the position : If the doubled ticks begin at second one , UT1 is ahead of UTC ; if they begin at second nine , UT1 is behind UTC . WWVH transmits similar 5 ms ticks , but they are sent as 6 cycles of 1200 Hz . The minute beep is also 1200 Hz , except on the hour when it is 1500 Hz . The ticks and minute tones are transmitted at 100 % modulation ( 0 dBFS ) . = = = Voice time announcements = = = Voice announcements of time of day are made at the end of every minute , giving the time of the following minute beep . The format for the voice announcement is , \" At the tone , X hours , Y minute ( s ) , Coordinated Universal Time . \" The announcement is in a male voice and begins 7.5 seconds before the minute tone . WWVH makes an identical time announcement , starting 15 seconds before the minute tone , in a female voice . When voice announcements were first instituted , they were phrased as follows : \" National Bureau of Standards , WWV ; when the tone returns , [ time ] Eastern Standard Time . \" After the 1967 switch to UTC , the announcement changed to \" National Bureau of Standards , WWV , Fort Collins , Colorado ; next tone begins at X hours , Y minute ( s ) , Greenwich Mean Time . \" However , this format would be short-lived . The announcement was changed again to the current format in 1971 . Voice time announcements are sent at 75 % modulation , i.e. the carrier varies between 25 % and 175 % of nominal power . = = = Standard frequencies = = = WWV and WWVH transmit 44 seconds of audio tone in most minutes . It begins after the 1-second minute mark and continues until the beginning of the WWVH time announcement 45 seconds after the minute . Even minutes ( except for minute 2 ) transmit 500 Hz , while 600 Hz is heard during odd minutes . The tone is interrupted for 40 ms each second by the second ticks . WWVH is similar , but exchanges the two tones : 600 Hz during even minutes and 500 Hz during odd . WWV also transmits a 440 Hz tone , a pitch commonly used in music ( A440 , the note A above middle C ) during minute : 02 of each hour , except for the first hour of the UTC day . Since the 440 Hz tone is only transmitted once per hour , many chart recorders may use this tone to mark off each hour of the day , and likewise , the omission of the 440 Hz tone once per day can be used to mark off each twenty-four-hour period . WWVH transmits the same tone during minute : 01 of each hour . No tone is transmitted during voice announcements from either WWV or WWVH ; the latter causes WWV to transmit no tone during minutes : 43 \u2013 : 51 ( inclusive ) and minutes : 29 and : 59 of each hour . Likewise , WWVH transmits no tone during minutes : 00 , : 30 , : 08 \u2013 : 10 and : 14 \u2013 : 19 . Audio tones and other voice announcements are sent at 50 % modulation . = = = Other voice announcements = = = WWV transmits the following 44-second voice announcements ( in lieu of the standard frequency tones ) on an hourly schedule : A station identification at : 00 and : 30 past each hour ; marine storm warnings , provided by the National Weather Service , for the Atlantic Ocean at : 08 and : 09 minutes past , and for the Pacific Ocean at : 10 past ; at : 14 and : 15 past , GPS satellite health reports from the Coast Guard Navigation Center ; at : 18 past , a special \" geophysical alert \" report from NOAA is transmitted , containing information on solar activity and shortwave radio propagation conditions . These particular alerts were to be discontinued on September 6 , 2011 . However , as of June 17 , 2011 , WWV is announcing at : 18 past that the decision has been retracted and that the geophysical alert reports \" will continue for the foreseeable future \" . Additional time slots are normally transmitted as a standard frequency tone , but can be preempted by voice messages if necessary : At : 04 and : 16 past the hour , NIST broadcasts any announcements regarding a manual change in the operation of WWV and WWVH , such as leap second announcements . These minutes are marked in the broadcast schedule as \" NIST Reserved \" . When not used , a 500 Hz tone is broadcast . Minute 11 is used for additional storm warnings if necessary . If not , a 600 Hz tone is transmitted . WWVH transmits the same information on a different schedule . WWV and WWVH 's voice announcements are timed to avoid crosstalk ; WWV airs dead air when WWVH airs voice announcements , and vice versa . WWVH 's storm warnings cover the area around the Hawaiian islands and the Far East rather than North America . = = = = Digital time code = = = = Time of day is also continuously transmitted using a digital time code , interpretable by radio-controlled clocks . The time code uses a 100 Hz subcarrier of the main signal . That is , it is an additional low-level 100 Hz tone added to the other AM audio signals . This code is similar to , and has the same framework as , the IRIG H time code and the time code that WWVB transmits , except the individual fields of the code are rearranged and are transmitted with the least significant bit sent first . Like the IRIG timecode , the time transmitted is the time of the start of the minute . Also like the IRIG timecode , numeric data ( minute , hour , day of year , and last two digits of year ) are sent in binary-coded decimal ( BCD ) format rather than as simple binary integers : Each decimal digit is sent as two , three , or four bits ( depending on its possible range of values ) . = = = = = Bit encoding = = = = = The 100 Hz subcarrier is transmitted at \u2212 15 dBFS ( 18 % modulation ) beginning at 30 ms from the start of the second ( the first 30 ms are reserved for the seconds tick ) , and then reduced by 15 dB ( to \u2212 30 dBFS , 3 % modulation ) at one of three times within the second . The duration of the high amplitude 100 Hz subcarrier encodes a data bit of 0 , a data bit of 1 , or a \" marker \" , as follows : If the subcarrier is reduced 800 ms past the second , this indicates a \" marker . \" If the subcarrier is reduced 500 ms past the second , this indicates a data bit with value one . If the subcarrier is reduced 200 ms past the second , this indicates a data bit with value zero . A single bit or marker is sent in this way in every second of each minute except the first ( second : 00 ) . The first second of each minute is reserved for the minute marker , previously described . In the diagram above , the red and yellow bars indicate the presence of the 100 Hz subcarrier , with yellow representing the higher strength subcarrier ( \u2212 15 dB referenced to 100 % modulation ) and red the lower strength subcarrier ( \u2212 30 dB referenced to 100 % modulation ) . The widest yellow bars represent the markers , the narrowest represent data bits with value 0 , and those of intermediate width represent data bits with value 1 . = = = = = Interpretation = = = = = It takes one minute to transmit a complete time code . Most of the bits encode UTC time , day of year , year of century , and UT1 correction up to \u00b1 0.7 s . Like the WWVB time code , only the tens and units digits of the year are transmitted ; unlike the WWVB time code , there is no direct indication for leap year . Thus , receivers assuming that year 00 is a leap year ( correct for year 2000 ) will be incorrect in the year 2100 . On the other hand , receivers that assume year 00 is not a leap year will be correct for 2001 through 2399 . The table below shows the interpretation of each bit , with the \" Ex \" column being the values from the example above . The example shown encodes day 86 ( March 27 ) of 2009 , at 21 : 30 : 00 UTC . DUT1 is + 0.3 , so UT1 is 21 : 30 : 00.3 . Daylight Saving Time was not in effect at the previous 00 : 00 UTC ( DST1 = 0 ) , and will not be in effect at the next 00 : 00 UTC ( DST2 = 0 ) . There is no leap second scheduled ( LSW = 0 ) . The day of year normally runs from 1 ( January 1 ) through 365 ( December 31 ) , but in leap years , December 31 would be day 366 , and day 86 would be March 26 instead of March 27 . = = = = = Daylight saving time and leap seconds = = = = = The time code contains three bits announcing daylight saving time ( DST ) changes and imminent leap seconds . Bit : 03 is set near the beginning of the month which is scheduled to end in a leap second . It is cleared when the leap second occurs . Bit : 55 ( DST2 ) is set at UTC midnight just before DST comes into effect . It is cleared at UTC midnight just before standard time resumes . Bit : 02 ( DST1 ) is set at UTC midnight just after DST comes into effect , and cleared at UTC midnight just after standard time resumes . If the DST1 and DST2 bits differ , DST is changing during the current UTC day , at the next 02 : 00 local time . Before the next 02 : 00 local time after that , the bits will be the same . Each change in the DST bits happens at 00 : 00 UTC and so will first be received in the mainland United States between 16 : 00 ( PST ) and 20 : 00 ( EDT ) , depending on local time zone and on whether DST is about to begin or end . A receiver in the Eastern time zone ( UTC \u2212 5 ) must therefore correctly receive the \" DST is changing \" indication within the seven hours before DST begins , and six hours before DST ends , if it is to change the local time display at the correct time . Receivers in the Central , Mountain , and Pacific time zones have one , two , and three more hours of advance notice , respectively . During a leap second , a binary zero is transmitted in the time code ; in this case , the minute will not be preceded by a marker . = = = Levels of modulation = = = The once-per-second \" ticks \" and minute and hour tones are modulated onto the carrier signal at 100 percent , or 0 dBc . The time code and audio tones are modulated at 50 percent , or approximately \u2212 3 dBc , and the maximum modulation level for the voice recordings is 75 percent , or approximately \u2212 1.25 dBc . = = Transmission system = = WWV broadcasts its signal on five transmitters , one per frequency . The transmitters for 2.5 MHz and 20 MHz put out an ERP of 2.5 kW , while those for the other three frequencies use 10 kW of ERP . The experimental 25 MHz signal uses a sixth transmitter , with 2.5 kW of radiated power . Each transmitter is connected to a dedicated antenna , which has a height corresponding to approximately one-half of its signal 's wavelength , and the signal radiation patterns from each antenna are omnidirectional . The top half of each antenna tower contains a quarter-wavelength radiating element , and the bottom half uses nine guy wires , connected to the midpoint of the tower and sloped at one-to-one from the ground \u2014 with a length of <formula> \u2014 as additional radiating elements . = = Half-hourly station identification announcement = = WWV identifies itself twice each hour , at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour . The text of the identification is as follows : WWV accepts reception reports sent to the address mentioned in the station ID , and responds with QSL cards . = = Telephone service = = WWV 's time signal can also be accessed by telephone by calling + 1 ( 303 ) 499-7111 ( Boulder , Colorado ) . An equivalent time service operated by the U.S. Naval Observatory can be accessed by calling + 1 ( 202 ) 762-1401 ( Washington , D.C. ) . Telephone calls are limited to two minutes in length , and the signal is delayed by an average of 30 milliseconds .",

        "doc": "Kevin Clash = Kevin Jeffrey Clash ( born September 17 , 1960 ) is an American puppeteer whose characters include Elmo , Clifford , Benny Rabbit , and Hoots the Owl . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , and began performing for local TV children 's shows in his hometown of Baltimore , Maryland , as a teenager . In the early 1980s , he began working in Captain Kangaroo , and began performing in Sesame Street in 1984 . He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo , the character he became the most famous for , and became an executive producer and director for the show . Clash worked in various productions for the Muppets and Jim Henson Productions and in other projects . He resigned from Sesame Street in late 2012 , after allegations of sexual impropriety , which he denied and were dismissed due to statute of limitations expiring . Clash wrote an autobiography , My Life as a Furry Red Monster , which was published in 2006 , and also featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = Early years = = Kevin Clash was born in Baltimore , Maryland , on September 17 , 1960 , the third of four children born to George Clash , a flash welder and handyman , and Gladys Clash , who ran a small daycare center in their two-bedroom , one-bath home in the Turner Station of Dundalk , Maryland . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , inspired by children 's shows like Kukla , Fran and Ollie and Sesame Street . He made his first puppet , a version of Mickey Mouse , at the age of 10 . When he was twelve , he created a monkey puppet out of the lining of his father 's coat . His first performances were for his mother 's daycare children . By the time he was a teenager , he had built almost 90 puppets , which he based upon commercials , popular music , and his friends . While still in high school , Clash performed at venues throughout Baltimore , including schools , churches , fundraisers , and community events . While appearing at a neighborhood festival , Clash was discovered by Baltimore television personality Stu Kerr , who became Clash 's first mentor and hired him to perform in the children 's show Caboose at Channel 2 . Clash also built puppets for the Romper Room franchise . When he was 17 , he contacted and met puppeteer Kermit Love , who became Clash 's mentor , after seeing Love featured in an episode of the documentary Call It Macaroni . In 1979 , on Love 's recommendation , Clash appeared as Cookie Monster in the Sesame Street float during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Parade , and met Jim Henson , who later became his boss , mentor , and friend . When he was nineteen , Clash became a puppeteer for Captain Kangaroo , initially as a guest performer , in which he also made occasional on-camera appearances . The producers of Captain Kangaroo used some of Clash 's puppet creations for the show . In 1984 , Clash had to turn down Henson 's offer to work on his film The Dark Crystal because he was working on two TV shows at the same time , Captain Kangaroo and Love 's syndicated program The Great Space Coaster , in which he was producer for the first time . = = Career = = Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons , and Great Space Coaster ended , freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street . Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983 , mostly performing nondescript , stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets . Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl ( based on Louis Armstrong ) , the infant Baby Natasha , and inventor Dr. Nobel Price . After 1985 , Elmo , a furry red monster , became his main character . Four puppeteers , including Richard Hunt , had performed Elmo previously , but it was Clash 's development , with a falsetto voice , that established the character . He based Elmo 's character on the preschool children that attended his mother 's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents . Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz , who told Clash to always \" find one special hook \" for each character . Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he \" should represent love \" . After the height of Elmo 's popularity , especially the \" Tickle Me Elmo \" craze in 1996 , Clash 's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased . He recruited , auditioned , and trained its puppeteers , and became the senior Muppet coordinator , a writer , director , and co-producer of the \" Elmo 's World \" segment of the show . Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street 's international co-productions . He found working with the co-productions \" a lot of fun \" and \" very rewarding \" . He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird . In 2007 , he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop . Until 2011 , he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances , making his schedule , as he called it , \" crazy \" . Cheryl Henson , president of the Jim Henson Foundation , called him \" essential \" to the show . Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , which was dedicated to Henson , in 1990 , voicing Master Splinter . He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions , including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour ( 1989 ) , and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz 's characters ( Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear , Sam the Eagle , and Animal ) in Muppet Treasure Island ( 1996 ) . Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space ( 1999 ) and The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz ( 2005 ) , and the TV series Muppets Tonight ( 1996 \u2014 1998 ) , in which he reprised Clifford , who served as the show 's host . He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs . In 1999 , Clash worked on a film starring Elmo , The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland . In 2006 , Clash published his autobiography , co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell , entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster : What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life , Love and Laughing Out Loud . His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = = Resignation from Sesame Workshop = = = In November 2012 , 23-year-old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Clash which began when Stephens was 16 . Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June , and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated . Clash acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser ; however , he characterized the relationship as being between consenting adults . Stephens later recanted his accusation , but two weeks later , another accuser , Cecil Singleton , made similar accusations and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Clash . Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20 , 2012 , and released a statement saying , \" Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work ' Sesame Street ' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer . I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately . \" Sesame Workshop also released a statement : \" Unfortunately , the controversy surrounding Kevin 's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want , and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from ' Sesame Street . ' \" They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash 's understudy and would take over his roles on the show . In July 2013 , the three cases against Clash were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash 's alleged violations during the three years after each turned 21 . Clash 's lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life . Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling , alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse weren 't fully realized until 2012 . In April 2014 , the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals . Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations , Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash , but the case ultimately was dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had ended . = = Personal life = = Clash was married for 17 years , and has a daughter who was born in 1993 . In November 2012 , Clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from the Sesame Workshop , stating , \" I am a gay man . I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter . \" Clash is African American and has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo , African-American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him . He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work , and that it came through in his performances . = = Awards and honors = = Clash won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in a Children 's Series for his work as Elmo on Sesame Street in 1990 , 2005 \u2013 2007 and 2009 \u2013 2013 . In all , he has won 27 daytime Emmys and one prime-time Emmy . He was the first recipient of the ' Miss Jean ' Worthley Award for Service to Families and Children given by Maryland Public Television on June 9 , 2007 . On May 19 , 2012 , Clash was presented with an honorary degree from Washington & Jefferson College .",

After graduating from Cambridge University in 1987 and working in advertising for three years , Langan joined Granada Television 's drama serials department where she script edited daytime soap operas . From there , she transferred to Granada 's newly created comedy department , where she developed the acclaimed television series Cold Feet , and other one-off comedies . In 2000 , she left Granada to become a freelance producer , and produced the romantic comedy series Rescue Me for the BBC . She returned to Granada in 2002 , where she produced the acclaimed dramas The Deal ( 2003 ) and Dirty Filthy Love ( 2004 ) . She made her feature film production debut on Pierrepoint ( 2005 ) , which got her a Carl Foreman Award nomination at the 60th British Academy Film Awards . Langan also produced The Queen ( 2006 ) for Granada , which won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . In 2006 , Langan became an executive producer at BBC Films , developing features such as The Other Boleyn Girl ( 2008 ) and The Duchess ( 2008 ) . In April 2009 , she was appointed Creative Director of BBC Films , giving her control of a \u00a3 12 million annual budget and which projects are commissioned for development . By 2010 , Langan had led BBC Films to a record 13 nominations at the British Academy Film Awards , which included In the Loop ( 2009 ) , Fish Tank ( 2009 ) and An Education ( 2009 ) . Langan lives in London with her partner , writer Christian Spurrier , and their two children . = = Background = = Christine Langan was born in January 1965 in Edmonton , London , England . Her mother and father , a dinner lady and a bricklayer respectively , already had three children . Growing up , Langan became interested in television production after seeing Lew Grade 's name in the credits of several programmes . She attended a Catholic grammar school and read English at Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge . After graduating from Cambridge University in 1987 , Langan spent three years working as a copywriter for an advertising company . She also contributed film reviews to BBC Radio 2 's Cinema 2 programme . In 1990 , Langan began her career in film production as an assistant developer for Tessa Ross at British Screen . The following year , she responded to an advertisement for a script editor at Granada Television 's drama serials department , located in Manchester . She was hired by David Liddiment , and worked mainly on Granada 's daytime soap operas . = = Career = = = = = Granada comedy = = = In 1993 , Langan returned to London to work for Andy Harries at Granada 's newly created comedy department , where she script-edited September Song , the television adaptation of An Evening with Gary Lineker , and the second series of Rik Mayall Presents . In 1995 , she was associate producer on The Perfect Match , a one-off comedy drama written by former BBC radio producer Mike Bullen . The Perfect Match was broadcast in September 1995 , and shortly afterwards , Harries asked Langan to develop more ideas from Bullen . They devised Cold Feet , another one-off comedy drama based on the love lives of Bullen himself and his friends . Langan produced Cold Feet , guiding Bullen through his script drafts , and hiring Father Ted director Declan Lowney to shoot it . Cold Feet was broadcast in March 1997 as one of four Comedy Premieres on ITV ( two others of which Langan script edited ) . It received poor ratings and little critical reaction . However , in May 1997 , it won the Rose d 'Or at the Montreux International Television Festival . ITV Network Centre commissioned a series of Cold Feet in August , which Langan also produced . For the series , Langan tried to achieve a written and visual style that differed from regular sitcoms by avoiding \" one-liners and quick laughs \" and hiring directors who had done little television work before . Cold Feet premiered as a series in November 1998 , and Langan stayed until the third series in 2000 . She and Bullen received a nomination for the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2000 . Also in 1998 , Langan worked on her first feature film , script editing the Parker Posey-led The Misadventures of Margaret . In 1999 , Langan was made an executive producer in the department . She oversaw several productions , including Passion Killers ( 1999 , starring Ben Miller ) , Safe as Houses ( 2000 , starring Ricky Tomlinson ) , and the pilot episode of David Nicholls ' I Saw You ( 2000 , starring Paul Rhys and Fay Ripley ) . In 2000 , Langan was offered a position at the BBC 's drama department , which had been rearranged that year . The trade magazine Broadcast reported the BBC had made a \" substantial offer \" to her . Granada 's director of programmes Grant Mansfield countered the BBC 's bid by offering Langan the position of deputy controller of drama , operating under Andy Harries , who had recently been appointed controller of the same department . Langan accepted neither offer , and instead became a freelance producer after her contract with Granada expired . As a freelancer , Langan developed three more episodes of I Saw You for Granada . Her only other project was producing David Nicholls ' romantic comedy series Rescue Me with Tiger Aspect Productions for BBC One . As well as producing it , she made her credited directorial debut on the final episode . The six-part series , starring Sally Phillips , was broadcast in 2002 . It was not a ratings success , and the BBC did not commission a second series . = = = Granada drama = = = In September 2002 , Langan signed a new contract to develop new projects at Granada 's combined drama , film and comedy department . Her first production was the romantic comedy television film Watermelon , starring Anna Friel . At the end of 2002 , she began developing Peter Morgan 's The Deal , a dramatisation of the political rise of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . Although initially giving full backing , the ITV network backed out during pre-production . Channel 4 picked up the film from Granada , and it was broadcast in September 2003 . The Deal was presented with the British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama in 2004 . The same year , she produced the one-off drama Dirty Filthy Love , which was also nominated for the BAFTA for Best Single Drama . In 2005 , Langan 's feature debut Pierrepoint was released at major film festivals . Based on the life of British hangman Albert Pierrepoint ( played by Timothy Spall ) , Pierrepoint got Langan a nomination for the Carl Foreman Award for Most Promising Newcomer at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007 . 2006 saw the theatrical release of The Queen , a feature film follow-up to The Deal , that focused on the impact the death of Diana , Princess of Wales had on Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II . Michael Sheen reprised his role as Tony Blair from The Deal , and Helen Mirren played Elizabeth . The film was produced by Granada in co-operation with the ITV network , and was released in late 2006 to critical acclaim . In 2007 , it won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . Of Langan 's work on Pierrepoint and The Queen , a Variety writer said , \" both pics are a tribute to her tactful skill at working with tricky but talented writers and directors to take stories that could easily have been confined to the small screen and give them real cinematic depth and breadth \" . = = = BBC Films = = = In September 2006 , Langan made a low-key departure from Granada to take up a position as an executive producer with BBC Films . Although approached to join BBC Films some years before , only in 2007 did she feel it was the time to \" concentrate more exclusively on film \" . She immediately began overseeing editing work on The Other Boleyn Girl , which was already in post-production . She also began developing The Damned United , a film based on David Peace 's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United A.F.C. in 1974 . The film was adapted by Peter Morgan , executive produced by Andy Harries , and starred Michael Sheen as Clough . On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects , Langan said , \" The reason I return to working with the same people is that you have invested time , energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends \u2014 The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends \" . Following David M. Thompson 's announcement that he would be retiring from the post of head of BBC Films in September 2007 , Langan was widely expected to take over his duties . Confirmation was made the following month when she was appointed Commissioning Editor of the company , taking over the day-to-day duties of BBC Films and reporting to Jane Tranter , the Controller of Fiction at the BBC . When Tranter transferred to a BBC Worldwide position in Los Angeles in 2009 , the BBC decided not to fill the Controller of Fiction vacancy with a single person . Instead , the responsibilities were divided between four people ; Langan became Creative Director of BBC Films , responsible for \" editorial strategy and commissioning \" , and also joined the BBC Fiction board . By 2010 , Langan was overseeing a \u00a3 12 million annual budget at BBC Films , and had executive produced high-profile films such as In the Loop ( Armando Iannucci , 2009 ) , Fish Tank ( Andrea Arnold , 2009 ) , and An Education ( Lone Scherfig , 2009 ) . BBC Films received 13 nomination at the 63rd British Academy Film Awards , described in the London Evening Standard as a record number . In 2010 , Langan also executive produced The Special Relationship \u2014 the final part of Peter Morgan 's \" Blair trilogy \" \u2014 and StreetDance , the first British feature film to be made in 3D . The Guardian recognised Langan 's achievements at BBC Films by ranking her at number 36 in its inaugural Film Power 100 list in September 2010 . Through 2011 , Langan executive produced Ralph Fiennes ' directorial debut Coriolanus , the Marilyn Monroe biopic My Week with Marilyn , and Lynne Ramsay 's adaptation of Lionel Shriver 's novel We Need to Talk About Kevin . The project was in development hell since 2007 until Langan realised BBC Films was trying to get too big a budget to make it with .

        "doc": "Gabriel Slaughter = Gabriel Slaughter ( December 12 , 1767 \u2013 September 19 , 1830 ) was the seventh Governor of Kentucky and was the first person to ascend to that office upon the death of the sitting governor . His family moved to Kentucky from Virginia when he was very young . He became a member of the Kentucky militia , serving throughout his political career . He received a citation from the state legislature in recognition of his service at the Battle of New Orleans . After spending a decade in the state legislature , Slaughter was elected the fourth Lieutenant Governor , serving under Charles Scott . With the War of 1812 looming at the end of his tenure , Slaughter ran for governor against Isaac Shelby , the state 's first governor and a noted military leader . Shelby beat Slaughter soundly . Four years later , Slaughter was again elected as lieutenant governor , serving under George Madison . Madison died a short time into his term , whereupon Slaughter became acting governor . He sought to be sworn in as governor , but public sentiment turned against him when he replaced Shelby 's son-in-law with John Pope as Secretary of State . Pope was an unpopular figure in Kentucky and , after his appointment , some in the General Assembly began to call for a special election to replace Slaughter . The measure did not pass , but Slaughter was never able to shed the title of \" acting governor . \" Following his term as governor , Slaughter became a Baptist lay minister and served on the first board of trustees of Georgetown College . He died September 19 , 1830 and was buried in his family 's cemetery . = = Early life = = Gabriel Slaughter was born in Culpeper County , Virginia on December 12 , 1767 , the son of Robert and Susannah ( Harrison ) Slaughter . He was educated in the county 's public schools and worked as a farmer . In 1786 , Slaughter married a cousin , Sarah Slaughter , and the couple had two daughters \u2013 Mary Buckner Slaughter and Susan Harrison Slaughter . Slaughter 's father visited Kentucky as early as 1776 , and moved to Mercer County permanently in 1789 . In September 1791 , Gabriel Slaughter sold his land in Virginia , and he and his family followed his father to Kentucky . He became known for his generosity , and his large mansion on the turnpike to Lexington was nicknamed \" Wayfarer 's Rest \" because of the vast number of travelers that he allowed to stay there . Among his guests was future lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee . Soon after his arrival in Kentucky , however , his wife Sarah died , leaving Slaughter to care for his two daughters alone . In 1795 , Slaughter was appointed justice of the peace in Mercer County by Governor Isaac Shelby . The same year , he was also named a tax commissioner for a district of Mercer County . On a return trip to Virginia in 1797 , Slaughter married his second wife , Sara Hord . The couple returned to Slaughter 's home in Mercer County , where they had three children : John Hord Slaughter , Frances Ann Hord Slaughter , and Felix Grundy Slaughter . = = Service in the Kentucky General Assembly = = Slaughter 's political career began in earnest with his 1797 election to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Mercer County . He was named to the Committee on Enrollments , and probably served as chair , since he delivered the committee 's reports to the Assembly . It is unclear whether he did not seek re-election in 1798 , or whether he was defeated in that year 's canvass . Whatever the case , he filled the space of his legislative hiatus by serving as trustee of the newly incorporated Harrodsburg Academy . He was re-elected to the state House in 1799 . In addition to the Committee on Enrollments , he served on the Committee on Privileges and Elections and a joint committee that reported on the state of the Auditor 's , Treasurer 's , and Registrar 's offices . Records show that he also served as chairman when the House sat as a committee of the whole on November 25 , 1799 . Slaughter was re-elected to the state House in 1800 , and from 1801 to 1808 he served in the Kentucky Senate . In 1801 , he was chosen as one of three commissioners from Mercer County charged with selling stock shares in the Kentucky River Company , which was chartered to clear obstructions in the Kentucky River from its mouth to the mouth of its south fork . In 1804 , he was a candidate for President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate following the death of the Senate 's presiding officer , Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell . Ultimately , however , Thomas Posey proved the more popular choice . From 1807 to 1808 , he served as chair of the Senate Committee of Propositions and Grievances . Slaughter was elected lieutenant governor in 1808 . In a four-man race , he received more than three times the number of votes as his nearest opponent . His four-year term under Governor Charles Scott was largely undistinguished . Although the exact date is unknown , it is likely that the death of Slaughter 's second wife preceded his election as lieutenant governor . On October 3 , 1811 , he married his third wife , Elizabeth ( Thompson ) Rodes , a widow from Scott County . Prohibited by the Kentucky Constitution from succeeding himself as lieutenant governor , Slaughter ran for governor of Kentucky in 1812 . The impending war with England , however , drew military hero and former governor Isaac Shelby into the race . Despite Shelby 's immense popularity , Slaughter refused to withdraw from the race and was soundly beaten by more than a two-to-one margin . Following his defeat , Slaughter took a two-year hiatus from public life , and engaged in farming at his estate in Mercer County . = = Service in the state militia = = Slaughter had been commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Regiment of the Kentucky militia on December 24 , 1803 . He was promoted to the rank of major in 1802 and colonel in 1803 . In 1814 , he answered Governor Shelby 's call for volunteers to serve in the army of the Southwest under General Andrew Jackson . When the Quartermaster general did not deliver promised supplies to Slaughter 's regiment , private funds had to be used to purchase boats for their travel down the Mississippi River . They also ran short of weapons . Upon their arrival at New Orleans on January 4 , 1815 , General Jackson noted in his official report that \" Not one man in ten was well armed , and only one man in three had any arms at all . \" The citizens of New Orleans provided enough firearms to equip the rest of Slaughter 's men and another Kentucky battalion . Despite being vastly outnumbered , Jackson 's forces were victorious . Units from Kentucky and Tennessee , including Slaughter 's regiment , bore the brunt of the British attack . Slaughter was later recognized by the state legislature for his service . Following their service together , Jackson asked Slaughter to preside over a court martial . When the verdict was not satisfactory to Jackson , he ordered Slaughter to reconsider and reverse the decision . Slaughter declined , replying \" I know my duty , and have performed it . \" This decision was respected by Jackson , and apparently did no harm to the mutual respect between him and Slaughter . = = Ascension to the governorship = = In 1816 , Slaughter was again elected to the post of lieutenant governor over Richard Hickman and James Garrard . George Madison was elected governor without opposition . Madison died October 14 , 1816 , and Slaughter ascended to the governorship . This was the first time a sitting governor had died in office in Kentucky , and some questioned the legality of Slaughter 's status in the position . Following Governor Madison 's death , Secretary of State Charles Stewart Todd offered to step down if Slaughter preferred to appoint someone else to the post . The letter was not an explicit resignation , as Todd emphatically declared his intention to work with Slaughter should the governor choose to retain him . Slaughter did replace Todd with former Senator John Pope , however , apparently as a political favor . This move proved disastrous for Slaughter 's political career . Todd was very popular by virtue of being the son-in-law of twice-governor Shelby . By contrast , Pope was extremely unpopular for his vote in the U.S. Senate against declaring war in the War of 1812 . The move was panned in the state 's newspapers , and by prominent citizens such as future governor James Turner Morehead . Yet Slaughter followed up with another unpopular decision , appointing Martin D. Hardin , a member of the hated Federalist Party , to fill the Senate seat of William T. Barry . Despite this , the General Assembly made the appointment permanent when it convened in December 1816 . However , the administration candidate for a full senatorial term , John Adair was defeated in the General Assembly , which opted for John J. Crittenden . On January 27 , 1817 , a faction in the Kentucky House of Representatives led by Joseph Cabell Breckinridge proposed a bill calling for the election of \" a governor to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of \" Governor Madison . The measure failed , but the legislative elections of 1817 showed a popular mandate for a special gubernatorial election . The Kentucky House passed a bill calling for such elections by a vote of 56 \u2013 30 , but the measure died in the state senate . Nevertheless , Slaughter was never officially given the title of governor and was referred to as \" lieutenant governor \" or \" acting governor \" throughout his administration . The General Assembly censured both Slaughter and Pope for failing to require the proper security and oath of office for the state treasurer . Slaughter 's unpopularity led to the demise of many of his proposals , regardless of their merits . He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and , though the idea had been proposed by previous governors , Slaughter devised a means of funding it . The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter 's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries . Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements , including the creation of a state library . These measures were also rejected . Slaughter 's governorship was further complicated by the financial panic of 1819 , and he spent the majority of his term working to stabilize that state 's economy . Politicians of the day generally divided into those who favored measures favorable to debtors \u2013 called the \" relief \" position or party \u2013 and those who insisted that creditors be paid in a timely manner \u2013 called the \" anti-relief \" position or party . On December 16 , 1819 , the General Assembly passed a law requiring a six-month moratorium on the collection of debts . Slaughter , an anti-relief partisan , vetoed the bill , but relief party legislators held a large majority in the General Assembly thanks to the previous fall 's elections , and overrode the veto . The following February , the General Assembly passed an even more liberal stay law , preventing the collection of debts for one year if the creditor would accept payments in the devalued notes of the Bank of Kentucky and two years if they demanded payment in specie or specie-backed notes . These actions were a precursor to the Old Court-New Court controversy . While Slaughter clashed with the General Assembly over potential solutions to the crisis at the state level , he adopted a strong states ' rights policy at the national level . He challenged the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States and the Supreme Court 's ruling that individual states could not tax branches of the Bank . = = Religious leadership and later life = = Following his term as governor , Slaughter failed in a bid to return to the state senate in 1821 , but was re-elected to the state House of Representatives in 1823 , serving a single term . During this term , he continued to support measures to improve education . He voted to ask Congress for aid for the Deaf and Dumb School in the state , and opposed redirecting fines and forfeitures earmarked for the state 's \" Seminaries of Learning \" into the state treasury . He was also named to a joint committee to investigate the use of state appropriations to Transylvania University .

        "doc": "Big Four ( tennis ) = In tennis , the term Big Four refers to the quartet of men 's singles players Roger Federer , Rafael Nadal , Novak Djokovic , and Andy Murray . They reigned as the four best players in the world every season from 2008 \u2013 2016 . These players were considered dominant in terms of ranking and tournament victories , including Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters 1000 events , as well as the ATP World Tour Finals and Olympic Games . Federer was the first to come to prominence after winning Wimbledon in 2003 and established himself as the world No. 1 by the beginning of 2004 . Nadal followed in 2005 after a French Open triumph including a win over Federer , and they occupied the top two places in the ATP rankings for 211 consecutive weeks from July 2005 to August 2009 . Djokovic , from 2007 , and later Murray , from 2009 , increasingly challenged Federer 's and Nadal 's dominance with seasonal consistency : Djokovic captured three of the four major tournaments in 2011 , and in 2012 the quartet won one Major tournament apiece . In 2011 , Nadal declared that his and Federer 's period of joint dominance had ended , owing to the ascent of other players , notably Djokovic and Murray . Since this time the term \" Big Four \" , while used previously , became popular with the media and in tennis literature . The Big Four were a critical part of what has , since 2010 , often been labelled a new \" Golden Era \" in tennis ; that term is also applied to the mid-1970s to 1980s , and the 1920s to the 1930s . Between them , they have won 42 of the last 46 men 's major singles titles , from the 2005 French Open through to the 2016 Wimbledon Championships ( the only times they haven 't won being at the 2009 US Open , the 2014 Australian Open , the 2014 US Open and the 2015 French Open ) ; they have also won 11 of the previous 13 World Tour Finals ( previously Tennis Masters Cup ) , with Federer winning six and Djokovic winning five , with a record 4 consecutive from 2012 to 2015 . They have regularly occupied the top four places in the year-end rankings between 2008 and 2013 , with Murray being the only member not to have been ranked world No. 1 , having reached a career high No. 2 on several occasions . Of the four , Federer leads with a record 17 Grand Slam tournament titles followed by Nadal ( 14 ) , Djokovic ( 12 ) and Murray ( 3 ) . Federer , Nadal , and Djokovic have completed a Career Grand Slam by winning each of the four Majors at least once , with Nadal also winning a gold medal at 2008 Summer Olympics for a Career Golden Slam . Murray has won neither the French Open nor the Australian Open , despite reaching the final five times in Melbourne and once in Paris , but won the gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Furthermore , at ATP Masters 1000 tournaments , they are all in historic top 10 list , Djokovic leads with a record 29 titles , Nadal ( 28 ) , Federer ( 24 ) , and Murray ( 12 ) . All four players have also played key roles in leading their countries to success in the Davis Cup , including in Djokovic 's and Federer 's case with Serbia ( 2010 ) and Switzerland ( 2014 ) winning the competition for the first time , while Nadal has racked up four Davis Cup titles , and in Murray 's case , ending a drought of 79 years for Great Britain in 2015 . = = History = = = = = Before 2008 = = = = = = = Big two : Federer and Nadal = = = = The early 2000s were seen as a time of transition in tennis , with older players retiring and a few players breaking through at the very top of the game . Roger Federer had first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998 , finishing his first full ATP season the following year before finishing 2002 ranked sixth in the world , his first year-end ranking in the top 8 . His breakthrough came in 2003 when he won his first Grand Slam tournament , and finished the year as world number 2 behind Andy Roddick . The following two years he had almost complete solo dominance , winning five of eight majors and losing just ten matches in 2004 and 2005 . Nadal had won his first ATP Tour match aged 15 years and 10 months in April 2002 , and he defeated Federer in their first meeting in 2004 at Miami . 2005 was Nadal 's breakthrough year , in which he won 24 consecutive matches on clay , including his first French Open beating Federer en route in the semifinals , and he finished as world number 2 while Federer remained number 1 for a second straight year . The period between 2005 and 2008 was subsequently dominated by the Federer \u2013 Nadal rivalry . They won 11 consecutive majors , meeting in every French Open and Wimbledon final from 2006 \u2013 2008 . The 2008 Wimbledon final , which Nadal won , has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts . From 2005 \u2013 2010 they ended every year as the world 's top two players . = = = = Djokovic and Murray = = = = Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were born a week apart , played each other as juniors and made their Grand Slam tournament debuts in 2005 . Djokovic made his ATP tour debut in 2004 , while Murray 's was in 2005 , a time when many bright youngsters joined the ATP tour . They both reached the world top 100 in 2005 , and the world top 20 in 2006 . Djokovic , however , began to excel ahead of Murray , reaching one major final and two semifinals in 2007 and began to challenge Federer and Nadal regularly . He also won two Masters tournament titles and 5 titles in total , finishing the year ranked number 3 in world . Murray , who was forced out of the French Open and Wimbledon by injury , ended 2007 ranked 11th , winning two ATP tournaments . = = = 2008 \u2013 2010 : Emergence of the Big Four = = = Between 2008 and 2010 , Novak Djokovic and later Andy Murray attempted to end the duopoly of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the summit of tennis . They did not break it but emerged ahead of the rest of the tour . At the 2008 Australian Open , Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the semifinals , reaching his first Australian Open final and ending Federer 's streak of ten consecutive Major finals , continuing his fine form at the end of the 2007 season which saw him reach his first major final . Djokovic went on to defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ( who had eliminated Nadal in the semifinal ) to win his first Major . Following his Australian Open win , Djokovic emerged as a clear world number three during the year , holding the ranking throughout 2008 . Meanwhile , Andy Murray continued to rise in the rankings , reaching his first Major quarterfinal at Wimbledon , losing to Nadal . He also won his first two Masters titles . Federer and Nadal remained the lead rivalry , and the pair met in the final of both the French Open and Wimbledon . Nadal won both , with the latter described as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time . In August 2008 , after winning the 2008 Summer Olympics gold medal , Nadal passed Federer to become world No. 1 , after Federer had been at the top for a record 237 consecutive weeks . The year 's final Major , the US Open , saw all four players reach the semifinals of the same Major for the first time . Federer defeated Djokovic in the semifinals , while Murray won through to his first Grand Slam tournament final after upsetting the top-ranked Nadal in four sets . Federer then defeated Murray in the final to win his fifth consecutive US Open title , and win his 13th Major title overall . Following the US Open , Murray entered the top four in the ATP rankings for the first time and all four players qualified for the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup , which Djokovic won . Despite having to withdraw from this event through injury , Nadal ended the year ranked world No. 1 , ahead of Federer and Djokovic with Murray respectively finishing fourth due to his run at the US Open . In 2009 , the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for a whole calendar year for the first time . This also prompted the first uses of the term ' Big Four ' to refer to the players , although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray who they themselves were still regarded ahead of the rest of the tour . At the Australian Open , Nadal won his first Australian Open title in another 5-set epic , obtaining a third consecutive Major final victory over Federer , while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier on . Nadal continued to dominate early in the season , but suffered from injury in June , allowing Federer to take the upper hand for the rest of the season . Federer subsequently passed the record for most Grand Slam tournament wins , taking his 14th Grand Slam title at the French Open , thus completing the Career Grand Slam after Nadal had prevented him from achieving this feat at the previous 4 French Open tournaments , and 15th title at Wimbledon respectively . Federer finished the season having reached all four Major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007 . Following Nadal 's injuries , Murray and Djokovic made up further grounds in the rankings , although neither of them were able to make a Major final in 2009 . In particular , their consistency at Masters level tournaments kept them in the top four of the rankings , with Murray reaching world No. 2 in August , and ending the 211-week reign of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the top two players of the world in the process . His reign as the world No. 2 would not last long , as he was upset in the fourth round of the US Open by Croat Marin \u010cili\u0107 . There , Djokovic reached his first Grand Slam tournament semifinal of 2009 , losing in straight sets to Federer while Nadal was defeated by eventual winner Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the semifinal . Between 2005 Australian Open and 2014 Australian Open , this was the only Grand Slam event not won by a member of the Big Four . ( Since then , Wawrinka won the 2014 Australian Open and 2015 French Open while \u010cili\u0107 won the 2014 US Open ) . At the end of 2009 Federer , Nadal , Djokovic and Murray finished as the ATP 's top four players for the second consecutive year with only Nadal and Federer changing positions from the 2008 final rankings list . During the 2010 season , the Big Four began to dominate the Tour as a group for the first time . The Big Four provided six of the eight Grand Slam tournament finalists , and won 14 tournaments combined in the season ( compared to 6 for the other four competitors at the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals ) . At the start of the year , Federer continued his dominance as world number one by winning the Australian Open , defeating Murray in the final however his run of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals came to end at the French Open that year losing to Robin S\u00f6derling in 4 sets , he also then lost to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych at Wimbledon ending his run of 7 consecutive Wimbledon finals . Nadal dominated the clay-court season again , winning all three clay-court Masters events and the French Open . Nadal also won at Wimbledon , although in both of these tournaments he only had to face one other member of the Big Four ( Murray in the Wimbledon semi-finals ) . At the US Open , Djokovic beat Federer to reach his third Major final , although Nadal won once again to complete his Career Grand Slam . In November , Robin S\u00f6derling ( who has reached the French Open final ) briefly passed Murray to reach fourth place in the ATP rankings , threatening to break the Big Four 's run of filling the end-of-year rankings . However , all of the Big Four reached the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals semifinals with Federer defeating Nadal in 3 sets in the final , leading to them achieving their third successive season in the top 4 positions . Again Djokovic and Murray were third and fourth respectively , both reaching one Grand Slam tournament final apiece . = = = 2011 to 2013 : Dominance = = = The 2011 season was dominated by Novak Djokovic . Djokovic won 10 titles in total , including three Grand Slam tournament titles ( only the fifth man in the open era to do so ) and five ATP Masters 1000 titles ( a record ) , enjoyed a 41 match winning streak ( ended by Federer in the semifinals of the 2011 French Open ) , amassed a record in prize money , and ascended to world No. 1 in the world for the first time in July . The season was described by many experts and former players as one of the best tennis seasons for a single player seen in history , with Tennis Magazine describing it as the third best tennis season ever , behind Roger Federer 's 2006 season , and Rod Laver 's in 1969 . Pete Sampras described it as \" one of the best achievements in all of sport . \" Djokovic 's dominance contributed to an overall control by the Big Four . They all reached the semifinals at two of the year 's Grand Slam events , and between them won every Masters tournament . Nadal was a clear second place behind Djokovic , winning the French Open and losing in both the Wimbledon and US Open final . Nadal ended the season with a 0 \u2013 6 losing record against Djokovic : every match they played was a championship final . By his standards , Roger Federer had a weak season : he failed to win a Grand Slam tournament title for the first time since 2002 , losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final , and the sixth time overall in Major finals . He dropped to world No. 4 in November , the first time he had been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002 . Federer 's drop was caused by Murray 's remarkable run of form in Asia in October , winning three successive titles . However , Federer rallied , winning his three final tournaments ( a sign of things to come in the subsequent season ) , including the World Tour Finals , which was enough to secure an end-of-season ranking of No. 3 . Murray , meanwhile , was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments , with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final by Djokovic . He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year , and five titles in total . The dominance of the Big Four continued in 2012 . Each player won one Grand Slam tournament : Djokovic won in Australia , Nadal in France , Federer at Wimbledon and Murray ( who hired former world number 1 Ivan Lendl as his head coach earlier in the year ) with his first Grand Slam tournament title at the US Open . This win \" cemented \" Murray 's position \u2013 who also won gold in the Olympic Games \u2013 as a member of the Big Four : his end of season ranking of third was his best yet . Djokovic entered the season as world number 1 , and remained there until July 2012 , when he was overtaken by Federer , who reclaimed the top spot for the first time since June 2010 . Federer subsequently overtook Sampras ' record of 286 weeks at the top , and ultimately extended the record to 302 weeks . Federer relinquished his world No. 1 ranking on 5 November , Djokovic reclaiming the top spot and ending the year at the top of the rankings for the second consecutive year . Djokovic was the only player to make at least the semifinals in all four Grand Slam events , and was the losing finalist at the French and US Open . Both he and Federer won three Masters tournaments , seeing them dominate the season as a whole . Federer was also the silver medalist at the Olympics , where Djokovic finished fourth . Nadal , meanwhile , had his season cut short by an injury . Having won two clay court Masters tournaments and the French Open , he was eliminated in the second round at Wimbledon \u2013 his first defeat at such an early stage in a Grand Slam tournament since 2005 . He later revealed that he had been injured going into the tournament , and he did not compete for the rest of the season , but still ended the year as world No. 4 . The 2013 season continued in similar fashion , with Djokovic , Federer and Murray occupying three of the four semifinal slots at the Australian Open , with Nadal still suffering from injury . Murray beat Federer in a five-set epic in the semifinal meaning all four members of the Big Four had beaten each other at least once in a Grand Slam event , subsequently losing to Djokovic in the final in four sets . As a result , Djokovic became the third man to win four Australian Open titles and the first to win three consecutively . Murray himself becoming the first man to reach the final of the next Grand Slam event after winning their maiden title . Nadal returned for the clay-court season , winning events in Rome , Barcelona , Madrid before becoming the only male player to win a Grand Slam tournament eight times by winning the French Open , defeating Djokovic in the semifinals . However , Djokovic did end Nadal 's eight-year winning streak at the Monte-Carlo Masters . Murray 's clay-court season ended prematurely because of a back injury and did not compete at the French Open , whereas Federer lost in the quarterfinals after making the final in Rome . Nadal and Federer lost early at Wimbledon in the first and second round respectively , thus ending Federer 's 36 consecutive Grand Slam tournament quarter final appearance record . Murray defeated Djokovic in the final to become the first British man to win the tournament in 77 years , extending his winning streak on grass to 18 matches . Leading up to the US Open , Nadal won ATP Masters 1000 events in Montreal and Cincinnati , his third hardcourt ATP Masters 1000 event of the year after winning at Indian Wells earlier in the year , extending his winning streak to 15 \u2013 0 on hardcourts for the year . He went on to win the US Open , defeating Djokovic in the final in four sets . While Murray and Federer lost early , in the quarterfinals and fourth round respectively . Overall , the season was about Nadal and Djokovic . Nadal won two Majors and five ATP Masters 1000 events . He was also runner-up at the ATP World Tour Finals . Djokovic won one Major , and reached two finals and a semifinal in the other three , and finished the year strongly on a 22-match winning streak , winning the ATP World Tour Finals in London . The 2013 head-to-head record of Nadal and Djokovic was tied at 3 \u2013 3 . A back injury ended Murray 's season prematurely and he finished fourth in the rankings , but was the only player besides Nadal and Djokovic to win a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 title , at Wimbledon and Miami respectively . Federer suffered his worst season for a decade . He reached just one Major semifinal , failed to win a single ATP Masters 1000 crown and finished the year sixth in the rankings with one title to his name , though he too suffered from a recurring back injury throughout the season . = = = 2014 and beyond : Djokovic 's dominance = = = As 2013 came to a close , Roger Federer 's fall in the rankings prompted many sources to debate whether or not the status of the Big Four had ended . This debate intensified in the wake of the Australian Open , which saw Stan Wawrinka defeat Djokovic in the quarter-final and Nadal in the final to win his first Slam title , marking just the second time since 2005 and the first since 2009 that a player outside the Big Four had won a Grand Slam tournament . Murray and Federer fell to sixth and eighth in the rankings respectively , and after the tournament , several players expressed the opinion that they were now capable of challenging the Big Four . However , the Big Four occupied all four final spots of the first two Masters 1000 titles of the year in Indian Wells and Miami , with Djokovic winning his fourth and fifth consecutive Masters titles with tight victories over Federer and Nadal respectively . The clay-court season started with Wawrinka winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Monte-Carlo , coming from behind to defeat Federer in the final . Nadal had failed to reach the final in Monte-Carlo for the first time since 2004 , and also lost his first match at Barcelona since 2003 , against Nicolas Almagro . A third loss , to Djokovic in the final of the Rome Masters , was the first time Nadal had lost more than two matches on clay in a season for a decade . He did , however , win the Madrid Masters , and went on to defend his French Open title , defeating Murray in the semi-final and Djokovic in the final , with Federer losing in the fourth round to Ernests Gulbis \u2013 the third time in his last four Grand Slam event appearances he failed to make the quarterfinals . Following his back surgery at the end of 2013 , Murray had struggled to return to form in the first half of the year , reaching only two semi-finals and losing to Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets in the quarter-finals while attempting to defend his Wimbledon title , a defeat which saw him fall to no . 10 in the world rankings . This , and Nadal 's loss to Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round , his third consecutive early-round loss at Wimbledon , led former players and experts , including Jimmy Connors , to express the opinion that the \" aura \" around the Big Four had faded . Milos Raonic , who reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon , suggested there was now a \" human side \" visible in the Big Four , which was giving players belief when facing them . However , Djokovic defeated Dimitrov and Federer beat Raonic to make it an all-Big Four final , the 24th they have contested . Djokovic defeated Federer in five sets to claim his second Wimbledon title , a result that left Djokovic , Nadal and Federer occupying the top three places in the rankings . At the Rogers Cup , Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Djokovic and Murray in the third round and quarter-finals respectively before defeating Federer in the final . Federer continued his return to form , winning his first Masters title since 2012 in Cincinnati . Later , he also won the Shanghai Masters , and returned to No. 2 in the rankings , overtaking Nadal , whose season had been curtailed by a wrist injury . The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four 's collective grip on the major titles slip still further , however , as Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic beat Djokovic and Federer in the semi-finals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 Australian Open , and the first time since 2003 that multiple first-time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season . Following the tournament , Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings , his first time outside the top 10 since 2008 . The tournament as a whole further signalled the decline of the Big Four 's dominance . Towards the end of the year , Andy Murray managed to return to form , winning three titles in Shenzhen , Vienna and Valencia , allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the Tour Finals , but he bowed out at the group stages following a humiliating defeat by Federer , in which he won just a single game . Indeed , throughout the year Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings . The 2014 season drew to a close with Djokovic winning the China Open title , extending his record at the event to 24 \u2013 0 , and the Paris Masters title . At the tour finals Federer and Djokovic both reached the final , but Federer withdrew citing injury following a brutal semifinal against Wawrinka . Federer recovered to win the Davis Cup as part of the Switzerland team for his , and the country 's , first triumph in the competition , leading many people to say that his tennis career was now complete . Collectively , the Big Four won 19 titles in 2014 , but two Slam titles and two Masters titles went to other players . In the end-of-year rankings , Djokovic , Federer and Nadal held the top three spots , with Murray in sixth . Following Murray 's strong end to 2014 and reaching the final of the 2015 Australian Open , he moved into the top four in the ATP rankings for the first time in over year , meaning that the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for the first time since early 2013 , slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet . However , Federer and Nadal both lost early in the third round and quarterfinals respectively , the first time in 12 appearances that Federer had lost before the semi-finals at the first Slam of the season . Djokovic won the title , as well as well as the first three Masters titles of the year in Indian Wells ( where the Big Four were the top four seeds in ATP Masters 1000 event for the time since 2012 ) , Miami and Monte-Carlo , defeating Murray in the final in Miami ( his seventh straight victory against the Brit ) and Federer in the final of Indian Wells respectively . With these victories , Djokovic became the only man to win the Indian Wells-Miami sweep on three separate occasions . Andy Murray 's strong form continued and on his return in the clay-court season he won his first title on a clay court in Munich . Then , in the Madrid Open , he defeated Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori to reach the final , where he defeated Nadal in straight sets to win his first Masters title on clay and first since 2013 . This was also the first time he had beaten another member of the Big Four in a Tour match since his victory in the final at Wimbledon 2013 , going into the match 0 \u2013 12 against the other members . The defeat saw Nadal slip to seventh in the rankings , his first time outside the Top 5 for more than a decade . Djokovic , returning after skipping Madrid , again defeated Federer in the final for his fourth Masters title of the year in Rome . Nadal suffered his worst European clay-court season in a decade , failing to win a single title and appearing in just one final , whereas Djokovic and Murray entered the second Grand Slam event of the year unbeaten on clay . Murray continued his clay court form during the French Open , defeating David Ferrer in the quarter-finals to set up a semifinal against Djokovic , who had defeated Nadal in straight sets in the opposing quarter . This was only Nadal 's second defeat at the French Open , seeing him drop to No. 10 in the rankings , while Federer had been knocked out by fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka in the quarter-final held the previous day . Djokovic emerged victorious over Murray in a five set match that was spread over two days but succumbed to Wawrinka in the final in four sets , Wawrinka 's second Slam title in two years . As the grass court season began , Nadal 's inconsistent form continued , as he won the title in Stuttgart before losing in the first round of Queen 's the following week and in the second round at the Wimbledon championships two weeks later . Murray went on to win Queen 's for a record-tying fourth time , whilst Federer went on to win an eighth title in Halle . They both reached the semifinals of Wimbledon with Federer emerging victorious over Murray in straight sets . Djokovic claimed the other spot in the final , seeing off Kevin Anderson in five sets in the fourth round along the way , to set up a rematch of the previous year 's final , and defeated Federer in four sets to win his second grand slam of the year , denying Federer a record eighth Wimbledon title for the second year in a row . Murray and Federer shared the two North American Hard Court Masters titles , at Montreal and Cincinnati respectively , with Djokovic being the losing finalist on both occasions . Murray 's victory over Djokovic in the Montreal final was his first in 2015 and followed eight successive losses against the Serb , and briefly saw him return to the No. 2 ranking , before Federer reclaimed the No. 2 position the following week , having defeated Murray in the semi-finals . Nadal meanwhile was defeated at the quarter-finals in Montreal and the third round in Cincinnati , and also suffered an early exit at the US Open . Murray was beaten by Kevin Anderson in the fourth round , his earliest defeat at a slam tournament since the 2010 US Open , but the final was contested by Djokovic and Federer . Djokovic won in four sets , giving him a third slam title of the season . Murray led Great Britain to Davis Cup victory in 2015 , winning all eight of a possible eight singles rubbers and becoming the latest member of the quartet to win the Davis Cup . = = = 2016 = = = In 2016 Djokovic collected his sixth Australian Open title in a straight sets victory over Murray . He followed up this solid run of form with a record setting fifth Indian Wells and record equaling sixth Miami masters titles . At the 2016 French Open , Djokovic again beat Murray in the final to become the third Big Four member after Federer and Nadal to complete a Career Grand Slam . Nadal withdrew from that year 's Wimbledon with a damaged wrist tendon , while a shock defeat for Novak Djokovic in the third round at the hands of the American Sam Querrey in four sets meant that only two of the Big Four were present in the tournament 's quarter-finals ; Federer and Murray . Federer lost his semifinal to Milos Raonic in five sets . In the final Murray beat Raonic in straight sets to win his second Wimbledon title , and third Grand Slam title overall . Murray 's victory marked the first time since the 2010 French Open that a member of the Big Four had won a Grand Slam title without having to defeat one of the other three members . Federer withdrew from the remainder of the 2016 season due to a knee injury , missing the 2016 Olympics and 2016 US Open . = = Overall dominance = = = = = Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympics = = = Since the 2005 Australian Open , the opening Grand Slam tournament of the 2005 ATP Tour , the Big Four have won both Olympic Games singles tournaments. all but four Majors , and all but two Tennis Masters Cups \/ ATP World Tour Finals . The dominance does not just consist of winning the events either , with all four members regularly making it to the latter stages of the tournament . Since 2010 they have occupied all but 4 finalist spots . Since 2008 they have occupied all four semifinal spots on four occasions , at the 2008 US Open , 2011 French Open , 2011 US Open & 2012 Australian Open , as well as taking three of the four spaces on nine other separate occasions . In 2011 they occupied 14 out of a possible 16 Grand Slam semifinal slots . In the same period , only twice have two or more not made the semifinal stage ( 2009 & 2010 French Open ) , while in 2012 they took 13 out 16 Grand Slam tournament semifinal slots . At the Olympics , members of the Big Four took two of the three available singles medals in 2008 and 2012 , and including doubles have a total of three golds , two silvers and a bronze from these games . Federer and Murray are the only members of the Big Four to have two Olympic medals , and Murray is the only one to have won two medals at the same tournament , taking both the singles ' gold medal and the mixed doubles ' silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Djokovic is the only member to not have won a gold medal in any event so far , having taken the singles ' bronze medal in 2008 . The Big Four , along with Rod Laver , Tony Roche and Ivan Lendl , are the only men in Open Era history to reach the semifinals at all four Majors in a single calendar year , Federer has achieved this a record 5 times in his career so far and Djokovic four times . However , this feat has been accomplished many more times in the pre-Open Era .

Djokovic leads with a record 29 titles followed by Nadal ( 28 ) , Federer ( 24 ) , and Murray ( 12 ) .

This includes all 9 in 2011 , 2013 and 2015 . Moreover , between the 2010 Paris Masters and 2012 Paris Masters , they won 17 consecutive ATP Masters 1000 events . As of the 2013 Rome Masters , they had won 109 titles from 121 finals at all levels of the ATP Tour since the start of the 2008 season . Since the tournaments were revamped and renamed ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events at the beginning of 2009 , no player outside the Big Four has won more than one title . Of these ATP Masters events , excluding the Paris Masters ( where the Big Four have had less success , although they have still won it five times in the last seven years ) they have won : All but one Indian Wells Masters events since ( and including ) 2004 .

Although no player has won each of these 15 events in men 's singles , this feat has been achieved in men 's doubles by Canada 's Daniel Nestor and the United States ' Bryan Brothers , Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan . Djokovic matches the result in men 's singles of Andre Agassi , who ended his career having won 13 of these 15 events , achieving a Career Grand Slam ( winning all four Majors in a career ) , a Career Golden Slam ( winning all four Majors and the Olympic singles gold medal in a career ) , and what Sports Illustrated called a Career Super Slam ( winning all four Majors , the Olympic singles gold medal , and the ATP World Tour Finals ) . Federer and Nadal are one behind Djokovic , and within three of matching this feat of winning all 15 . Nadal has also achieved a Career Grand Slam and a Career Golden Slam , but has thus far fallen short of winning the Tour Finals , and the Miami Open and Paris Masters . Federer has also achieved a Career Grand Slam , but is missing the Olympic Gold in singles , and the Monte-Carlo Masters and Italian Open . Djokovic , as the only man to have won eight of the nine Masters events , is just a Cincinnati title away from achieving what has been labelled the Career Golden Masters , as well as needing the Olympic Gold to complete his overall tally . Murray , for his part , is still only about two-thirds of the way to the goal having won 9 of the 15 events .

Collectively they have won 87 of these 99 tournaments ( 88 % ) . Of the 12 tournaments they failed to win , they were runner-up in 6 of them , and 5 of these 12 tournaments occurred prior to them first being seeded as the Top 4 players ( post-US Open 2008 ) .

As for tournaments where only one of the Big Four has competed , this is the only category where the rest of the field has a positive ratio , winning 186 of the 262 tournaments ( 71 % ) played overall . However , it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four 's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits . Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008 , the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments ( 52 % ) where just one of them has competed .

He held his spot at the top of the rankings for exactly a year before being surpassed by Roger Federer in June 2012 after he won his 7th Wimbledon title , and by doing so , equalled Pete Sampras 's record of 7 Wimbledon titles and also surpassed his record of total weeks at world No. 1 , extending his stay to a total of 302 weeks before Djokovic retained his ranking at the season 's end after winning the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals and then solidified his position by retaining his Australian Open title , winning it for a record-tying fourth time .

While the question of breaking through the dominance of the Big Four is a constant question the rest of the tour are constantly asked , many former top professionals have also spoken about the topic , including Bj\u00f6rn Borg , Andre Agassi , Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic . At the 2011 Wimbledon Championships , 11-time Major champion Bj\u00f6rn Borg was quoted as saying : = = = Media = = = Since 2010 , when the Big Four increasingly began to dominate the tour as a group , most articles and reports concentrate solely on the members of the Big Four and their chances in upcoming tournaments or how the previous one has affected them , with smaller sections on the rest of the players . = = = Wider impact on the sport = = = For the most part , the presence of the Big Four is generally seen to have had a positive impact on tennis , making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention . However , with all four members being from European countries , this may have had a potentially negative effect on interest in North America . It has also argued the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring . = = = Murray 's position = = = Some tennis commentators , including Murray himself , have spoken of a \" Big Three \" or \" Trivalry \" , with Murray behind the other three players . Between September 2008 and January 2013 , Murray was the only one of the Big Four to have dropped outside of the top four rankings on the ATP Tour and is the only one never to have been ranked world number one . Also , he has an overall record of 28-54 versus the Big Three . However , Murray has a total of twelve Masters 1000 titles , eleven career Major finals , including victories at the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon ( defeating Djokovic in both finals ) and 2016 Wimbledon ( defeating Raonic in final ) , won the 2012 Olympic Games , made 27 Major quarter-finals and 20 semi-finals , and has been ranked world No. 2 a total of 45 weeks dating back to 17 August 2009 . This has led to him being reported as \" definitely part of the Big Four \" since 2010 . However , after losing his Wimbledon title defence to Grigor Dimitrov in the 2014 quarter-finals , Murray dropped to No. 10 in the world rankings , making this the first time in six years that he had been ranked this low . This was the culmination of a poor twelve months in which he failed to reach a final , or register a top ten victory , following his Wimbledon triumph in 2013 , after recovering from major back surgery at the end of 2013 . Following a strong end to the 2014 season , Murray finally ranked back in the top four in February 2015 along with the rest of the Big Four for the first time since the start of 2013 , slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet . Meanwhile , Roger Federer , by reaching the final , which he lost to Novak Djokovic , returned to number three in the world rankings , marking this the first time in two years that the top three places on the ATP World Rankings were all occupied by Djokovic , Nadal and Federer simultaneously . = = = \" Big Five \" proposals = = = Popular propositions have claimed that tennis has a \" Big Five \" , with either Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro , Marin \u010cili\u0107 or Stanislas Wawrinka expanding the Big Four . The most accepted theory centres around Wawrinka , since he has won two Grand Slam championships . As of July 11 , 2016 , he has won more Grand Slam singles titles than any active player outside the Big Four since September 3 , 2006 , when Andre Agassi retired ( and has won as many Grand Slams as Lleyton Hewitt , who retired on July 4 , 2016 ) . From Roland Garros 2015 until Wimbledon 2016 , Wawrinka also had as many Grand Slam titles to his name as Andy Murray . A testament to Stan Wawrinka 's suggested Big Five status is the fact that he is one of only three players outside the Big Four to have won a Grand Slam event between the 2005 Australian Open and 2016 Wimbledon . He is also one of only three players to have beaten each of the Big Four at Grand Slam level . Furthermore he defeated the world # 1 and world # 2 at each of his two grand slam titles . At the 2014 Australian Open , he beat world # 2 Djokovic 9-7 in the fifth set of the quarter-finals and then triumphed over world # 1 Nadal in 4 sets in the final . Then at the 2015 French Open , he defeated world # 2 Federer in straight sets during the quarter-finals before prevailing against world # 1 Djokovic in the final after losing the first set . By virtue of this win over Djokovic , Wawrinka handed him his only loss in a Grand Slam in 2015 and it also thwarted Djokovic 's chances to complete the career grand slam . Although the Big Four is often compared to successful tennis quartets of the past , some proponents of the Big Five concept have suggested that the dominant quartets in question were really quintets . For example , when considering the era of Borg , Connors , McEnroe and Lendl , Guillermo Vilas also springs to mind . Similarly , Mats Wilander was an integral part of the era that comprised Sampras , Edberg , Becker and Agassi . In like manner , such pundits argue , Stanislas Wawrinka is a quintessential player of the Big Four 's generation . At the 2016 Australian Open , during Stanislas Wawrinka 's fourth round matchup with Milos Raonic , local commentator Bruce McAvaney made the comment : \" I suppose it 's a big five , with Stan having the two Slams . \" Ahead of the semifinal encounter between Murray and Wawrinka at the 2016 French Open however , Wawrinka dismissed the idea of a Big Five , describing Murray as \" well ahead \" of him : = = = Golden era = = = Some , including Steffi Graf and John McEnroe , believe the presence of the Big Four has coincided with that of a new \" Golden Era \" in men 's tennis since 2010 , wherein depth , athleticism and quality have never been better . The era has been compared to that of Rod Laver , Ken Rosewall , Roy Emerson and John Newcombe throughout the 1960s and that of Bj\u00f6rn Borg , Jimmy Connors , John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl during the late 1970s and early 1980s . While Novak Djokovic himself recognises it as a golden era , Roger Federer remains skeptical : A comparison of the total top-level singles titles won by this current Big Four and other previous dominant quartets helps to put things in perspective . As the table below shows , the Big Four 's career tallies of Grand Slam tournament titles , Masters Series titles , and overall titles have already surpassed the other three quartets . They have also matched the top Year End Tour Finals tally . Note 1 An observation to make is that both Laver and Rosewall were banned from competing in Grand Slam tournaments during most of the 1960s.To quote Malcolm Knox a sports columnist \" If grand slams are taken as the benchmark , consider this . The pro tour put Laver out of 20 grand slams from age 23 to 28 in his prime \" . and instead competed in Professional Slam tournaments . The draw of the Pro majors was significantly smaller than the traditional tournaments of Grand Slam events ; usually they only had 16 or even less professional players . Though they were usually the top 16 ranked players in the world at the time . Note 2 The focus of the article is on singles achievements and excludes notable doubles and mixed doubles titles across all six selection criteria won by previous big four candidates . If you take all results into consideration , then the following grouping of Laver \/ Rosewall \/ Emerson \/ Newcombe would add another 57 combined titles making their figure 133 titles overall , if we take the Borg \/ Connors \/ Lendl \/ McEnroe group a further 40 combined titles would make their tally 168 titles overall , and the grouping of Edberg \/ Agassi \/ Sampras \/ Becker would include 12 additional doubles titles bringing their total to 105 titles overall . Roger Federer 's own comments above reflect these facts in defining a new Golden period of tennis , \" But then again we don 't play doubles . We don 't play mixed \" , \" but we have somewhat of a golden era right now \" , however Nadal has won 3 Masters 1000 doubles titles , and Federer has won 1 Masters 1000 doubles title and an Olympic gold medal in doubles , which would therefore add 5 more titles to the Big Four 's Top-Level tournament tally , bringing it to 157 titles overall . Note 3 Other notable big fours by previous decades achievements below ( excluding year end and Masters Series performances , as they did not exist ) . 1920s Henri Cochet , Ren\u00e9 Lacoste , Jean Borotra and Bill Tilden ( 62 Slams ) . 1930s Fred Perry , Jack Crawford , Don Budge and Ellsworth Vines ( 63 Slams ) . 1940s Bobby Riggs , Jack Kramer , Frank Parker and John Bromwich ( 47 Slams ) . 1950s Pancho Gonzales , Frank Sedgman , Tony Trabert and Lew Hoad ( 67 Slams ) . Another way to view a comparison of current Big Four and other previous dominant quartets . = = = Prize money = = = Djokovic , Federer , Nadal , and Murray make up the top four prize money leaders of all time ( not adjusted for inflation ) . = = Rivalries = = The respective rivalries between the Big Four are considered to be some of the greatest of all time . Between the four of them they have played 190 matches against each other , 55 of which were at Grand Slam events . This includes 28 Grand Slam tournament finals , as well as 25 Grand Slam semifinal meetings , more than any other group of four players .

Nadal has had to defeat one of the other three members 19 times in order to win his 14 titles . This includes 8 wins over Djokovic ( 4 finals , 3 semifinals , 1 quarterfinal ) , 7 wins over Federer ( 6 finals , 1 semifinal ) , and 4 wins over Murray ( 3 semifinals , 1 quarterfinal ) . Furthermore , in order to win 6 of his 14 titles , he has had to defeat two of the Big Four in the same tournament . On 3 occasions he has had to defeat Federer and Djokovic , on 2 occasions he has had to defeat Federer and Murray , and on 1 occasion he has had to defeat Djokovic and Murray . Djokovic has had to defeat one of the other three members 15 times in order to win his 11 titles . This includes 7 wins over Federer ( 3 finals , 4 semifinals ) , 5 wins over Murray ( 4 finals , 1 semifinal ) , and 3 wins over Nadal ( 3 finals ) . Furthermore , in order to win 4 of his 11 titles , he has had to defeat two of the Big Four in the same tournament . On 2 occasions he has had to defeat Federer and Murray , on 1 occasion he has had to defeat Nadal and Federer , and on 1 occasion he has had to defeat Nadal and Murray . Federer has had to defeat one of the other three members 9 times in order to win his 17 titles . This includes 4 wins over Djokovic ( 1 final , 2 semifinals , 1 round of 16 ) , 3 wins over Murray ( 3 finals ) , and 2 wins over Nadal ( 2 finals ) . Furthermore , in order to win 2 of his 17 titles , he has had to defeat two of the Big Four in the same tournament . On both of these occasions he had to defeat Djokovic and Murray . Murray has had to defeat one of the other three members 2 times in order to win his 3 titles . On both of these occasions he defeated Djokovic in the final . = = = Federer vs. Nadal = = = Federer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004 and their rivalry is a significant part of both men 's careers . It is also considered one of the greatest in history . They have played 34 times ( seventh-highest in Open Era history ) , most recently in the 2015 Basel final , and Nadal leads their eleven-year-old rivalry 23 \u2013 11 . They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 14 September 2009 , when Nadal fell to world No. 3 ( Andy Murray became the new No. 2 ) . They are the only pair of men to have ever finished four consecutive calendar years at the top , eventually with 6 years from 2005 to 2010 . Federer was ranked no . 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004 . Nadal , who is five years younger , ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008 . Nadal leads their head-to-head 23 \u2013 11 . Fifteen of their 34 matches have been on clay which is statistically Nadal 's best surface and Federer 's worst with 13 being in the final . Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts ( 7 \u2013 2 ) and clay ( 13 \u2013 2 ) , while Federer leads on grass ( 2 \u2013 1 ) and indoor hard courts ( 5 \u2013 1 ) . Because tournament seedings are based on rankings , 21 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 8 Grand Slam tournament finals . From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final . Nadal won six of the eight , losing the first two Wimbledon finals . Three of these finals were five set-matches ( 2007 and 2008 Wimbledon , 2009 Australian Open ) , with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts . 11 of their 32 meetings have reached a deciding set . They have also played in 10 Masters Series finals , including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours . They also contested the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets . = = = Djokovic vs. Nadal = = = Djokovic and Nadal have the most head-to-head meetings in Open Era history with 49 meetings , which Djokovic leads 26 \u2013 23 . Nadal leads on grass 2 \u2013 1 and clay 14 \u2013 7 , but Djokovic leads on hard courts 18 \u2013 7 . They have met 13 times in Grand Slam tournaments with Nadal leading 9 \u2013 4 , and 4 \u2013 3 in finals . The rivalry is listed as the third greatest rivalry in the 2000s decade by ATPworldtour.com and is widely considered to be the greatest rivalry in the history of the sport . Djokovic is the first player to have at least ten match wins against Nadal and the only person to defeat Nadal seven times consecutively . He is also only the second player to have defeated Nadal in more than one Grand Slam tournament final ( the other being Federer ) and the first to beat Nadal in a final on a surface other than grass . Their 2012 Australian Open encounter is considered by many to be the greatest match ever played and their 2012 French Open semifinal is considered the best clay court match ever played . Between 2011 \u2013 12 , they met in four consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals , just the second time in tennis history this has happened . In doing so , they also became the only players in history , except for Venus and Serena Williams , to have faced the same opponent in the finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events . Djokovic defeated Nadal in the first three ( from Wimbledon to the Australian Open ) , making Nadal the first player in history to lose three consecutive Grand Slam event finals . However , Nadal defeated Djokovic in the French Open final , denying him a Career Grand Slam and the opportunity to become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four Majors at once . The two also share the record for the longest Australian Open and Grand Slam tournament final match ever played ( 5 hours and 53 minutes ) , at the 2012 Australian Open final . This and the 2013 French Open semifinal they contested , are considered two of the greatest matches of all time . At ATP Masters 1000 level , they have met 25 times , 12 of which were in the final ( a record ) , including the 2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters , where Djokovic ended Nadal 's 47-match winning run and eight-year winning streak at the event . = = = Djokovic vs. Federer = = = Djokovic and Federer have played each other 45 times with Djokovic leading 23 \u2013 22 . Djokovic leads on grass 2 \u2013 1 , while they are tied 17 \u2013 17 on hard courts and 4 \u2013 4 on clay . In terms of number of matches played , it ranks as the second largest rivalry in the Open Era . The rivalry is the largest in Grand Slam tournament history with 15 matches played , having won against each other matches at each of the four Grand Slams . Djokovic leads this category 9 \u2013 6 ( they are tied 3 \u2013 3 at the US Open , 1 \u2013 1 at Roland Garros , and Djokovic leads 3 \u2013 1 in Australia and 2-1 in Wimbledon ) . They have played in four Grand Slam tournament finals , the 2007 US Open , which Federer won in straight sets and at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015 and the 2015 US Open , won by Djokovic . They 've also met in a record ten semifinals . The rivalry between Federer and Djokovic is considered one of the best in the Open Era . Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive Grand Slam tournaments ( 2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open ) , and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double-figure career wins over Federer . Djokovic is one of four players currently on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Major and the only player to do it three times . Between 2007 \u2013 2011 they played a record five times at the US Open ( tied with Lendl \u2013 McEnroe and Connors \u2013 Lendl ) , with Federer winning the first three and Djokovic the last two . This includes the 2010 and 2011 semifinals they contested , both of which Djokovic saved two match points before going on to win the match . In contrast Federer is the only player beside Nadal to have achieved 20 career wins against Djokovic and ended Djokovic 's 43-match winning streak and 41 \u2013 0 start to the 2011 season , by defeating him in the French Open semifinals . These three matches have been classified among the greatest matches in tennis history by the ATP . At ATP Masters 1000 level , they have met 18 times , and they are both tied 9 \u2013 9 , while Djokovic leads 4 \u2013 3 in finals . The pair have also contested one final at the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals , which Djokovic won in straight sets . They were scheduled to meet again in the 2014 final but Federer withdrew . The pair met four times in 2014 , in the semifinal of the Dubai Tennis Championships , with Federer recording his first victory over Djokovic since 2012 and first deciding set victory over another member of the Big Four since 2010 , in the final of Indian Wells the following week , with this time Djokovic coming out on top , Monte-Carlo semifinal with Federer winning in straight sets , and at Wimbledon , with Djokovic winning in five sets . They have met six times so far in 2015 , at the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships with Federer winning in straight sets , the final of the Indian Wells Masters with Djokovic winning in three sets , the final of the Rome Masters , which Djokovic won in straight sets , the final of Wimbledon , which Djokovic won in four sets , the final of the Cincinnati Masters , which Federer won in straight sets and 2015 US Open , which Djokovic won in four sets . = = = Djokovic vs. Murray = = = Djokovic and Murray have met 34 times with Djokovic leading 24 \u2013 10 . Djokovic leads 5 \u2013 1 on clay , 19 \u2013 7 on hard courts , and Murray leads 2 \u2013 0 on grass . The two are almost the same age , with Murray being a week older than Djokovic . The pair have met in six Grand Slam tournament finals : the 2011 Australian Open , 2012 US Open , 2013 Australian Open , 2013 Wimbledon Championships , 2015 Australian Open and 2016 Australian Open . Djokovic won in Australia four times , and Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon . Between 2012 \u2013 13 , the pair met nine times , including three Major finals , and were ranked as the two highest ranked players in the world between May and August 2013 . During this time , the rivalry rose in prominence as the emerging rivalry in tennis . Since then , Djokovic has dominated the rivalry , winning eight matches in a row , before Murray stopped his winning streak in the final of the 2015 Rogers Cup . The US Open final they contested equalled the record as the longest US Open final in history , as well as the second longest major final in Open Era history , behind the 2012 Australian Open final . It also featured the longest ever tie-break in a US Open final , with a 12 \u2013 10 final score in the first set . Other notable matches include a nearly five-hour-long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open , which Djokovic won 7 \u2013 5 in the fifth set , as well as a semifinal meeting at the 2012 Olympic Games , with Murray winning in straight sets . At ATP Masters 1000 level , they 've met thirteen times , with Djokovic leading 8 \u2013 5 . Eight of these meetings came in finals , and they are tied at 4 \u2013 4 . Their most notable match in this category was in the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters , where Djokovic saved 5 championship points to win the title , ending Murray 's perfect 12 \u2013 0 record at the event . This , and the three set match they played in Rome in 2011 , were voted the ATP World Tour Match of the Year , for each respective season . = = = Federer vs. Murray = = = Federer and Murray have met 25 times , with Federer leading 14 \u2013 11 . Federer leads 12 \u2013 10 on hard courts and 2 \u2013 1 on grass , and they have never met on clay . Overall , Federer leads Murray 5 \u2013 1 in Grand Slam events , three of which were finals , once each at the US Open , Australian Open and Wimbledon Championships , all of which Federer won . However , Murray leads their head-to-head 9 \u2013 8 in three-set tennis , leading 6 \u2013 3 at ATP Masters 1000 level ( 2 \u2013 0 in finals ) with Federer ahead 3 \u2013 1 in the matches they 've contested at the ATP World Tour Finals , with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008 and Federer coming out victorious in London in 2009 , 2010 and in 2012 . In 2012 , exactly four weeks after the two met in the Wimbledon final , they met again on Centre Court for the final of the Olympic Games . Murray exacted revenge on Federer by winning in straight sets for the loss of just 7 games , claiming the gold medal and at the same time denying Federer a Career Golden Slam . Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories against Federer , the other two being Nadal and Djokovic . The pair have only met three times since 2012 , with Murray recording his first victory over Federer at Grand Slam event level with a five set victory in the semifinals of the 2013 Australian Open , and Federer reversing the result in the quarterfinal the following year . Federer won their meeting at the 2014 Cincinnati Masters quarter-final in straight sets . = = = Murray vs. Nadal = = = Murray and Nadal have met on 24 occasions , on all surfaces and at every Grand Slam tournament , with Nadal leading 17 \u2013 7 . Nadal leads 7 \u2013 2 on clay , 3 \u2013 0 on grass and 7 \u2013 5 on hard courts . The pair regularly meet at Grand Slam tournaments , with nine of their meetings coming at this level , with Nadal leading 7 \u2013 2 ( 3 \u2013 0 at Wimbledon , 2 \u2013 0 at the French Open and 1 \u2013 1 at both the Australian & US Open ) . The pair are the only match-up within that of the Big Four that have not contested a Grand Slam tournament final , despite one of them occupying a finalist spot in every final between the 2009 US Open and 2014 Wimbledon Championships . However , they 've met in 6 semi-finals and 2 quarter-finals , making the rivalry an important part of both men 's careers . In 2011 the pair met in three consecutive Grand Slam tournament semi-finals from the French Open to the US Open , with Nadal defeating Murray every time . Murray leads 3 \u2013 1 in ATP finals , with Nadal winning Indian Wells in 2009 and Murray winning the two ATP 500 finals they 've contested in Rotterdam the same year and Tokyo in 2011 , as well as Madrid in 2015 . The pair did not meet in 2012 or 2013 , partly because both Murray and Nadal suffered from injury . However , they renewed their rivalry in 2014 with a quarter-final meeting at the Rome Masters , with Nadal winning in three tight sets . The pair met again in the semi-finals of French Open two weeks later , with Nadal winning comfortably in straight sets on his way to winning his ninth French Open title . = = = Head-to-head records vs other players = = = As of June 2 , 2016 , a total of 101 different players have played against each member of the Big Four at least once . The following table presents the Big Four 's Head-to-head records against the only 14 players that have posted at least 1 victory against each of them , hth as well as their records against the only 2 players who have posted at least 1 victory over 3 of them and have also won at least 10 matches overall .

Another way to view their respective careers and evolution is to look at the progression of titles won by the number of tournaments played to win each of their titles at each level of competition including Grand Slams , Olympic Games , ATP World Tour Finals ( formerly Tennis Masters Cup ) , ATP World Tour Masters 1000 ( formerly ATP Masters Series ) . = = Notable matches = = With a combined total of 210 matches played , the Big Four have played many notable matches . The 2008 Wimbledon final and the 2012 Australian Open finals are considered the greatest matches of all time , . Novak Djokovic saved match points against Roger Federer at the 2010 and 2011 US Open semifinals , whereas Federer ended Djokovic 's 43-match winning streak in the 2011 French Open semifinals . The 4 hour 50 minute 2012 Australian Open semifinal between Murray and Djokovic is said to have given Murray the belief he needed to match the other members of the Big Four . Moreover , every Grand Slam tournament final of 2012 , all played between the Big Four , holds some historical significance . The 2012 Australian Open final was the longest Grand Slam tournament final in terms of time played , the 2012 French Open saw Rafael Nadal break the record for the most number of titles at the French Open , whereas Djokovic was attempting to become the first man to hold all four Majors since Rod Laver in 1969 . The 2012 Wimbledon final saw Federer equal the record for most Wimbledon titles when he came out victorious against Murray , who become the first British man since 1938 to appear in the final . The 2012 US Open final was the equal longest final in US Open history , and Murray became the first British man since 1938 to win a Major title , and the only British man to do so in the Open Era . He also became the only man to win Olympic Singles Gold and the US Open back-to-back . = = = 2007 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2007 Wimbledon Gentlemen 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships . It pitted world No. 1 Roger Federer against world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in a Major final for the fourth time . This was a rematch of the Wimbledon final from the year before and would become the defining match of the Federer \u2013 Nadal rivalry up to that point . This was a historic match as Federer was trying to equal Bj\u00f6rn Borg 's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles , while Nadal was attempting to be the first man since Borg in 1980 to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back ( this achievement is colloquially known as the \" Channel Slam \" ) . Federer defeated Nadal in five compelling sets in three hours and forty-five minutes , for a fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship ( equalling the feat achieved by Bj\u00f6rn Borg ) . Borg himself returned to Wimbledon for the first time since losing the final in 1981 , saying \" I just feel that this is the right time for me to come back , to hopefully watch Roger winning his fifth title in a row to match my record . \" This match marked only the third time in the new century that a Major final had gone to five sets , and was the first time the technology Hawk-Eye was ever used in a Wimbledon final . = = = 2008 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2008 Wimbledon Gentlemen 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships . A part of the storied rivalry between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , it pitted the two players , then ranked world No. 1 and No. 2 respectively , against each other in a Major final for the sixth time ( out of eight ) . After 4 hours and 48 minutes , Nadal defeated Federer in five sets in failing light . A number of tennis critics promptly lauded it as the greatest match in tennis history . This was the longest Wimbledon men 's singles final in history , clocking in at four hours and forty-eight minutes . The match also featured numerous rain delays which meant the match finished in near darkness , at 21 : 15 BST , almost seven hours since the match started at 14 : 35 BST . It was to be the last Wimbledon final to be significantly affected by rain , as a retractable roof was being installed at Centre Court and would be in place by the 2009 Wimbledon Championships . = = = 2009 Australian Open final = = = The 2009 Australian Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2009 Australian Open . It was contested between the world 's top two players for much of the previous four years , Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer then world number 's 1 and 2 respectively . It was their seventh ( out of eight ) Grand Slam tournament final meeting and it was the same final match up as had been previously at both the 2008 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final and 2008 French Men 's Singles final , both of which Nadal won . However this was Rafael Nadal 's first Major hardcourt final while it was Roger Federer 's ninth and was yet to lose in a Major hardcourt final . Nadal defeated Federer in 5 sets in 4 hours and 19 minutes , with the match finishing after midnight , to become the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open . The match was lauded as one of the greatest ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time , only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final . It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all-time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by Pete Sampras and the open-era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with Andre Agassi ( he would go on to achieve these in the near future ) . However , as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records , holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career . Not only that but he became the first man in the open-era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time . This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that . The defeat brought Federer to tears as he came to terms with his loss . The match statistics followed a similar pattern to those at the 2008 Wimbledon Final , with Federer having a lower first serve percentage against Nadal ( 51 % vs 64 % ) and he again couldn 't be as clincical on break point opportunities with only 31 % break points converted for Federer whereas Nadal converted 43 % of his break points . However the total points by each player proved even closer that that at that Wimbledon final , as Federer won 1 more point than Nadal ( 174 vs 173 ) yet still lost this final . = = = 2010 US Open final = = = The 2010 US Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2010 US Open . It pitted then-world No. 1 Rafael Nadal against then-world No. 3 Novak Djokovic in a Major final for the first time , having previously met four times at this level ( one quarter-final and three semi-finals , all won by Nadal ) . This was the first US Open final reached by Nadal , having previously fallen in the semi-finals in the previous two years , while for Djokovic , this was the first Major final he reached since winning his then-only Major title at the 2008 Australian Open . To reach the final , both players had to beat their semi-final opponents in contrasting circumstances : Nadal easily defeated Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets , while Djokovic saved several match points in the fifth set to overcome Roger Federer in five sets , thus denying what would have been the first ever Federer-Nadal final at Flushing Meadows . Nadal defeated Djokovic in four sets in three hours and forty-three minutes , to win his first US Open title , and thus complete the Career Golden Slam ( equalling the feat achieved by Andre Agassi ) . He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows , became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open , Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the second man after Laver to hold two Major titles on each surface ( hard , clay and grass ) . The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships . This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months . = = = 2011 French Open semifinal = = = The 2011 French Open Men 's Singles semifinal between world No. 2 Novak Djokovic and world No. 3 Roger Federer was a historic encounter that brought about the end of the longest winning streak in almost 30 years . Djokovic entered the match undefeated for the first five months of the year having gone 41 \u2013 0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches ( his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals ) . It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer . Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011 , however , Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets . Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was clear that if the match went to a fifth set it would have to be continued the next day . Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5 \u2013 4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker . Federer then played Nadal in the final , which was their record eighth encounter in a Grand Slam tournament final . Nadal defeated Federer for the fifth time at Roland Garros and tied Bj\u00f6rn Borg 's record of six French Open titles . = = = 2012 Australian Open final = = = The 2012 Australian Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2012 Australian Open . It pitted the world 's top two players , Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal , against each other in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fourth time ( out of seven ) and third consecutive time . Djokovic defeated Nadal in five sets to win the match . At five hours and fifty-three minutes , it was the Major final match with the longest duration in history . During the trophy ceremony , both Nadal and Djokovic required chairs , as they were both so tired that they couldn 't stand . It was lauded as one of the greatest matches ever by former players , legends , and analysts of the sport . John McEnroe claimed it surpassed the 2008 Wimbledon final as the best tennis match of all time , while legends Pete Sampras , Mats Wilander , and Bj\u00f6rn Borg said it was the best match they saw in their lifetime . After the 2012 Australian Open , Rod Laver came out with his greatest in the amateur and Open Era lists , Djokovic was ranked 6th and Nadal 5th on the Open Era list . Laver said the 2012 Australian Open final was a main reason for including both players . Nadal called it the toughest loss of his career but the best match he ever played . Djokovic said it was the finest win in his career and also commented on the high level of tennis played . Not only was this the longest Grand Slam tournament final , but according to Tennis Channel and the Australian Open TV networks , this was one of the most-watched finals , despite ending late into the night locally . Soon after the conclusion of the 2012 Australian Open , there were sources claiming that Djokovic sealed his spot as a tennis great and in the Tennis Hall of Fame . = = = 2012 French Open final = = = The 2012 French Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2012 French Open . It pitted the world 's top two players , Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal , against each other in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fifth time overall and fourth consecutive time . This match had historical proportions as Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors simultaneously , whereas Nadal was looking to break Bj\u00f6rn Borg 's record of six French Open titles and equal Chris Evert 's record of seven French Open titles held by a man or woman . Nadal defeated Djokovic in a two-day final in four sets , to ultimately achieve his seventh French Open title and deny Djokovic a Career Grand Slam . With Nadal leading by two sets to one , and Djokovic leading 2 \u2013 1 on serve in the fourth set , the match was suspended due to rain ; it was initially thought that Djokovic had gained the momentum , having won eight consecutive games prior to the suspension of the match , however , Nadal was able to regroup and take the fourth set , and ultimately the match , after Djokovic double-faulted on championship point down . = = = 2012 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2012 Wimbledon Gentlemen 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Gentlemen 's Singles tournament at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships . It pitted world No. 3 Roger Federer against world No. 4 Andy Murray in a Major final for a third time . This final snapped a streak of four consecutive Major finals reached by Djokovic and Nadal . Nadal was ousted in the second round while Federer defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals . In what was the most historic Major final of the year , Federer sought to win a record shattering seventeenth Major title and a record-tying seventh Wimbledon to match his idol Pete Sampras . Both of these records are amongst the most prestigious in all of tennis . Murray on the other hand had become the first British man since Bunny Austin in 1938 to reach the Wimbledon final , and was attempting to become the first Briton to win any Major title since Fred Perry in 1936 . Federer defeated Murray in four riveting sets in three hours and forty-four minutes , to capture a record equalling seventh Wimbledon championship , and a record breaking seventeenth Major title . The victory was also historic as it caused Federer to depose Djokovic as world No. 1 and break Sampras ' record of 286 weeks at the summit of men 's tennis ( Federer had been just one week short when he lost the number one ranking in June 2010 ) . At the beginning of the third set play was halted by rain and the roof which had been installed in 2009 was closed for the first time during the Wimbledon final . = = = 2012 US Open final = = = The 2012 US Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2012 US Open . It pitted then-world No. 3 Andy Murray against world No. 2 and defending champion Novak Djokovic in a Grand Slam tournament final for the second time . Murray defeated Djokovic in five sets to win the match . It was the equal-longest US Open men 's final in history , lasting four hours and fifty-four minutes ( equalling the 1988 US Open final played by Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander ) , and the equal second-longest men 's final in the Open era , only behind the aforementioned 2012 Australian Open final . By winning the 2012 US Open , Murray became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a Grand Slam singles title , and the first British man in the Open Era to do so . This was the most famous match in the rivalry between the two players . It also marked a milestone for Murray , as it was his 100th match win at a Major . This match featured the longest ever first set ( and the longest ever tiebreak ) in a men 's championship match ; the 87-minute first set , won by Murray , included four breaks of serve in the first four games of the match , a 54-shot rally in the sixth game , and the 24-minute tiebreak which lasted up until 12 \u2013 10 ; additionally , the tiebreak included two 30-shot rallies . Murray required six set points to win the first set , and required five sets to win the match . Murray said that a toilet break at the end of the fourth set helped him to restore his concentration after Djokovic took the third and fourth sets . = = = 2013 Australian Open final = = = The 2013 Australian Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2013 Australian Open . It pitted world No. 1 Novak Djokovic against world No. 3 Andy Murray in a Major final for the second time in as many Grand Slam tournaments and third time overall . Djokovic was looking to become just the third man in the Open Era to win the Australian Open four times and the first to win it three consecutive times . Murray , by reaching the final , had become the first man to reach the final of the next consecutive Grand Slam tournament after winning their first title . Murray took the first set on a tie-break just as he had done in the US Open final the previous year , and while the second set followed a similar pattern with no breaks of serve , this time Djokovic took the tie-break . One break of serve in the eighth game ( two hours and 52 minutes into the contest ) was enough for Djokovic to take the third set before taking the fourth 6 \u2013 2 comfortably against a tired-looking Murray , who needed four hours to defeat Federer in the semifinal just two days before . The match lasted three hours and 40 minutes and four sets . By winning Djokovic won his sixth Grand Slam tournament title to tie him with greats such as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg , whereas Murray equalled Edberg 's feat of three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open . = = = 2013 French Open semifinal = = = The 2013 French Open Men 's Singles semifinal was a rematch of the prior year 's final between Nadal and Djokovic . Just weeks after that victory , Nadal went on a lengthy injury hiatus of over 7 months before his highly successful return , reaching the final of all 8 tournaments he entered and winning 6 titles . But one of those losses was to Djokovic in Monte Carlo , ending Nadal 's record streak of 8 consecutive titles there . Djokovic was very motivated to win this match , having said winning his first French Open title was his highest priority of 2013 , plus his desire to dedicate the title in honor of his recently deceased childhood tennis coach . The match was a see-saw five setter with Nadal prevailing 9 \u2013 7 in the fifth after 4 hours and 37 minutes . Analyst Steve Tignor summed it up : \" This epic was a mirror image of their last one , in the 2012 Australian Open final . That day it had been Nadal who had survived a near-death experience in the fourth set , won it in a tiebreaker , and taken a 4 \u2013 2 lead in the fifth before watching Djokovic storm back for the title . Today it was Nole who broke Rafa at 3 \u2013 4 in the fourth and again at 5 \u2013 6 , grabbed that set in a tiebreaker , and led 4 \u2013 2 in the fifth before watching Nadal take it all away . In each of those matches , the loser was haunted by a stunning , crucial lapse . In Australia , with a chance to go up 5 \u2013 2 in the fifth , Nadal had missed the easiest of backhand passing shots . In Paris , serving at 4 \u2013 3 in the final set , Djokovic gave away a point when he ran into the net after hitting what would have been a winning overhead . \" Numerous tennis pundits and legends including Ivan Lendl , Andre Agassi , Bjorn Borg , Boris Becker , and John McEnroe claimed this was the greatest clay court match to ever take place in tennis history . ESPN commentator Chris Fowler and Patrick McEnroe even echoed this very remark during the broadcast of this match . Nadal then won the title for the fourth consecutive year . This was his 8th overall French title , making him the first man to win 8 titles at any Grand Slam tournament . His opponent was David Ferrer , who was the first Slam finalist outside the Big Four since Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych three years prior at Wimbledon . = = = 2013 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2013 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships .

After three hours and nine minutes , second seeded Murray defeated world No. 1 Djokovic in three sets to win the match . By winning the 2013 Wimbledon Championships , Murray became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win the Wimbledon title , the first Scottish man since Harold Mahony in 1896 to win the title , and the first British man in the Open Era to do so . = = = 2014 Wimbledon Championships final = = = The 2014 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final was the championship match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships . A significant part of the Djokovic \u2013 Federer rivalry , it pitted Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer against each other in a Grand Slam tournament final for the second time . After three hours and 56 minutes , top-seeded Djokovic defeated fourth-seeded Federer in five sets to win the match . By winning the 2014 Wimbledon Championships , Djokovic not only won for the second time , but also reclaimed the world number one ranking from Rafael Nadal at the conclusion of the tournament . He also stopped a losing run in Grand Slam tournament finals having lost his last 3 and 5 of his last 6 , Meanwhile , with his run to the final and showing in the final that he is still a major contender even at the age of 32 , Federer returned to the top 3 ranking positions after a lengthy period in the ranks 5 \u2013 8 range .

Andy Murray had a career resurgence on clay , making deep runs in the Masters tournaments prior to the French Open , finishing runner up to Djokovic in Madrid before besting him in Rome . Rain had affected the tournament schedule and in Djokovic 's case , he had to play 4 matches in 5 days . Murray was playing to become the first Brit since 1937 to win , while Djokovic had multiple historical records on the line , most notably joining the elite group of men who won a career grand slam and joining Rod Laver and Don Budge as the only men in the Open Era to hold all 4 Grand Slam titles at the same time . After Murray took the first set , Djokovic rallied to win the match prevailing 3-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 .",

        "doc": "History of slavery in Indiana = Slavery in Indiana occurred between the time of French rule during late seventeenth century and 1826 , with a few traces of slavery afterward . When the United States first forcibly removed the Native Americans from the region , slavery was accepted as a necessity to keep peace with the Indians and the French . When the Indiana Territory was established in 1800 , William Henry Harrison , a former slaveholder , was appointed governor and slavery continued to be tolerated through a series of laws enacted by the appointed legislature . Opposition against slavery began to organize in Indiana around 1805 , and in 1809 abolitionists took control of the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves . By the time Indiana was granted statehood in 1816 , the abolitionists were in firm control and slavery was banned in the constitution . In 1820 , an Supreme Court of Indiana ruling in Polly v. Lasselle freed all the remaining slaves in the state . An additional Supreme Court ruling in 1821 freed indentured servant Mary Bateman Clark , helping to bring an end to indentured servitude . With the end of slavery in the state , Indiana became a border state with the southern slave states . Hoosiers like Levi Coffin came to play an important role in the Underground Railroad that helped many slaves escape from the South . Indiana remained anti-slavery and in the American Civil War remained with the Union and contributed men to the war . = = Early existence = = In 1783 , at the end of the American Revolution , the territory that would become Indiana was annexed to the United States . Slavery was already a present institution \u2013 the French who had controlled the area only 20 years earlier , and their allies among the Native American Population , had been practicing slavery in the region for at least one hundred and fifty years before the Americans took control . Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle , first began explorations in Indiana in the late 1660s . He was accompanied by a Shawnee slave on several of his expeditions . In 1787 Congress organized the territory under the Northwest Ordinance , which prohibited slavery by stating \" that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory \" . It would later be decided that anyone who purchased a slave outside of the territory could enter and reside there with their slaves . The Ordinance also allowed for preexisting French \u2013 Indian slave arrangements . Many Virginian natives living in the territory interpreted the Ordinance as allowing them to have slaves . The Ordinance stated that the Virginians \" shall have their possessions and titles confirmed to them , and be protected in the enjoyment of their rights and liberties . \" Many decided to keep slaves . Fear of French rebellion kept the courts from acting against slavery , as did the violent actions of those who would kidnap escaped slaves . A court ruling in the Michigan Territory in 1807 stated that preexisting slavery could still exist under the Northwest Ordinance , validated Hoosier slaveholding in the opinions of the slaveholders . = = = Southern influence = = = Many of the territory 's early settlers came from the South . Southern immigrants who were anti-slavery settled in Ohio where a strong anti-slavery movement was underway . The immigrants in favor of slavery generally moved to Indiana where the government was friendly to slaveholders . When they relocated to the Indiana Territory , they brought what few slaves they owned with them . An 1810 census recorded 393 free blacks and 237 slaves in the Indiana Territory . Knox County , where the territorial capital of Indiana , Vincennes , was located , was the center of Indiana slavery . A young Army officer named Charles Larrabee , who was serving in Governor William Henry Harrison \u2019 s army , summed the Vincennes populace as \u201c chiefly from Kentucky and Virginia \u2026 slavery is tolerated here . \u201d Most of the initial immigration was attributed to the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 . After the Revolutionary War , George Rogers Clark and his soldiers , all Virginians , were given land grants in southern Indiana . Many settled in Indiana bringing their Southern ideals with them . After the War of 1812 many veterans of the Western theater were granted land in central Indiana . These soldiers were mostly from Kentucky and the South . They also moved into Indiana , bringing more Southern influence to the state . Southerners of all classes migrated to Indiana . William Henry Harrison , longtime Indiana Territory governor and future United States President , was from the long established aristocracy class of the lowland and coastal South . His class supported slavery . From the non-slaveholding class of the Upland South were migrants such as Abraham Lincoln , whose family is representative of the migration to Indiana from Kentucky and Tennessee . Some of his social class , while not owning slaves , typically condoned the institution . Lincoln 's father worked as a slave catcher and the family of Lincoln 's wife , Mary Todd , owned slaves . But others immigrated to Indiana such as Levi Coffin , a North Carolina Quaker who was an outspoken abolitionist . = = Treatment of slaves = = The first recorded slaves in Indiana were owned by the French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes . Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery as an alternative to executing their prisoners in war . According to some classical historians , the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was a direct result of the rise of slavery . Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts . The early slaves typically performed manual labor , helping the traders transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts . While part of new France , laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters . Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden , and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up . Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment . Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave , the slave and her children were then to be freed . Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors . As the territory developed , their tasks changed ; slaves also served as household servants and farm workers , as in the case of William Henry Harrison 's slaves . George Rogers Clark 's two slaves assisted him in running a gristmill in Clarksville . While the pro-slavery faction was in power , laws were passed permitting anyone to seize and return slaves who were more than ten miles from their home , and a one hundred dollar fine was placed on anyone who helped a slave escape . Some slaves , like \" Aunt Fannie \" , who belonged to Dennis Pennington , refused to be set free . Pennington had freed all his slaves when he left Virginia , but Fannie did not want to be left behind and continued on as a free household servant for the rest of her life . She was buried in the Pennington family cemetery in Corydon , Indiana . Others were not so fortunate as in the case of another black woman who also lived in Corydon . When she tried to escape from her masters she was run down in the street , beaten , and carried back home . The men threatened death to anyone in the town , which was strongly anti-slavery , who interfered . The slaves did not have a large impact on Indiana 's economy as they never became a large percentage of the population and large scale plantation style farms , that were common in the southern states , never developed in Indiana . In 1820 , the year all the state 's slaves were freed , the census only counted 192 out of a population over 65,000 . Many slaves had already been freed by that time and there over 1200 free blacks in the state during the same census . = = Indiana Territory = = Slavery in the Indiana Territory was supported by Governors William Henry Harrison and his successor Thomas Posey , who both sought to legalize it in the territory . Both men were appointed by the President of the United States while the office was held by southern slaveholders . Although slavery was not legal under Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance , Harrison recognized the existing customs of slavery and indenture in the territory , Both men 's slavery positions were resisted by the territory 's population . In a gesture to the residents who lived in the territory before the Northwest Ordinance , Harrison organized a public meeting in 1802 which called for a 10-year moratorium on the slavery ban . Harrison and Posey were strongly opposed by Jonathan Jennings , Dennis Pennington , and other prominent men who would eventually take over the territorial legislature . Indiana courts never ruled on the Ordinance \/ slavery issue during the territorial period . When the issue of slavery was in the courts , it \u201c was always treated as an existing institution and its legality went unchallenged . \u201d Early Hoosiers , including William Henry Harrison , wanted to have slavery legalized in the new territory . Harrison may have been motivated by the need to appease existing slaveowners , the need for labor in a developing territory , or the desire to attract immigrants from southern colonies . They sought passage of a new law to override the Northwest Ordinance 's ban on slavery . Harrison succeeded in getting permission from Congress for the territory to decide for itself whether slavery should be legalized . Harrison and his party sought to gradually legalize slavery three times ( 1803 , 1807 , and 1809 ) but all three efforts ultimately failed . Harrison succeeded , however , in passing laws that established forms of indentured servitude . Harrison was particularly interested in having slavery legalized . He maintained a plantation style home in Vincennes called Grouseland . Harrison was also in the process of constructing another plantation style farm called Harrison Valley near Corydon in 1807 , the same year he was pushing for slavery to be legalized . In 1803 Harrison asked Congress to suspend the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years . Harrison claimed it was necessary to increase the territory 's population more quickly and attract new settlers . Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially support it . In 1803 the entire territory 's population numbered less than 5,000 . That year the legislature \u2014 which was appointed by Harrison \u2014 passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude . In 1805 the Territory was granted representation in Congress . Pro-slavery Benjamin Parke was elected and supported Harrison 's request to have Congress suspend the ban on slavery in the territory . Parke submitted legislation to outright legalize slavery , but no action was taken on it . The same year , Congress suspended Article Six of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years , and granted the territories covered by it the right to choose for themselves to legalize slavery . By the same act , Congress removed the legislative power from the General Court of the territory and created a Legislative Council that would was to be popularly elected . When the election was complete Davis Floyd was the only anti-slavery member elected ; slavery had not yet become a major issue in the state . That year Harrison persuaded the legislature to begin the debate to legalize slavery . The bill was narrowly defeated because many of the slaveholders in the council wanted a concession from Harrison , namely to recommend creating the Illinois Territory , a concession which he refused to make . = = = Fight to end slavery = = = Harrison 's move to legalize slavery was not taken lightly by President Thomas Jefferson . Although Jefferson was himself a slaveholder , he was opposed to the spread of slavery . Jefferson had been working with James Lemen since at least 1784 and used him as an agent in the Northwest to organize an anti-slavery movement . Lemen succeeded in helping to establish an anti-slavery Baptist church that drew many members . Jefferson sent Lemen to the Indiana territory again in 1807 with the mission to seek out and organize the anti-slavery men of the state and encourage them to take action . Several prominent men had already been stirred by Harrison 's moves to legalize slavery . Dennis Pennington , a former slave holder who had freed his slaves when he moved to Indiana , was chief among the anti-slavery men . Jonathan Jennings , who also attended the meeting , would quickly grow into the party 's leader . Other prominent anti-slavery men included Richard Rue , John Paul , and General William Johnson , all veterans of the Revolution . Later in 1807 , at Lemen 's urging , a mass meeting was held in Springville attended by many of the anti-slavery men within the state . The meeting was held largely in response to Harrison 's attempt to legalize slavery and the fact that he almost succeeded , and likely would soon unless a large anti-slavery faction came to power . The meeting was chaired by John Beggs , with Davis Floyd acting as secretary . Dennis Pennington and others put forth speeches , and resolved to stop the attempt to legalize slavery . They declared their intentions to end the \" despised institution \" . Their resolution stated : ... a great number of citizens , in various parts of the United States , are preparing , and many have actually emigrated to this Territory , to get free from a Government which does tolerate slavery ... And although it is contended by some , that , at this day , there is a great majority in favor of slavery , whilst the opposite opinion is held by others , the fact is certainly doubtful . But when we take into consideration the vast emigration into this Territory , and of citizens , too , decidedly opposed to the measure , we feel satisfied that , at all events , Congress will suspend any legislative act on this subject until we shall , by the constitution , be admitted into the Union , and have a right to adopt such a constitution , in this respect , as may comport with the wishes of a majority of the citizens .... The toleration of slavery is either right or wrong ; and if Congress should think , with us , that it is wrong , that it is inconsistent with the principles upon which our future constitution is to be formed , your memorialists will rest satisfied that , at least , this subject will not be by them taken up until the constitutional number of the citizens of this Territory shall assume that right . When the petition was signed and circulated , it gained six hundred more signatures than the petition circulated to request the legalization of slavery . The same year , the abolitionists won their first victory over the Harrison faction . In the election for territorial delegate , Jesse B. Thomas , the anti-slavery factions candidate , defeated Harrison 's candidate . By 1809 the territory 's population had climbed to over 20,000 . Congress passed legislation that allowed the Indiana Territory to elect a bicameral legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison to dissolve the existing one and created the Illinois Territory . The effect of these actions , was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half . The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party . The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803 , and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction . They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state . The repeal of the laws was met with resentment and violence in Vincennes . An effigy of Jesse Bright was burnt in the street , and Rice Jones , a popular abolitionist , was murdered . = = = Abolitionist victory = = = In 1809 , Dennis Pennington , one of the most outspoken anti-slavery men and a friend of Henry Clay , was elected to the legislature as the representative from Harrison County , and became speaker of the assembly . His prominence allowed him to dominate the legislature . Before the constitutional convention in 1816 , Pennington was quoted as saying \" Let us be on our guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery . \" At the constitutional convention , the anti-slavery party was able to take control , electing Jennings as the president of the convention . It was by their actions that slavery was banned by the first constitution . When Indiana sought statehood in 1816 , there was talk of its entering as a slave state among the dwindling group of slavery supporters as illustrated in the March 2 , 1816 edition of the ( Vincennes ) Western Sun , where a \" citizen of Gibson \" stated , \" the best interests of humanity required the admission of slavery into the state . \" The eastern half of the state saw much debate over the slavery issue . While the state constitution did outlaw slavery and indentures , much of the population that had immigrated from the South were commoners and not landed slaveholders . Of the 43 men who wrote the constitution , 34 were either born or had once lived in the South , and the constitution was a near copy of the Kentucky constitution , save for the anti-slavery clause . During the first gubernatorial election , Jonathan Jennings 's campaign motto was \" No Slavery in Indiana \" . He easily defeated pro-slavery candidate Thomas Posey , and upon his victory he declared that Indiana was a \" Free State \" . He also asked the legislature to pass laws that would stop the \" unlawful attempts to seize and carry into bondage persons of color legally entitled to their freedom : and at the same time , as far as practical , to prevent those who rightfully owe service to the citizen of any other State of Territory , from seeking , within the limits of this State ( Indiana ) , a refuge from the possession of their lawful masters . \" He stated that such laws would help secure the freedom of many . This request resulted in the creation of a Man Stealing Act aimed to prevent slave hunters from operating in the state . In 1818 Dennis Pennington , then a state senator , had three Kentuckians indicted for violating the Man Stealing Act when they forcibly took a black woman from a home in Harrison County and removed her to Kentucky . Governor Jennings requested the Kentucky Governor send the men to Indiana for trials ; after several years of correspondence the Kentucky governor refused on constitutional grounds . These events led Jennings to eventually have to reverse his position and request that the legislature pass laws to discourage runaway slaves from seeking refuge in Indiana . Jennings said it was needed to \" maintain harmony between the states \" . From 1810 to 1820 , the number of free blacks in Indiana increased from 400 to 1200 . In 1820 the State Supreme Court case of Polly v. Lasselle ordered all slaves , except those held before the 1787 Northwest Territory Ordinance , to be freed . The new ruling led to a sharp decline in the state 's slave population . In 1820 the census recorded 190 slaves ; by the 1830 census there were only three . In 1823 , when Ohio passed resolutions asking the Federal government for a national ban on slavery , at the urging of Governor William Hendricks , the Indiana General Assembly issued a resolution which was forwarded the Federal government stating : \" Resolved That it is expedient that such a system should be predicated upon the principle that the evil of slavery is a national one and that the people and the States of this Union ought mutually to participate in the duties and burdens of removing it Therefore , \" Resolved By the General Assembly of the State of Indiana that we do approve of and cordially concur in the aforesaid resolutions of the State of Ohio and that His Excellency the Governor be requested to communicate the same to the Executives of each of the several States in the Union and each of our Senators and Representatives in Congress requesting their cooperation in all national measures to effect the grand object therein embraced . \" = = Indiana state = = = = = Remnants of slavery = = = Even with statehood , there was still slavery in Indiana . Despite slavery and indentures becoming illegal in 1816 due to the state constitution , the 1820 federal census listed 190 slaves in Indiana . Many Hoosier slaveholders felt that the 1816 constitution did not cover preexisting slavery ; others just did not care if it was illegal . In eastern Indiana nearly all slaveholders immediately freed their slaves . But the majority of slaveholders in western counties , especially in Knox , decided to keep their slaves . The Vincennes newspaper Western Sun had numerous times advertised \" indentured Negroes and other slaves \" , a sign of the approval of slavery in the area . \" In Knox County , virtually all of the ( slave ) suits were denied by the County Court in 1817 and 1818 . \" A black woman known as Polly was held slave by French trader Hyacinthe Lasselle of Vincennes . Polly sued in 1820 for her freedom , but was denied in the Knox County Court . She appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court , who ruled in her favor that she should be free . But even after this decision , there was slavery in Indiana . The federal census of 1830 still showed three slaves in Indiana : one each in Orange County , Decatur County , and Warrick County . A separate local census in Knox County in 1830 showed the presence of 32 slaves . Even in 1840 there were three slaves listed in the federal census as being in Indiana : a girl in Putnam County and a man and girl in Rush County . = = = Views upon slavery = = = A traveler from New York , Dr. Samuel Bernard Judah , described Vincennes in 1829 as having many blacks , making the observation of them being \u201c generally poorly clad \u2026 poor miserable race \u201d . Indiana Governor Noah Noble spoke with pride in December 1837 on how Indiana helped slaveholders recapture their escaped slaves . When Kentucky expressed displeasure at how some Hoosiers helped runaways , the Indiana legislature passed a resolution that stated acts by Northerners to interfere with the capture of runaways was \u201c unpatriotic and injurious to the stability of the Union . \u201d In 1851 Indiana adopted a new constitution , and among its new clauses was one that prohibited blacks from immigrating to Indiana . The prohibition was intended to be a punishment to the slavery states . Like several other northern states , Indiana lawmakers believed the majority of free blacks were uneducated and ill equipped to care for themselves . They believed since the South put them in that condition , they should be responsible for the \" burden \" of caring for them . This view , that the South should clean up its own mess , remained dominant even after the Civil War , and the clause in Indiana 's constitution was not repealed until the 20th century . = = = Abraham Lincoln = = = Abraham Lincoln lived in Indiana from 1816 until 1830 , age 7 to 21 . It was during these years that Lincoln first encountered slavery and began to form his opinions . Growing up in a climate where the state politics were run by men like Jennings and Pennington would have much influence on the development of Lincoln 's views . In 1860 when the American Civil War broke out , Indiana would remain part of the Union and contribute over 200,000 men to suppress the rebellion . By that act Hoosiers helped to outlaw slavery in the United States forever . = = = Underground Railroad = = = Many Indiana residents participated in the underground railroad . Two major arteries in the underground railroad traveled through Indiana . Tell City , Evansville , and Jeffersonville were two gateways to the underground railroad . An important stopover was Westfield , where food and hiding places were provided to slaves trying to reach Canada . Other safe houses dotted Indiana , including one in Town Clock Church ( pictured ) . Escaping slaves who entered Indiana would be ferried from safe house to safe house northward , usually into Michigan , where they could cross safely to Windsor , in Ontario , Canada . In one of the more famous events of the underground railroad , Eliza Harris , a slave from Kentucky , crossed the Ohio River one winter 's night when it froze over . She was aided in her escape by Levi Coffin of Fountain City , and eventually escaped to Ontario after being guided by Hoosiers from safe house to safe house through Indiana . Her story was the inspiration for the book Uncle Tom 's Cabin . Coffin and his wife would help as many as two thousand slaves escape the South .",

When the United States first forcibly removed the Native Americans from the region, slavery was accepted as a necessity to keep peace with the Indians and the French. When the Indiana Territory was established in 1800, William Henry Harrison, a former slaveholder, was appointed governor and slavery continued to be tolerated through a series of laws enacted by the appointed legislature. Opposition against slavery began to organize in Indiana around 1805, and in 1809 abolitionists took control of the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves."

The party sought to promote multiculturalism , advocate for rights of ethnic minorities and recent immigrants focusing on employment access , security , health care , education and overall rights and status . It was an advocacy party that sought to politically empower and enable those who do not speak English as a first language to participate in politics . Led by Wei Ping Chen , the party was founded in June 2007 . Chen stood for election in Richmond in the October 2008 federal election , and for mayor of Richmond , British Columbia in the November 2008 municipal election , losing both times .

Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing , via Australia . He witnessed the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country , and how uninvolved they were in politics . Contrasted to his experience in China , Wei Ping Chen was impressed with the political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party . He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English , would empower those communities to become more politically active . Wei Ping Chen was a candidate in the October 2008 federal election in the Richmond electoral district . However , because the party was not registered with Elections Canada , he ran as an independent . He came in fifth place , with 397 votes ( 0.93 % ) , losing to the Conservative Party 's Alice Wong .

Wei Ping Chen challenged incumbent Malcolm Brodie for the mayoral position and Kang Chen , Yang Dai , Jiajian Cheung , Jian Liu , and Bai Chen were nominated for councillor positions . Like the federal campaign , they were classified as independents . The latest census at the time reported that 50 % of Richmond 's population was of Chinese descent and their campaign highlighted the language barrier faced by those who did not speak English , for example tax notices were only available in English .

While the party did not maintain a full slate of policy positions , its candidates advocated for increasing the number of police in Richmond , especially along the SkyTrain route , protection of green spaces , support for affordable housing , and trade missions with China .

        "doc": "Australian Army during World War II = The Australian Army was the largest service in the Australian military during World War II . Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army was split into the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Following the outbreak of war , on 14 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force ( Second AIF ) , would be formed for overseas service . Meanwhile , conscription was introduced in October 1939 to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . The Australian Army subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 . Following the Japanese surrender Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces across the South West Pacific . Meanwhile , the Army contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan from 1946 . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions , and in August 1942 the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force was larger than Australia 's population and economy could sustain , and its strength was reduced in the second half of the year . Militia units were able to serve outside of Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 after the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed , but few did so . The Army was further reduced by 100,000 members from October 1943 to free up manpower for industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943 . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South West Pacific . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 . These units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles . This organisation proved only moderately successful , and the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns . The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities in August 1945 and was finally completed on 15 February 1947 . A total of 730,000 personnel enlisted in the Australian Army during the war , a figure which represented around 10 percent of the population . Nearly 400,000 men ultimately served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . As a proportion of its population , the Australian Army was ultimately one of the largest Allied armies during World War II . Casualties included 11,323 killed in action , 1,794 who died of wounds , and 21,853 wounded . Another 5,558 were killed or died as prisoners of war ( POWs ) , while non-battle casualties in operational areas were also significant and included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded or injured . In addition , the Army suffered a substantial number of casualties in non-operational areas : 1,795 soldiers killed and 121,800 wounded or injured . = = Background = = Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army consisted of the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Throughout the inter-war years , a combination of complacency and economic austerity had resulted in limited defence spending . In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , conscription was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Militia would be maintained on a part-time , voluntary basis only . The size of the Army remained small up until 1938 and 1939 when the Militia was rapidly expanded as the threat of war grew . In 1938 , there had been only 35,000 soldiers in the Militia , but by September 1939 this had been increased to 80,000 , supported by a PMF of 2,800 full-time soldiers whose main responsibility was largely to administer and train the Militia . This expansion had little impact on improving the readiness of Australian forces upon the outbreak of the war , though , as the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 restricted the pre-war Army to service in Australia and its territories including Papua and New Guinea . As a result , when Australia entered the war in 1939 , a new all-volunteer force was required that could fight in Europe or elsewhere outside of Australia 's immediate region . ( Similarly , in World War I the all-volunteer First Australian Imperial Force ( First AIF ) was raised and served with distinction at Gallipoli , in the Middle East and on the Western Front . ) From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by the \" Singapore strategy \" , which centred on the establishment of a major naval base at Singapore and the use of naval forces to respond to any future Japanese aggression in the region . As a maritime strategy , it resulted in a defence budget that was focused on building up the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , in order to support the British Royal Navy . Between 1923 and 1929 , \u00a3 20,000,000 was spent on the RAN , while the Australian Army and the munitions industry received only \u00a3 10,000,000 and the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) just \u00a3 2,400,000 . The strategy met significant political opposition from sections of the regular Army , including several prominent officers such as Henry Wynter and John Lavarack . Wynter in particular argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe and would be unable to send sufficient resources to Singapore . He contended that Singapore was vulnerable , especially to attack from the land and the air , and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN . During the 1930s the Australian Army 's organisation , equipment and doctrine were similar to those of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports . While the Army recognised that there was a threat of war with Japan , little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia 's eastern seaboard , along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia . The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s , but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations due to a lack of resources as a result of limited defence expenditures . Nevertheless , the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand the Army in the event of war , and indeed during the course of the war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service . In 1942 the Army adopted the title Australian Military Forces ( AMF ) to encompass the various categories of service : AIF , Militia and Permanent Forces . Wartime exigencies required a rapid expansion of the Army and during the war 730,000 personnel enlisted in either the Militia or the AIF , a figure which represented around 10 percent of Australia 's population of just seven million , one of the highest percentages of any of the Allied armies during World War II . It subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 as part of British Commonwealth forces , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 primarily in conjunction with forces from the United States . Nearly 400,000 men served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . = = Organisation = = = = = Origin of the Second Australian Imperial Force = = = Australia entered World War II on 3 September 1939 . On 14 September Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force , would be formed for overseas service . Like its predecessor , the Second AIF was a volunteer force formed by establishing entirely new units . In many cases these units drew their recruits from the same geographical areas as First AIF units , and they were given the same numerical designations albeit with the prefix \" 2 \/ \" . In October 1939 , conscription was introduced to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . From January 1940 , all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service . While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military , the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service . A side effect of this arrangement was the creation of two different armies with different conditions of service , one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF . This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war , as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces . Later , provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service . This required 65 percent of a unit 's war establishment \u2014 or 75 percent of its actual strength \u2014 to volunteer and allowed whole battalions to become part of the AIF . An early problem was whether to adopt the British or Australian organisation . In 1939 the British Army was in the process of re-equipping with new weapons , and a new organisation was required . This new equipment was not available in Australia , so it was decided to organise the first unit to be raised \u2014 the 6th Division \u2014 with some elements of the old organisation and some of the new . Consequently , the 6th Division was raised as an infantry division of around 18,000 personnel , and initially comprised twelve 900-man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies , a battalion headquarters , regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals , mortars , carriers , pioneers , anti-aircraft and administration . Artillery support was provided by three field regiments , each attached at brigade-level , as well an anti-tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with armoured vehicles . Corps troops included a machine-gun battalion , and various engineer , logistics and communication units . Three further AIF infantry divisions were formed during 1940 : the 7th Division in February 1940 , the 8th Division in May and the 9th Division in June . However , the establishment of these divisions was reduced to the new nine-battalion organisation as the size of an Australian division was reduced to approximately 17,000 men , and the three surplus battalions of the 6th Division became part of the 7th Division . Further changes included the addition of a light anti-aircraft regiment at divisional level , and a reorganisation of the divisional artillery from three four-battery regiments consisting of 16 guns to three two-battery regiments of 12 guns . An AIF corps headquarters , designated I Corps , was formed in March 1940 along with various support units . The 1st Armoured Division , the final AIF division to be formed , was established in July 1941 , built around a core of two armoured brigades each consisting of three tank-equipped armoured regiments , supported by motorised cavalry , armoured cars , engineers and artillery . Several units , such as Z and M Special Units , were also raised for irregular warfare as were 12 commando companies . Many corps , support and service units were also raised during the war to provide combat and logistical support . = = = Forces in Australia and the Pacific = = = The Army 's command and administrative arrangements at the start of the war were based on a system of military districts that had existed since Federation , albeit with a number of modifications . Australia was divided into six military districts each of which largely equated to a State or Territory , and reported to the Department of the Chief of the General Staff . Meanwhile , the Military Board was responsible for the administration of the Army , with regular members consisting of the Deputy Adjutant-General , the Chief of Intelligence , the Chief of the General Staff , the Chief of Ordnance and a civilian Finance Member , in addition to a number of consultative members , under the overall control of the Minister of the Defence . The 1st Military District ( 1 MD ) encompassed Queensland , the 2nd included most of New South Wales , the 3rd was primarily based on Victoria , the 4th included South Australia , the 5th included Western Australia and the 6th encompassed forces in Tasmania . In 1939 the Northern Territory was designated the 7th Military District , while and the 8th Military District was later activated in Port Moresby to command forces in New Guinea . Following the outbreak of World War II a regional command structure was subsequently adopted , with 2 MD becoming Eastern Command , 5 MD redesignated Western Command , while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales , Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command . In the early years of the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas ; however , as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure . The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan 's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation . In response , the Army command structure was reorganised in early 1942 . While Western Australia remained unchanged , Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas , 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force . In July 1942 the Military Board 's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces , General Sir Thomas Blamey . The AIF 's requirements for manpower and equipment constrained the Militia during the early years of the war . At the outbreak of the Pacific War the main Army units in Australia were five Militia infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th Divisions \u2014 two Militia cavalry divisions \u2014 the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions \u2014 and the AIF 1st Armoured Division . The Volunteer Defence Corps ( VDC ) , which was a part-time volunteer force of 100,000 men based on the British Home Guard , was also available for local defence . In addition , by early 1942 there were 12,000 garrison force personnel \u2014 mostly reservist veterans of World War I \u2014 organised into 13 garrison battalions for coastal defence and five battalions and two companies for internal security tasks , including guarding prisoner of war camps . Yet at this time only 30 percent of Militia units were on full-time duty , with the remainder periodically undertaking three month-long mobilisations . The Militia was also poorly armed , and there was insufficient equipment to be issued to all units if they were mobilised . In response to the Japanese threat following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the capture of the 8th Division in Malaya , the condition of the Militia became a pressing concern , after largely having been ignored since 1940 . Several middle-ranking and senior officers of the AIF were subsequently posted to Militia units and formations to give them experience . Meanwhile , the Army was forced to move units between Militia divisions so that the most combat-ready could be sent to areas believed to be under the greatest threat of attack . Some battalions were amalgamated , and although some were later separated and reformed , others were disbanded altogether . After the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed Militia units were able to serve outside Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 , though the 11th Brigade was the only major formation to do so . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 7th , 9th , 10th , 11th and 12th Divisions \u2014 and three armoured divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd and 3rd \u2014 organised into the First and Second Armies , and I , II and III Corps , as well as many support and service units . In August 1942 , the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force proved larger than what Australia 's population and industry could sustain ; by late 1942 the number of personnel who needed to be inducted each month to make good losses caused by sickness and combat was much larger than the numbers who were becoming eligible for service , and the allocation of a high proportion of Australia 's limited supply of manpower to the military was inhibiting the expansion of the munitions industry and other key sectors of the economy . The Army was also unbalanced as a large majority its personnel were employed in arms corps undertaking combat and combat support roles . Heavily reliant upon its allies for logistical support , it required more personnel in support arms such as ordnance and transport to be functional as a self-sufficient organisation . This situation was most acute in 1942 ; at that time there were 137,236 men serving arms corps such as infantry , cavalry and armour , while there were just 29,079 in ordnance . This imbalance was slowly addressed after 1942 as the Army 's size was reduced . Most of the units that were disbanded were Militia arms corps units , and by September 1943 the AIF outnumbered the Militia , having 265,000 members compared to just over 117,000 . Further reductions came in October 1943 when the Army 's strength was further reduced by 100,000 men to free up manpower to work in industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . By 1945 the support arms had grown considerably as a proportion of the total force and by August 1945 ordnance and the electrical and mechanical engineers totalled 42,835 men , while the artillery had been reduced to half its previous strength . Infantry , cavalry and armoured corps personnel numbered just 62,097 men , while engineers , signals and the medical services remained the same , albeit as part of a much smaller Army . Regardless , at the end of the war it remained one of the largest Allied armies as a proportion of population , being second only to the Soviet Union . The VDC was also reduced in size in May 1944 , and was finally disbanded on 24 August 1945 . If the conflict had continued past August 1945 , the size of the Army would have been further reduced to three divisions once Bougainville , New Guinea and New Britain had been secured . Two of these divisions would have been used on garrison duties , while a brigade group may have been made available for British-led operations in South East Asia and the remaining division was to take part in the invasion of Japan . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 when the 1st Armoured Division was formed . The two Militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed to provide support to the infantry . These large armoured units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 , reducing the authorised strength of the division by about 4,000 men . Each infantry battalion shed around 100 personnel as various support elements such as the anti-aircraft and carrier platoons were removed and consolidated at divisional level . The amount of heavy weapons and vehicles was also reduced , but the conditions that the organisation was designed for did not recur and it proved only moderately successful . As a result , the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns by returning the artillery and anti-tank units that had been removed . The creation of the jungle divisions represented the first time in the Australian Army 's history that it had adopted an organisation specifically for the conditions in which its forces would fight . Previously force structure had been heavily influenced by the British Army , and the decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence . Yet it also resulted in the adoption of a two-tier force structure , as formations that were not designated for jungle warfare remained on the previous scales of equipment and manning . Ultimately , while their structure was better suited to operations in Australia , they were no longer able to be used against the Japanese . As a result , the burden of the fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re-organised , while the remainder of the Army was relegated to garrison duties . The Army also raised many anti-aircraft and coastal defence units during the war . The pre-war coastal defences were greatly expanded from 1939 , and many new batteries were built near major ports in Australia and New Guinea in response to the threat of Japanese attack . Australia had a limited capacity to produce anti-aircraft guns , and the bulk of equipment had to come from Britain . As such the development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment . The coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944 . The Army had few anti-aircraft guns at the outbreak of war , and a high priority was given to expanding the air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities . By 1942 anti-aircraft batteries were in place around all the major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia . The expansion of the artillery in general , and coastal defence and anti-aircraft units in particular , meant that by June 1942 some 80,000 of the 406,000 members of the Army were artillerymen . VDC units gradually took over responsibility for manning the fixed coastal and anti-aircraft defences as the threat of attack against the Australian mainland receded . Traditionally the Australian Army had relied on its major allies to provide logistic support , primarily raising combat units rather than support arms during times of conflict . Consequently , these services were relatively underdeveloped , and they remained so during the first years of the war . While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941 , the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war . As a result , the growth of the support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic , including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining . These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships , food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas . In addition , with Australia 's national support base located well to the rear , in the major cities in the south-east of the country , significant expansion of the Army 's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea . Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia , while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft . = = = Women 's services = = = Prior to World War II the Australian Army Nursing Service ( AANS ) was the only female branch of the Army . A reserve formation that had served overseas during World War I , the AANS was mobilised following the outbreak of war in 1939 and its Matron in Chief , Grace Wilson , served on the staff of the Director-General of Medical Services , Major General Rupert Downes . For most of the war , AANS nurses were the only Australian servicewomen permitted to serve overseas , and many volunteered for the AIF . These women served in all the major theatres in which the Army fought and a total of 71 were killed on active service . The majority of these died in early 1942 during the fighting in Malaya and Singapore where 41 nurses were killed . In March 1942 , the Volunteer Aid Detachments ( VADs ) also became a branch of the Army Medical Service . Consisting of volunteers originally coordinated by the Australian Red Cross and Order of Saint John , the VADs were redesignated the Australian Army Medical Women 's Service ( AAMWS ) in December 1942 , and were employed in military hospitals in Australia and overseas until after the end of the war , before returning to civilian control in 1948 . Shortages of manpower also led to the establishment of the Australian Women 's Army Service ( AWAS ) in August 1941 . AWAS members filled a wide range of roles to allow the Army to redeploy male soldiers to fighting units . While they mainly worked in clerical and administrative positions , and auxiliary roles such as drivers and signallers , many served in anti-aircraft batteries , operating radars and searchlights but not the guns themselves . While Blamey sought to have members of the AWAS posted overseas from early 1941 onwards , the Australian Government did not agree to this until 1945 . As a result , only about 400 of the 24,000 women who joined the AWAS served outside Australia . The AWAS was reduced in size following the war , and was finally disbanded on 30 June 1947 . Colonel Sybil Irving commanded the AWAS from September 1941 until 1947 . In total some 35,000 women served in the Army , making up about 5 percent of the force . = = Campaigns = = = = = North Africa = = = During the first years of World War II , Australia 's military strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom 's imperial defence policy . The Singapore strategy , which seemingly negated the need for large-scale land forces in the Pacific , was a key component of this policy and consequently most Australian military units that were deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed an integral part of the Commonwealth forces in the area . The three AIF infantry divisions dispatched to the Middle East were subsequently heavily involved in the fighting that followed . In addition to the force which was sent to North Africa , two AIF brigades ( the 18th and 25th ) were stationed in Britain from June 1940 to January 1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would have responded to any German landings . An Australian Army forestry group also served in Britain between 1940 and 1943 . The Australian Army first saw action in Operation Compass , the successful Commonwealth offensive in North Africa which was conducted between December 1940 and February 1941 . Although the 6th Division was not fully equipped , it had completed its training and on 14 December , it relieved the 4th Indian Division . Given the task of capturing Italian fortresses bypassed by the British 7th Armoured Division during its advance , on 3 January , the division went into action at Bardia . Although the fortress was manned by a larger force , the Australian infantry quickly penetrated the Italian defensive lines with the support of British tanks and artillery . The majority of the defenders surrendered on 5 January and the Australians took 40,000 prisoners . The 6th Division followed up this success by assaulting the fortress of Tobruk on 21 January , securing it the next day and taking 25,000 Italians prisoner . After this , the Australians pushed west along the coast road to Cyrenaica and captured Benghazi on 4 February . Later that month , the 6th Division was withdrawn for deployment to Greece and was replaced by the untested 9th Division , which took up garrison duties in Cyrenaica . In the last week of March 1941 , a German-led force launched an offensive in Cyrenaica . The Allied forces in the area were rapidly forced to withdraw towards Egypt . The 9th Division formed the rear guard of this withdrawal , and on 6 April was ordered to defend the important port town of Tobruk for at least two months . Sustained by the Australian destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet , during the ensuing siege the 9th Division , reinforced by the 7th Division 's 18th Brigade as well as British artillery and armoured regiments , used fortifications , aggressive patrolling and artillery to contain and defeat repeated German armoured and infantry attacks . In September and October 1941 , upon the request of the Australian Government , the 9th Division was relieved and the bulk withdrawn from Tobruk . The 2 \/ 13th Battalion , however , was forced to remain until the siege was lifted in December as the convoy evacuating it was attacked . The defence of Tobruk cost the Australian units involved 3,009 casualties , including 832 killed and 941 taken prisoner . = = = Greece , Crete and Lebanon = = = In early 1941 the 6th Division and I Corps headquarters took part in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion . The corps ' commander , Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey , and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky , but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat . The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and the defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans . Australian troops arrived in Greece during March and manned defensive positions in the north of the country alongside British , New Zealand and Greek units . The outnumbered Allied force was not able to halt the Germans when they invaded on 6 April and was forced to retreat . The Australians and other Allied units conducted a fighting withdrawal from their initial positions and were evacuated from southern Greece between 24 April and 1 May . Australian warships also formed part of the force which protected the evacuation and embarked hundreds of soldiers from Greek ports . The 6th Division suffered heavy casualties in this campaign , with 320 men killed and 2,030 captured . While most of the 6th Division returned to Egypt , the 19th Brigade Group and two provisional infantry battalions landed at Crete where they formed a key part of the island 's defences . The 19th Brigade was initially successful in holding its positions when German paratroopers landed on 20 May , but was gradually forced to retreat . After several key airfields were lost the Allies evacuated the island 's garrison . Approximately 3,000 Australians , including the entire 2 \/ 7th Battalion , could not be evacuated , and were taken prisoner . As a result of its heavy casualties the 6th Division required substantial reinforcements and equipment before it was again ready for combat . The 7th Division , reinforced by the 6th Division 's 17th Brigade , formed a key part of the Allied ground forces during the Syria \u2013 Lebanon campaign which was fought against Vichy French forces in June and July 1941 . With close air support from the RAAF and the Royal Air Force , the Australian force entered Lebanon on 8 June and advanced along the coast road and Litani River valley . Although little resistance had been expected , the Vichy forces mounted a strong defence which made good use of the mountainous terrain . After the Allied attack became bogged down reinforcements were brought in and the Australian I Corps headquarters took command of the operation on 18 June . These changes enabled the Allies to overwhelm the French forces and the 7th Division entered Beirut on 12 July . The loss of Beirut and a British breakthrough in Syria led the Vichy commander to seek an armistice and the campaign ended on 13 July . = = = El Alamein = = = In the second half of 1941 the Australian I Corps was concentrated in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East . Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the corps , including the 6th and 7th Divisions , returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia . The Australian Government agreed to requests from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain 's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73 squadrons . The Government did not intend that the 9th Division would play a major role in active fighting , and it was not sent any further reinforcements . In mid-1942 , the Axis forces defeated the Commonwealth force in Libya and advanced into north-west Egypt . In June the British Eighth Army made a stand just over 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) west of Alexandria , at the railway siding of El Alamein and the 9th Division was brought forward to reinforce this position . The lead elements of the division arrived at El Alamein on 6 July and it was assigned the most northerly section of the Commonwealth defensive line . From that position , the 9th Division subsequently played a significant role in the First Battle of El Alamein , helping to halt the Axis advance . Casualties were heavy , and the 2 \/ 28th Battalion was forced to surrender on 27 July when it was surrounded by German armour after capturing Ruin Ridge . Following this battle the division remained at the northern end of the El Alamein line and launched diversionary attacks during the Battle of Alam el Halfa in early September . In October 1942 , the 9th Division and the RAAF squadrons in the area took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein . After a lengthy period of preparation , the Eighth Army launched its major offensive on 23 October . The 9th Division was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle , and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced 2nd New Zealand Division to decisively break though the Axis lines on the night of 1 \/ 2 November . The 9th Division suffered a high number of casualties during this battle and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces . During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as it was not possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain it , and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November . The 9th Division left Egypt for Australia in January 1943 , ending the AIF 's involvement in the war in North Africa . = = = Malaya and Singapore = = = Due to the emphasis placed on cooperation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940 . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941 , while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island . An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul , and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon . Meanwhile , in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain in order to protect the airfield , while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland , Vila in the New Hebrides , Tulagi on Guadalcanal , Buka Passage in Bougainville , and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers . In December 1941 the Australian Army in the Pacific consisted of the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia , including the 1st Armoured Division . In keeping with the Singapore strategy , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . At the outbreak of war the Australian forces in Malaya consisted of two brigade groups from the 8th Division \u2014 the 22nd and 27th Brigades \u2014 under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett , along with four RAAF squadrons and eight warships . Following the Japanese invasion on 8 December 1941 , the 8th Division and its attached Indian Army units was assigned responsibility for the defence of Johore in the south of Malaya . As a result , it did not see action until mid-January 1942 when Japanese spearheads first reached the state , having pushed back the British and Indian units defending the northern parts of the peninsula . By this time , the division 's two brigades had been split up , with the 22nd having been deployed around Mersing and Endau on the east coast and the 27th in the west . The division 's first engagement came on the west coast around Muar on 14 January , where the Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army was able to outflank the Commonwealth positions due to Bennett misdeploying the forces under his command so that the weak Indian 45th Brigade was assigned the crucial coastal sector and the stronger Australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas . While the Commonwealth forces in Johore achieved a number of local tactical victories , most notably around Gemas , Bakri and Jemaluang , they were unable to do more than slow the Japanese advance and suffered heavy casualties in doing so . After being outmanoeuvred by the Japanese , the remaining Commonwealth units withdrew to Singapore on the night of 30 \u2013 31 January . Following this the 8th Division was deployed to defend Singapore 's north-west coast . Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division 's units were at half-strength , and the replacements that had been received \u2014 a draft of about 1,900 replacements was sent in late January \u2014 were barely trained , some having as little as two weeks ' training in Australia before being dispatched . Assigned larger-than-normal frontages to defend along beaches that were ill-suited for defence , the 22nd and 27th Brigades were spread thin on the ground with large gaps in their lines . The commander of the Singapore fortress , Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival , believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector . Nevertheless , on 8 February the Japanese landed in the Australian sector , and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting . A subsequent landing took place at Kranji , but the division was unable to turn this back and subsequently withdrew to the centre of the island . After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore , Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February . Although some Australians were able to escape , following the capitulation 14,972 Australians were taken prisoner . Bennett was among those that managed to get out , having left the island the night before the surrender via sampan after handing over command of his division to Brigadier Cecil Callaghan . He later justified his actions saying that he had gained an understanding of how to defeat the Japanese and needed to return to Australia to pass his knowledge on , but two post-war inquiries found that he was unjustified in leaving his command . The loss of almost a quarter of Australia 's overseas soldiers and the failure of the Singapore strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain , stunned the country . The fall of Singapore raised fears of a Japanese invasion of the Australian mainland and the Government became concerned about the Army 's ability to respond . Although large , the forces in Australia contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility . In response , most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Australian Prime Minister , John Curtin , appealed to the United States for assistance . As Japanese forces advanced through Burma towards India in early 1942 , the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions while they were en route to Australia , but Curtin refused to authorise this movement . As a compromise the 16th and 17th Brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island 's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942 . = = = Netherlands East Indies and Rabaul = = = While Australia 's contribution to the pre-war plans to defend South East Asia from Japanese aggression was focused on the defence of Malaya and Singapore , small Australian forces were also deployed to defend several islands to the north of Australia . The role of these forces was to defend strategic airfields which could be used to launch attacks on the Australian mainland . Detachments of coastwatchers were also stationed in the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands to report on any Japanese operations there . At the start of the Pacific War the strategic port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by \" Lark Force \" , which comprised the 2 \/ 22nd Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron . While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military , it was not possible to reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942 . The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle . Few members of Lark Force survived the war , as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057 Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan , the transport Montevideo Maru , was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942 . AIF troops were also dispatched from Darwin to the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) in the first weeks of the Pacific War . Reinforced battalions from the 8th Division 's third brigade , the 23rd , were sent to Koepang in West Timor as part of \" Sparrow Force \" and to the island of Ambon as \" Gull Force \" to defend these strategic locations from Japanese attack . The 2 \/ 2nd Independent Company was also sent to Dili in Portuguese Timor in violation of Portugal 's neutrality . The force at Ambon was defeated by the Japanese landing on 30 January and surrendered on 3 February 1942 . Over 300 Australian prisoners were subsequently killed by Japanese troops in a series of mass executions during February . While the force at Koepang was defeated after the Japanese landed there on 20 February and also surrendered , Australian commandos waged a guerrilla campaign against the Japanese in Portuguese Timor until February 1943 . In the lead-up to the Japanese invasion of Java a force of 242 carrier- and land-based aircraft attacked Darwin on 19 February 1942 . At the time Darwin was an important base for Allied warships and a staging point for shipping supplies and reinforcements into the NEI . The Japanese attack was successful , and resulted in the deaths of 251 civilians and military personnel , most of whom were non-Australian Allied seamen , and heavy damage to RAAF Base Darwin and the town 's port facilities . A 3,000-strong Army unit , as well as several Australian warships and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March 1942 . An Army force made up of elements from the 7th Division also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command ( ABDACOM ) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12 March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate . Following the conquest of the NEI , the Japanese Navy 's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean , attacking Ceylon in early April . The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon at the time of the raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate . = = = Defence of Australia = = = Japan 's rapid advance south had been unexpected , and the perceived threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military . By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions , three armoured divisions and hundreds of other units . Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps , which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively . However , Australia 's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed , and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 . Despite Australian fears , the Japanese never intended to invade the Australian mainland . While an invasion was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942 , it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military 's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken . Instead , in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa and New Caledonia . Yet this plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway . While these battles ended the threat to Australia , the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943 . A series of Japanese air raids against northern Australia occurred during 1942 and 1943 , and while the main defence was provided by RAAF and Allied fighters , a number of Australian Army anti-aircraft batteries were also involved in dealing with this threat . Meanwhile , in 1942 the Australian military was reinforced by units recalled from the Middle East and an expansion of the Militia and RAAF . United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea , and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander , General Douglas MacArthur . After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942 , with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943 . From 1944 the Australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations , but continued to conduct large-scale operations until the end of the war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time . = = = Papuan campaign = = = Japanese forces first landed on the mainland of New Guinea on 8 March 1942 when they invaded Lae and Salamaua to secure bases for the defence of the important base they were developing at Rabaul . In response , Australian guerrillas from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles established observation posts around the Japanese beachheads and the 2 \/ 5th Independent Company successfully raided Salamaua on 29 June . After the Battle of the Coral Sea frustrated the Japanese plan to capture Port Moresby via an amphibious landing , they attempted to capture the town by landing Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii 's South Seas Force at Buna on the north coast of Papua and advancing overland using the Kokoda Track to cross the rugged Owen Stanley Range . The Kokoda Track campaign began on 22 July when the Japanese began their advance , opposed by an ill-prepared Militia brigade designated \" Maroubra Force \" . This force was successful in delaying the South Seas Force but was unable to halt it . In late August and early September 1942 Australian forces at Milne Bay inflicted the first notable land defeat of the war upon the Japanese . After the Japanese landed a unit of Special Naval Landing Forces to capture the airbases that the Allies had established in the area , two brigades of Australian troops \u2014 the Militia 7th and AIF 18th \u2014 designated \" Milne Force \" , supported by two RAAF fighter squadrons and US Army engineers , launched a counter-attack . Outnumbered , lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties , the Japanese were forced to withdraw . The victory helped raise Allied morale across the Pacific Theatre , especially on the Kokoda Track where the Japanese had continued to make progress throughout August . On 26 August two AIF battalions from the 7th Division reinforced the remnants of Maroubra Force but the Japanese continued to advance along the Kokoda Track and by 16 September they reached the village of Ioribaiwa near Port Moresby . After several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses , the Japanese troops were within 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) of Port Moresby . Yet supply problems made any further advance impossible , and the Japanese began to fear an Allied counter-landing at Buna . Following reverses at the hands of US forces on Guadalcanal the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decided they could not support fronts on both New Guinea and Guadalcanal . Horii was subsequently ordered to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided . After this , the Australian forces were heavily reinforced by the 7th Division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit , often forcibly , to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel , the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track . In early November , they had been forced into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua . Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November 1942 . The Allied force consisted of the exhausted 7th Division and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32nd Infantry Division , and was short of artillery and supplies . Due to a lack of supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey 's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications . These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943 . Throughout the fighting in Papua , most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered . In response , for the remainder of the war Australian soldiers generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel and aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents including some that had surrendered . Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea . Meanwhile , during the fighting in 1942 \u2013 43 the Australian Army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over the Japanese in jungle warfare . The Papuan campaign led to a significant reform in the composition of the Australian Army . During the campaign , the restriction banning Militia personnel from serving outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and Militia . In late 1942 and early 1943 Curtin overcame opposition within the Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the South West Pacific and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943 . This made deploying the Militia easier , but ultimately only one brigade , the 11th , was dispatched outside of Australian territory , being deployed to Merauke on the south coast of Dutch West Papua in the NEI during 1943 and 1944 as part of \" Merauke Force \" . = = = New Guinea offensives = = = After halting the Japanese advance , Allied forces went on the offensive across the SWPA from mid-1943 . Australian forces played a key role throughout this offensive , which was designated Operation Cartwheel . In particular , Blamey oversaw a series of highly successful operations around the north-east tip of New Guinea which \" was the high point of Australia 's experience of operational level command \" during the war . After the successful defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943 . This advance was mounted to divert attention from Lae , which was one of the main objectives of Operation Cartwheel , and proceeded slowly . In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team , which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua . The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943 . In early September 1943 Australian-led forces mounted a pincer movement to capture Lae . On 4 September the 9th Division made an amphibious landing to the east of the town and began advancing to the west . The following day , the US 503rd Parachute Regiment made an unopposed parachute drop at Nadzab , just west of Lae . Once the airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield , the 7th Division was flown in and began advancing to the east in a race with the 9th Division to capture Lae . This race was won by the 7th Division , which captured the town on 15 September . The Japanese forces at Salamaua and Lae suffered heavy losses during this campaign , but were able to escape to the north . After the fall of Lae the 9th Division was given the task of capturing the Huon Peninsula . The 20th Brigade landed near the strategic harbour of Finschhafen on 22 September 1943 and secured the area . The Japanese responded by dispatching the 20th Division overland to the area and the remainder of the 9th Division was gradually brought in to reinforce the 20th Brigade against the expected counter-attack . The Japanese mounted a strong attack in mid-October which was defeated by the 9th Division after heavy fighting . During the second half of November the 9th Division captured the hills inland of Finschhafen from well dug in Japanese forces . Following its defeat , the 20th Division retreated along the coast with the 9th Division and 4th Brigade in pursuit . While the 9th Division secured the coastal region of the Huon Peninsula the 7th Division drove the Japanese from the inland Finisterre Range . The Finisterre Range campaign began on 17 September when the 2 \/ 6th Independent Company was air-landed in the Markham Valley . The company defeated a larger Japanese force at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to fly in the division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January 1944 the division began its attack on the key Shaggy Ridge position . The ridge was taken by the end of the month , with the RAAF playing a key supporting role . Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from Saidor on 21 April and secured Madang on 24 April . = = = Advance to the Philippines = = = The Australian military 's role in the South-West Pacific decreased during 1944 as US forces took over responsibility for the main Allied effort in the region . In the latter half of 1943 the Australian Government decided , with MacArthur 's agreement , that the size of the military would be decreased to release manpower for war-related industries which were important to supplying Britain and US forces in the Pacific . Australia 's main role in the Allied war effort from this point forward was supplying the other Allied countries with food , materials and manufactured goods needed for the defeat of Japan . As a result of this policy , the size of the Army was reduced from late 1943 onwards , though an offensive force of six infantry divisions ( three AIF and three Militia divisions ) was maintained until the end of the war . In early 1944 all but two of the Army 's divisions were withdrawn to the Atherton Tableland for training and rehabilitation . However , several new battalions of Australian-led Papuan and New Guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into the Pacific Islands Regiment . These troops had earlier seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign , and they largely replaced the Australian Army battalions disbanded during the year . While the Australian Government offered I Corps for use in Leyte and Luzon , nothing came of several proposals to utilise it in the liberation of these islands . The Army 's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern , and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if it could not be used for offensive operations . This was politically embarrassing for the government , and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be used . It also impacted upon the Army 's morale ; as the Allies advanced further towards Japan , the Army was increasingly relegated to \" second string \" roles , despite having fought \" above its weight \" for most of the war . = = = Mopping up in New Guinea and the Solomons = = = In late 1944 , the Australian Government committed twelve Australian Army brigades to replace six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville , New Britain and the Aitape \u2013 Wewak area in New Guinea in order to free up the American units for operations in the Philippines . While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions , their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy the remaining Japanese forces in these areas . The value of these campaigns was controversial at the time and remains so to this day as the Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political , rather than military , reasons . It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia 's influence in its region . Critics of these campaigns , such as author Peter Charlton , argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective . The 5th Division replaced the US 40th Infantry Division on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the New Britain campaign with the goals of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul . In late November the 5th Division established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau . The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay at the base of the Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas . By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force 's aggressive patrolling . The 5th Division suffered 53 fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign . After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong , which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain . The II Corps continued the Bougainville campaign after it replaced the US Army 's XIV Corps between October and December 1944 . The corps consisted of the 3rd Division , 11th Brigade and Fiji Infantry Regiment on Bougainville and the 23rd Brigade which garrisoned neighbouring islands and was supported by RAAF , Royal New Zealand Air Force and United States Marine Corps air units . While the XIV Corps had maintained a defensive posture , the Australians conducted offensive operations aimed at destroying the Japanese force on Bougainville . As the Japanese were split into several enclaves the II Corps fought separate offensives in the northern , central and southern portions of the island . The main focus was against the Japanese base at Buin in the south , and the offensives in the north and centre of the island were largely suspended from May 1945 . While Australian operations on Bougainville continued until the end of the war , large Japanese forces remained at Buin and in the north of the island . The 6th Division was assigned responsibility for completing the destruction of the Japanese Eighteenth Army , which was the last large Japanese force remaining in the Australian portion of New Guinea . Supported by several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships , the division was reinforced by Militia and armoured units and began arriving at Aitape in October 1944 . In late 1944 the Australians launched a two-pronged offensive to the east towards Wewak . The 17th Brigade advanced inland through the Torricelli Mountains while the remainder of the division moved along the coast . Although the Eighteenth Army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease , it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties . The 6th Division 's advance was also hampered by supply difficulties and bad weather . The Australians secured the coastal area by early May , and Wewak was captured on 10 May after a small force was landed east of the town . By the end of the war the Eighteenth Army had been forced into what it had designated its \" last stand \" area . The Aitape \u2013 Wewak campaign cost 442 Australian lives while about 9,000 Japanese died and another 269 were taken prisoner . = = = Borneo campaign = = = The Borneo campaign of 1945 was the last major Allied campaign in the South West Pacific . In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July , the Australian I Corps , under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead , attacked Japanese forces occupying the island . Allied naval and air forces , centred on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and the US Thirteenth Air Force , also played important roles in the campaign . The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo 's oilfields and Brunei Bay to support the US-led invasion of Japan and British-led liberation of Malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945 . The Australian Government did not agree to MacArthur 's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July 1945 , however , and its decision not to release the 6th Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead . The campaign opened on 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group landed on the small island of Tarakan off the east coast of Borneo to secure the island 's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan . While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip , intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June . As a result , the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile . The next phase began on 10 June when the 9th Division conducted simultaneous assaults in north-west Labuan and on the coast of Brunei . While Brunei was quickly secured , the Japanese garrison on Labuan held out for over a week . After the Brunei Bay region was secured the 24th Brigade was landed in North Borneo and the 20th Brigade advanced along the western coast of Borneo south from Brunei . Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance and most of north-west Borneo was liberated by the end of the war . During the campaign the 9th Division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces such as Z Special Unit . The third and final stage of the campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of Borneo . This operation had been opposed by Blamey , who believed that it was unnecessary , but went ahead on the orders of MacArthur . After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July . Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 July but mopping up continued until the end of the war as isolated pockets of Japanese resistance remained . The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World War II . Although the Borneo campaign was criticised in Australia at the time , and in subsequent years , as pointless or a waste of soldiers ' lives , it did achieve a number of objectives , such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the NEI , capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war , who were being held in deteriorating conditions . = = = Post-war years = = = Prior to the end of the war on 15 August 1945 , the Australian military was preparing to contribute forces to the invasion of Japan . Australia 's participation in this operation would have involved elements of all three services fighting as part of Commonwealth forces . It was planned to form a new 10th Division from existing AIF personnel which would form part of the Commonwealth Corps with British , Canadian and New Zealand units . The corps ' organisation was to be identical to that of a US Army corps , and it would have participated in the invasion of the Japanese home island of Honsh\u016b which was scheduled for March 1946 under Operation Coronet . Planning for operations against Japan ceased in August 1945 when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Japanese field commanders subsequently surrendered to Allied forces across the Pacific Theatre and Australian forces accepted the surrender of their Japanese opponents at ceremonies conducted at Morotai , several locations in Borneo , Timor , Wewak , Rabaul , Bougainville and Nauru . Following the surrender the Australian Army faced a number of immediate operational and administrative issues , including the need to maintain security in the areas it occupied , the disarming and administration of surrendered Japanese forces in these areas , organising the return of approximately 177,000 soldiers ( including prisoners of war ) to Australia , the demobilisation and discharge of the bulk of the soldiers serving in the Army , and the raising of an occupation force for service in Japan . Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender . Under the terms of an agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten , the head of South East Asia Command , Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo , the NEI east of Lombok ( including western New Guinea ) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific . The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945 . I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI , and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea . After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI . While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists , the Australians were careful to not become involved in the Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible . Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good , due in part to the decision by the Waterside Workers ' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI . The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946 . The Australian Army also contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . Volunteers for this force were recruited in late 1945 , with most being assigned to three new infantry battalions : the 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division , the 66th Battalion by men from the 6th Division and the 67th from 9th Division personnel . These and other units were grouped at Morotai as the 34th Brigade in October 1945 . The brigade 's departure for Japan was delayed until February 1946 by inter-Allied negotiations , but it eventually took over responsibility for enforcing the terms of the Japanese surrender in Hiroshima Prefecture . The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion . Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsular following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 . = = Leadership = = When the war began the Army was on the cusp of a generational change . At the time , the senior officers on the active list were Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Thomas Blamey , although Bennett had not held an appointment for seven years and Blamey for the last two . Then came the Chief of the General Staff , Major General John Lavarack ; the Adjutant General , Major General Sir Carl Jess ; Major General Owen Phillips , the Quartermaster General ; Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman , the commander of the 3rd Division ; and Major General Iven Mackay , the commander 2nd Division . All were over 50 years of age and all except Bennett , Drake-Brockman and Mackay were serving or former regular soldiers . Only the first three were considered to command the 6th Division and Second AIF , for which posts Blamey was selected by Prime Minister Menzies . Both Blamey and Lavarack were promoted to lieutenant general on 13 October 1939 . Blamey was subsequently appointed General Officer Commanding ( GOC ) I Corps following its raising in March 1940 , while Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division and Lavarack assumed command of the newly formed 7th Division . The next most senior regular officers , all colonels , included men like Vernon Sturdee , Henry Wynter and John Northcott , all of whom had joined the Army before World War I. These officers held senior commands throughout the war , but seldom active ones . Below them were a distinct group of regular officers , graduates of the Royal Military College , Duntroon , which had opened in 1911 . Their number included Frank Berryman , William Bridgeford , Cyril Clowes , Horace Robertson , Sydney Rowell and George Alan Vasey . These officers had fought in World War I and reached the rank of major , but their promotion prospects were restricted and they remained majors for twenty years . Many left the Army to join the British or Indian armies , or the RAAF , or to return to civilian life . As a group , they had become embittered and resentful , and determined to prove that they could lead troops in battle . Many regular officers had attended training courses or been on exchange with the British Army , which was important in the early years of the war when there was close cooperation between the two armies . Between the wars , the reservists enjoyed much better promotion prospects . While Alan Vasey , a major in the First AIF , was not promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel until 1937 , Kenneth Eather , a reservist who was too young to serve in World War I , was commissioned in 1923 and promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935 . Menzies ordered that all commands in the 6th Division be given to reservists rather than regular officers , who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to the Singapore strategy . Appointments therefore went to reservists like Stanley Savige , Arthur Allen , Leslie Morshead and Edmund Herring . Later other Militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders . The distinguished records of officers like Heathcote Hammer , Ivan Dougherty , David Whitehead , Victor Windeyer and Selwyn Porter would challenge the regular officers ' contention that they had a special claim to senior command ability . At the start of the war , the majority of battalion commands went to older reservists , many of whom had commanded battalions or served in the First AIF . As the war went on , the average age of battalion commanders declined from 42.9 years old in 1940 to 35.6 in 1945 . The prevalence of regular officers in senior positions also rose , and in 1945 they held half of all senior appointments . They remained under-represented in unit commands , and , as in 1940 , there was still only one infantry battalion commanded by a regular officer . Following the outbreak of war with Japan , many senior officers with distinguished records in the Middle East were recalled to Australia to lead Militia formations and fill important staff posts as the Army expanded . The following year , though , the Army reached its greatest extent after which it shrank in size . With a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than required , Blamey faced public and political criticism after he \" shelved \" several senior officers . The career prospects of junior officer were also affected , particularly in the infantry . Of the 52 officers promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in the last six months of 1944 only five were infantrymen , while two were engineers , and 45 were from the supporting arms . Meanwhile , the return of the AIF divisions to Australia from the Middle East in 1942 coincided with the arrival of large numbers of American troops , including the US 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions . From April 1942 MacArthur took over command of all US and Australian forces in the newly formed South West Pacific Area as Supreme Commander . Blamey had been appointed Commander-in-Chief AMF in March following his promotion to general , setting up Land Headquarters to subsume the role of the Military Board , which was suspended on 30 July . As Commander-in-Chief AMF he reported directly to MacArthur and was subsequently also given command of Allied Land Forces in the theatre . Yet although Australian forces made up the bulk of the Allied forces in SWPA until 1944 in practice for political reasons MacArthur ensured that Blamey only commanded Australian forces , while he also limited the number of Australian staff officers posted to General Headquarters , and they remained underrepresented for the remainder of the war . = = Equipment = = The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN , which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period . The result was that when war came in 1939 , the Army 's equipment was of World War I vintage , and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms . Most equipment was obsolescent and had to be replaced , and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons , equipment and motor vehicles . Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division , but since a division 's war establishment was around 3,000 , this was only enough for training . In February 1940 , the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for sending them to the Middle East for wheat cargoes . Throughout the war , Australian infantry units were largely equipped with British-designed but Australian-made small arms and support weapons . The standard rifle was the SMLE No 1 Mk III * , manufactured since 1912 at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory . Small quantities of the Lee \u2013 Enfield No.4 Mk I \/ Mk I * rifle , made by the Long Branch Arsenal in Canada and Savage-Stevens Firearms in the US , were used in New Guinea although most of these rifles were provided to other branches of the Australian military and to the Volunteer Defence Corps in order to free up No.1 MkIII * rifles for frontline infantry units . American-made M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles and M1 carbines were also issued to some Australian infantry units attached to US Army formations in New Guinea . Direct fire support was provided by a mixture of machine guns , including the Vickers machine gun which was produced at Lithgow from 1929 , which were utilised by specialised machine-gun battalions and , later , also medium machine-gun platoons within infantry battalions . The Bren Gun replaced Lewis Gun as the standard automatic rifle in the early years of the war , and within infantry battalions was utilised at the section level . Their manufacture in Australia started in 1941 . To improve rates of fire , the American Thompson submachine gun was introduced but it was eventually replaced by the Australian-designed Owen Gun and the British-designed but Australian-modified and -made Austen submachine gun . Infantry platoons were also equipped with M36 grenades . The Boys anti-tank rifle was the standard infantry anti-tank weapon at the start of the war , but was replaced with the PIAT in 1943 . The heavier support weapons used by infantry battalions the war included the 2-inch mortar and Stokes 3-inch mortar . Infantry battalions were also equipped with Universal Carriers until being converted to the tropical warfare establishment in 1943 , when the organic carrier platoons were consolidated into companies assigned at divisional level . A man-pack flamethrower was also introduced in 1945 . Not until 17 January 1940 did Richard Casey obtain Cabinet 's approval to spend \u00a3 400,000 to construct a plant to manufacture 25 pounder field guns and 2 pounder anti-tank guns . Until the 25 pounder could become available in quantity , units in Australia and the Far East were equipped with the old 18 pounder . Some units in the Middle East operated the 18 \/ 25 pounder , an 18 pounder that had been re-bored to take 25 pounder ammunition , until they received British 25 pounders . The old 4.5 inch howitzer also saw service , with the 2 \/ 10th Field Regiment employing them in support of the 9th Division during the Siege of Tobruk . A collection of captured Italian guns , known as the \" Bush Artillery \" , were also employed . These were rendered obsolete when the 25 pounder became available in quantity . Eventually , 1,527 were manufactured in Australia . A special light weight version known as the Short 25 pounder was developed for jungle warfare . The requirement for a portable field piece in mountainous jungle led to the use of the 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer in the New Guinea campaign . The American 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 was also employed . Experience in the Western Desert campaign soon showed that the 2 pounder could not deal with German tanks , and it was superseded by the 6 pounder , which began coming off the assembly lines in Australia in July 1942 . In turn it was replaced in 1944 by the 17 pounder , which was manufactured at the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory . The anti-aircraft artillery were equipped with the Swedish-designed Bofors 40 mm gun , which was manufactured in Australia , and the British 3.7 inch Anti-Aircraft gun . Medium artillery included the American 155 mm Long Tom and the British 5.5 inch gun . The need for tanks to equip armoured units led the War Cabinet to approve the manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940 . Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943 , but none were used in action . Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas . A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941 , while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942 , and these proved to be the most suitable type for jungle warfare . A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign . The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee . Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions , but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas , they did not see action . An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944 . The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors . The Australian Army developed its own landing craft . Development of an Australian version of the Landing Craft Assault , the ALCV ( Australian Landing Craft , Vehicle ) , was carried out by Army personnel working alongside the Ford Motor Company . Prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on the Brisbane River . The initial version , known as the ALCV I was found to be too small , so the larger 12-metre ALCV II was developed . An Australian version of the Landing Craft Mechanized , the ALCM , was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong . Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger landing craft , so the ALCV III , an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the cargo capacity , was produced . The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs , a type of similar capacity to an American Landing Craft Tank , with five Ford V8 engines . Only four were delivered before the end of the war , but they arrived in time to see service in New Guinea . By 1945 , due to a shrinking number of operational units and stepped up production , equipment shortages were a thing of the past . Indeed , the Army had more equipment that it actually needed . For example , a total of 368 25 pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand . Additionally , a total of 530 2 pounder and 6 pounder anti-tank guns were required , but the Army had 1,941 , while 68 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training , but there were 640 pieces available . Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren , of which 9,438 were required , but there were 21,139 in the system . The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required , due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare . = = Training and doctrine = = The Australian Army 's pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment . This doctrine and the supporting training manuals were common to those of all Commonwealth countries . Following the outbreak of war the Army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in Europe and North Africa . By far the single greatest difficulty in training in the early war years was the shortage of equipment . However , there were also critical shortages of instructors . The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel , but there were few officers and men with the required skills in the small pre-war Army and many of them were already serving in the AIF 's divisional mechanised cavalry regiments . An Armoured Fighting Vehicles School was created at Puckapunyal , Victoria , in 1941 , and in March 1943 , the Armoured Corps Training Centre was moved there . Another problem for the Militia was a lack of continuity in the training . When the war began , men were called up for only one month 's additional training . This was then increased to three months ' additional training . In 1940 \u2013 41 , officers and non-commissioned officers were intensively trained for 18 to 24 days , after which there was a camp for 70 days . Meanwhile , soldiers who had been through the 90-day training regimen in 1939 \u2013 40 were given 12 days ' additional training , while those who had not completed this training undertook 70 days . This allowed for individual training , but prevented proper unit training . In July 1941 , fully trained soldiers who had completed 90 days ' training became liable for three months ' additional training per year while new recruits were liable for six months . At the same time , the War Cabinet provided for more intensive training for the full-time cadre of Militia units , which were not to exceed 25 percent of the unit 's strength . Training for the Militia and the VDC was also hampered in the early war years by a lack of small arms , particularly after the Dunkirk evacuation when Australia dispatched its reserve stock of rifles to Britain , in an effort to help replace equipment lost by the British Army , amidst concerns of an invasion of the United Kingdom after the Fall of France . Although the Army 's focus was on conventional warfare , in late 1940 Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood , a British officer , arrived in Australia with a small specialist staff to conduct training in unconventional warfare . A school , known as No. 7 Infantry Training Centre , was opened at Wilsons Promontory , Victoria , which was described as \" an isolated area of high , rugged and heavily timbered mountains , precipitous valleys , swiftly running streams , and swamps . \" The 1st , 2nd and 3rd Independent Companies and a nucleus of the 4th were raised by October 1941 when training was discontinued . After the outbreak of the war with Japan , the school was reopened as the Guerrilla Warfare School , the training of the fourth company was completed . These independent companies were later redesignated as commando squadrons , of which twelve were eventually raised , including the 1st , which had been destroyed early in the war ; as the war progressed they were used more in the flank protection and reconnaissance roles than for unconventional warfare . The Australian Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1942 . Some lessons were passed on by officers who escaped from Malaya and Singapore , however , and these were incorporated into a training memorandum in May that year . AIF units that returned from North Africa undertook some training in jungle tactics before going into action , but the Militia units which initially faced the Japanese in New Guinea suffered from inadequate training , and this led to them suffering heavy casualties . In order to be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly , to acclimatise them during the process , and to allow more realistic training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain , Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942 . Eventually , accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops . As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944 , they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment . The men then went on leave , after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South-West Pacific . The Army 's front-line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with this doctrine during the year . A jungle warfare school was opened at Canungra , Queensland , in November 1942 , and all reinforcements for combat units subsequently passed through the school before joining their unit . Canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre , an Independent Company training centre , and a tactical school . With the establishment of Canungra the Independent Company training centre on Wilsons Promontory was closed . Over time , training programs included greater cooperation between the Army 's combat arms and with the other services . A Combined Training Centre , also known as HMAS Assault , opened on 1 September 1942 at Nelson Bay , adjacent to Port Stephens , New South Wales , as a central establishment for the training staffs , beach parties and small boat crews . In July 1942 , a Combined Training School was established at Bribie Island , Queensland , and nearby Toorbul Point for Army units . During 1943 and 1944 , combined training with the RAAF and RAN was also carried out at Trinity Beach , near Cairns in preparation for amphibious operations in the South West Pacific as the Allies advanced . The Australian Army began training paratroops in December 1942 as an offshoot of the training of Independent Companies . The 1st Parachute Battalion was subsequently formed in March 1943 . It reached full strength by January 1944 , but , although it was warned for action a number of times , including the possible rescue of prisoners of war held at Sandakan in 1945 , it did not see any fighting . After the war it participated in the reoccupation of Singapore . By 1945 the Army possessed a comprehensive schools system , with 40 schools of various kinds . Between 1942 and 1945 96,000 training courses were conducted . Soldiers who were selected to become officers were trained at various Officer Cadet Training Units around the country , and by the end of the war these units had produced 7,887 officers . Meanwhile , regular officers of the PMF continued to be trained at the Royal Military College , Duntroon with a number of shortened courses of between six months and a years ' duration being run . Unlike the First AIF , newly commissioned lieutenants were not sent back to their original unit , but were posted to the first vacancy . Other schools included the School of Artillery , the Guerrilla Warfare School , the Cooking and Catering School , the School of Military Law and the School of Movement and Transport . Recruit training was now thorough and exacting , and for infantrymen culminated in a jungle training course at Canungra , where the Jungle Warfare School turned out 4,000 reinforcements a month . In 1945 , the 29th Brigade received 1,000 young reinforcements shortly before embarking for Torokina , but their commander later remarked that their training at Canungra had been so thorough that they \" reacted with almost miraculous quickness to conditions of battle . \" = = Prisoners of war = = Nearly 29,000 Australians were taken prisoner by the Axis during the war , the bulk of them members of the Australian Army . During the fighting in the Middle East and Greece , 7,116 Australian soldiers were taken prisoner by German and Italian forces . Of these men , 3,109 were captured at Crete and 2,065 on the mainland of Greece . Most of the other POWs were members of the 9th Division captured during the retreat from Cyrenaica in early 1941 , the siege of Tobruk or the fighting near El Alamein in mid-1942 . Like other western Allied POWs , the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany and were generally treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions . As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies . These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths . As the war drew to a close , a unit designated the AIF Reception Group ( United Kingdom ) was established near Eastbourne in England to provide accommodation and support for the POWs once they were released . By August 1945 all the former Australian POWs in Europe had embarked on ships bound for Australia . While Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in World War I , it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment . More than 21,000 members of the AIF were captured by the Japanese during the first months of 1942 . Most of these men were members of the 8th Division captured at Singapore , the NEI and Rabaul , but about 2,000 members of the I Corps party sent to Java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there . Throughout captivity these POWs were treated harshly , resulting in a high death rate . Australians were held in camps across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships . While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease , hundreds were murdered by their guards . The Burma-Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences , as 13,000 Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese ; nearly 2,650 Australians died there . Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions . The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates ; 77 percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2,500 Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived ; almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945 . Overall , only 14,000 of the Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity . The majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease . The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war . Australian authorities investigated the abuses against Allied POWs in their country 's zone of responsibility after the war , and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by Australian-administered war crimes trials . = = Demobilisation = = The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities , although it had partially commenced as early as 1943 . At the end of the war the strength of the Australian Army was 398,594 men , approximately half of which were serving overseas in the South West Pacific Area . The demobilisation plan was put into action on 16 August 1945 , the day after Japan surrendered . Undertaken in four phases , it was finally completed on 15 February 1947 by which time a total of 349,964 soldiers had been discharged . Although the process largely proceeded smoothly , many soldiers felt it was too slow and there was widespread dissatisfaction among men continuing to serve in the South West Pacific after the war ended . The speed of demobilisation was hampered by the requirement to continue to maintain security in the areas still occupied , the lack of sufficient shipping , the administrative workload entailed , and limited facilities for use for the demobilisation process . Although the Second AIF was not disbanded until 30 June 1947 a temporary organisation known as the Interim Army was established at the end of the war and included all members of the Army on full-time duty . Meanwhile , in a departure from previous defence policy the Australian government decided that a small peace-time regular force was to be raised to provide a trained , full-time force capable of being deployed either in Australia or overseas in a national emergency and the Australian Regular Army was subsequently established on 30 September 1947 . The Militia , under the guise of the Citizen Military Forces , was re-established on 1 July 1948 to provide a part-time volunteer force which would be able to provide the basis for expansion in wartime . = = Casualties = = In the course of the fighting the Australian Army sustained approximately 61,000 battle casualties , the bulk of them from the Second AIF . This included 11,323 killed in action , 1,794 died of wounds , and 21,853 wounded . 5,558 were killed or died in captivity , while another 20,920 survived as prisoners of war . Non-battle casualties included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded \/ injured in operational areas , and another 1,795 killed and 121,800 wounded \/ injured in non-operational areas . The large number of non-battle casualties was significant , illustrating the toll that sickness and disease took upon the Army .",

Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army was split into the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia. Following the outbreak of war, on 14 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force, designated the Second Australian Imperial Force ( Second AIF ), would be formed for overseas service."

        "doc": "HMS Vindictive ( 1918 ) = HMS Vindictive was a warship built during the First World War for the Royal Navy ( RN ) . Originally designed as a Hawkins-class heavy cruiser and laid down under the name Cavendish , she was converted into an aircraft carrier while still building . Renamed in 1918 , she was completed a few weeks before the end of the war and saw no active service with the Grand Fleet . The following year she participated in the British campaign in the Baltic against the Bolsheviks during which her aircraft made numerous attacks against the naval base at Kronstadt . Vindictive returned home at the end of the year and was placed in reserve for several years before her flight decks were removed and she was reconverted back into a cruiser . The ship retained her aircraft hangar and conducted trials with a aircraft catapult before she was sent to the China Station in 1926 . A year after her return in 1928 , she was again placed in reserve . Vindictive was demilitarized and converted into a training ship in 1936 \u2013 1937 . At the beginning of the Second World War she was converted into a repair ship . Her first role after the conversion was completed in early 1940 , however , was to transport troops during the Norwegian Campaign . She was then sent to the South Atlantic to support British ships serving there and , in late 1942 , to the Mediterranean to support the ships there . Vindictive returned home in 1944 and was damaged by a German torpedo off the coast of Normandy after the Allies invaded France . She was reduced to reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1946 . = = Background and description = = The Hawkins-class cruiser was designed to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas . This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders . The design was also given high freeboard to allow it to maintain its speed in heavy weather . Sir Eustace Tennyson d 'Eyncourt , the Director of Naval Construction , included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions . Four ships were ordered , named after famous Elizabethan seafarers , in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916 , named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish . By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended , so construction proceeded slowly . The cruisers had an overall length of 605 feet ( 184.4 m ) , a beam of 65 feet ( 19.8 m ) , and a mean draught of 19 feet 3 inches ( 5.9 m ) at deep load . They were designed to displace 9,750 long tons ( 9,906 t ) and had a complement of 37 officers and 672 enlisted men . The ships had four Parsons geared steam turbines , each of which drove one propeller shaft . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 60,000 shaft horsepower ( 45,000 kW ) for a speed of 30 knots ( 56 km \/ h ; 35 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by 12 Yarrow boilers ; 8 of these were oil-fired while the remaining 4 used coal . They had a stowage capacity of 800 long tons ( 810 t ) of coal and 1,600 long tons ( 1,600 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 5,400 nautical miles ( 10,000 km ; 6,200 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km \/ h ; 16 mph ) . The main armament of the Hawkins-class cruisers consisted of seven 45-calibre 7.5 in ( 190 mm ) Mk VI guns in pivot mounts . They were arranged in two superfiring pairs , one each fore and aft of the superstructure , one on each broadside abreast the rear funnel , and the last was on the quarterdeck at the same level as the lower of the rear superfiring pair ; they were designated 1 through 7 from front to rear . At maximum elevation these guns fired a 200-pound ( 91 kg ) shell to a range of 21,114 yards ( 19,307 m ) . Their secondary armament comprised a dozen quick-firing ( QF ) 3-inch 20 cwt guns . Eight of these were on low-angle mounts intended for use against torpedo boats and the remaining four were on high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defence . They also mounted two submerged tubes , one on each broadside , and four above-water tubes , two on each broadside , for 21-inch torpedoes . The Hawkins-class cruisers were protected with an armour that had a maximum thickness of 4 inches abreast the ships ' magazines and a minimum thickness of 1.5 inches ( 38 mm ) . It consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel of varying thicknesses that covered most of the ships ' sides . The decks had a maximum thickness of 1 \u2013 1.5 in ( 25 \u2013 38 mm ) over the engine rooms , boilers , and the steering gear . The conning tower and its communication tube were protected by the only Krupp cemented armour in the ships and had thicknesses of 3 inches and 2 inches ( 51 mm ) respectively . = = = Conversion into an aircraft carrier = = = In January 1917 , the Board of Admiralty reviewed the navy 's aircraft carrier requirements and decided to order two ships fitted with a flying-off deck as well as a landing deck aft . The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities , so the Admiralty decided to convert Cavendish , already under construction , in June 1917 . No. 2 7.5-inch gun , two 3-inch guns and the conning tower were removed and the forward superstructure was remodelled into a 78 by 49 feet ( 23.8 by 14.9 m ) hangar with a capacity for six reconnaissance aircraft . The hangar roof , with a small extension , formed the 106-foot ( 32 m ) flying-off deck . The aircraft were hoisted up through a hatch at the aft end of the flying-off deck by two derricks . The 193 by 57 feet ( 58.8 by 17.4 m ) landing deck required the removal of Nos. 5 and 6 7.5-inch guns and moving the four 3-inch AA guns to an elevated platform between the funnels , in lieu of the 3-inch guns intended for that position . A port side gangway 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) wide connected the landing and flying-off decks to allow aircraft with their wings folded to be wheeled from one to the other . A crash barrier was hung from \" the gallows \" at the forward end of the landing on deck . To increase her stability after the addition of so much topweight , the upper portion of her anti-torpedo bulge was enlarged . Although still overweight compared to her designed displacement , the modifications made the ship lighter than her sister ships , at 9,344 long tons ( 9,494 t ) light displacement and a metacentric height of 3.59 feet ( 1.1 m ) . She completed her sea trials on 21 September 1918 and reached a speed of 29.12 knots ( 53.93 km \/ h ; 33.51 mph ) from 63,600 shaft horsepower ( 47,400 kW ) . = = Construction and career = = Cavendish was laid down at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast on 26 June 1916 and launched on 17 January 1918 . In June she was renamed Vindictive , the fifth ship of that name in the RN , to perpetuate the name of the old protected cruiser Vindictive , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May . She commissioned on 1 October and , after briefly working up , joined the Grand Fleet 's Flying Squadron on 18 October only a few weeks before the Armistice on 11 November . For the rest of the year she conducted flying trials and exercises , including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft , of which two were lost in accidents . The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet 's last operational Sopwith Pup . Experiments conducted earlier aboard the larger Furious , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels , had demonstrated that the turbulence from these was enough to make successful landings almost impossible at high speed . Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving . Vindictive was dispatched to the Baltic with a dozen aircraft , a mix of Griffins , Sopwith 2F.1 fighters , Sopwith 1 \u00bd Strutter and Short Type 184 bombers , on 2 July 1919 to participate in the British campaign in the Baltic in support of the White Russians and the newly independent Baltic states . On 6 July she ran aground on a shoal near Reval at speed . Stuck hard in the tideless Baltic , all of her fuel was dumped overboard , and most of her ammunition as well . Some 2,200 long tons ( 2,200 t ) of stores were also off-loaded , but the ship could not be towed free by the combined efforts of the light cruisers Danae and Cleopatra and three tugboats . Eight days after grounding a fortuitous westerly wind began that raised the water level by 8 inches ( 203 mm ) , just enough to pull the ship free . Unbeknownst to the British the entire operation had taken place in a minefield . The carrier unloaded her air group , commanded by Major Grahame Donald , at Biorko , Finland on 14 July . Their airfield was still under construction , but they were able to fly a reconnaissance mission over the major Bolshevik naval base at Kronstadt on 26 July while Vindictive sailed to Copenhagen , Denmark , to load aircraft and spares left for her by the carrier Argus . Four days later , Rear Admiral Walter Cowan ordered Donald and his aircraft to attack Kronstadt at night . As their airfield was not yet finished , the ship 's flying-off deck was extended to 118 feet ( 36.0 m ) to better allow the bombers to take off with their 112-pound ( 51 kg ) bombs . Accurate anti-aircraft fire kept the aircraft too high for an effective attack , but Donald 's men claimed two hits on the submarine tender Pamiat Azova . In reality one bomb struck the oil tanker Tatiana , setting it on fire and killing one man . That same day eight RN Coastal Motor Boat ( CMB ) s arrived ; Vindictive served as their depot ship . Vindictive 's aircraft continued to support British operations against the Bolsheviks until they left the Baltic in December , although no further missions were flown from the carrier . They shot down a helium-filled observation balloon and spotted for ships conducted shore bombardments . Most importantly , nine of them attacked Kronstadt during the night of 17 \/ 18 August 1919 to provide a diversion for an attack by the CMBs on ships in Kronstadt harbour . As a result , the torpedo boats damaged the battleship Andrei Pervozvanny and sank Pamiat Azova . In subsequent attacks on Kronstadt , they nearly hit Andrei Pervozvanny while she was in drydock , nearly hit a minesweeper , killing one crewman from the explosion , and hit two auxiliary ships . By December it was clear that the Whites ' offensive against Petrograd had failed and the British began withdrawing ; Vindictive left three Camels in Latvia , embarked the rest of her aircraft and sailed for home on 22 December . She was paid off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 December and received permanent repairs of her damage from the grounding , at a cost of \u00a3 200,000 . Furious and Vindictive had proven that the idea of \" cruiser-carriers \" was unworkable due to the turbulence from their superstructures and that a complete flight deck was necessary to successfully operate aircraft at sea . The Admiralty had considered converting her to that configuration , with an island , in July 1918 while still building , but had decided to wait on the results of tests conducted with Argus evaluating different designs for the island . Vindictive was thought to be too small to be an effective carrier and the financial restrictions in place after the war vitiated against such a major reconstruction . = = = As cruiser = = = For the next several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport , until she began reconversion into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923 . The flight decks were removed and she was mostly restored to her designed configuration , although her 3-inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns . Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7.5-inch guns . The major exception was that No. 2 7.5-inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure . The two derricks that serviced the hangar were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of the hangar roof . No. 2 's position was occupied by a prototype compressed-air Carey aircraft catapult , the first British cruiser to mount a catapult . Vindictive used it for the first time on 3 October when she launched a Fairey IIID floatplane . She also conducted catapult trials on float-equipped Fairey Flycatcher fighters . She sailed for the China Station on 1 January 1926 with six Fairey IIIDs aboard for anti-piracy patrols and departed for home on 14 March 1928 . She arrived in May and her catapult was removed in October , ending her career as an aviation ship . Vindictive was again reduced to reserve in 1929 , making occasional trooping voyages . = = = As training ship = = = In 1936 \u2013 1937 , Vindictive was demilitarised in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty and converted to a training ship for cadets . Her two inboard propellers were removed as were the inboard turbines ; half of her boilers were removed and their compartments were converted into accommodations . The aft funnel was removed , the aft superstructure remodelled and enlarged and her hangar converted into more accommodation space . Her armament , including the above-water torpedo tubes , was replaced by a pair of 4.7-inch ( 120 mm ) guns forward and a quadruple QF 2-pounder ( \" pom-pom \" ) AA mount aft . In this form she displaced 9,100 long tons ( 9,200 t ) and was capable of a maximum speed of 24 knots ( 44 km \/ h ; 28 mph ) . She was recommissioned on 7 September 1937 . = = = As fleet repair ship = = = After the Second World War began in August 1939 , Vindictive was transferred to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister Effingham , with nine 6-inch ( 152 mm ) guns , four twin-gun 4-inch ( 100 mm ) mounts and a catapult . She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October , when a less complex modernisation was considered . This proposal had six 6-inch guns and three 4-inch AA guns , and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range , but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship . Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar 's roof . Her aft superstructure was extended to be flush with her sides and slightly lengthened , and a large deckhouse was built on the quarterdeck . Her armament now consisted of six single 4-inch QF Mk V AA guns , all on the centreline , two quadruple \" pom-pom \" mounts , one on each side , and six depth charges . In this role , she had a standard displacement of 10,000 long tons ( 10,000 t ) ( 12,000 long tons ( 12,000 t ) at full load ) and her draught increased to 20 feet 3 inches ( 6.2 m ) . The conversion was completed on 30 March 1940 , just in time for the ship to be used with the Home Fleet as a troop transport during the Norwegian Campaign . She ferried British troops to Narvik in late April and escorted an evacuation convoy from Harstad on 4 June . Vindictive was transferred to the South Atlantic later in the year and remained there until late 1942 , when she was ordered north . On the night of 12 November , she was attacked west of Gibraltar by the German submarine U-515 , but managed to evade the torpedoes . U-515 sank the accompanying destroyer tender Hecla and blew the stern off one of the escorting destroyers , Marne . She remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1944 , when she was recalled to support the ships participating in Operation Overlord . During this time she received her first radars . By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set as well as a Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar . By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar . Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon , three on each side of the roof of the large workshop abaft the funnel . In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons . Later that year , the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added . In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons . In early August 1944 , the ship was damaged by a long-range , circling , \" Dackel \" torpedo dropped by the Luftwaffe off the coast of Normandy . She was paid off into reserve on 8 September 1945 and was sold for scrap on 24 January 1946 . Vindictive was subsequently broken up at Blyth .",

        "doc": "Bouldering = Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses . While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever , most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds , chalk to keep their hands dry , and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls . Unlike free solo climbing , which is also performed without ropes , bouldering problems ( the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb ) are usually less than 6 meters ( 20 ft . ) tall . Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders . Bouldering competitions , which employ a variety of formats , take place in both indoor and outdoor settings . The sport originated as a method of training for roped climbs and mountaineering . Bouldering enabled climbers to practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground . Additionally , the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength . Throughout the 1900s , bouldering evolved into a separate discipline . Individual problems are assigned ratings based on their difficulty . There have been many different rating systems used throughout the history of the sport , but modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the Fontainebleau scale . The growing popularity of the sport has caused several environmental concerns , including soil erosion and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off-trail to reach bouldering sites . This has caused some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether . = = Overview = = Bouldering is a form of rock climbing which takes place on boulders and other small rock formations , usually measuring less than 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) from ground to top , but in some cases can measure up to 30 + ft . Unlike top rope climbing and lead climbing , no ropes are used to protect or aid the climber . Bouldering routes or \" problems \" require the climber to reach the top of a boulder , usually from a specified start position . Some boulder problems , known as \" traverses , \" require the climber to climb horizontally from one position to another . The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed . Granite , for example , often features long cracks and slabs . Sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks . Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock . There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States , including Hueco Tanks in Texas , Mount Evans in Colorado , and The Buttermilks in Bishop , California . Squamish , British Columbia is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada . Europe also hosts a number of bouldering sites , such as Fontainebleau in France , Albarrac\u00edn in Spain , and various mountains throughout Switzerland . = = = Indoor bouldering = = = Artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment , usually at climbing gyms . These walls are constructed with wooden panels , polymer cement panels , concrete shells , or precast molds of actual rock walls . Holds , usually made of plastic , are then bolted onto the wall to create problems . The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces , forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength . Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall . In the US the most common method Routesetters use to designate the intended route for a particular problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold \u2014 for example , holds with red tape would indicate one bouldering problem , while green tape would be used to set off a different problem in the same area . Across much of the rest of the world problems and grades are usually designated by using a set color of plastic hold to indicate a particular problem . For example , green may be v0-v1 , blue may be v2-v3 and so on . Setting via color has certain advantages , the most notable of which are that it makes it more obvious where the holds for a problem are , and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off of footholds . Smaller , resource-poor climbing gyms may prefer taped problems because large , expensive holds can be used in multiple routes simply by marking them with more than one color of tape . = = = Competitions = = = Bouldering competitions occur in both indoor and outdoor settings . The International Federation of Sport Climbing ( IFSC ) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds : qualifications , semi-finals , and finals . The rounds feature different sets of four or five boulder problems , and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem . At the end of each round , competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems , with ties settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the problems . There are several other formats used for bouldering competitions . Some competitions give climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between each attempt , unlike the IFSC format , in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose . In an open-format competition , all climbers compete simultaneously , and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible . More points are awarded for more difficult problems , while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem . In 2012 , the IFSC submitted a proposal to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to include lead climbing in the 2020 Summer Olympics . The proposal was later revised to an \" overall \" competition , which would feature bouldering , lead climbing , and speed climbing . In May 2013 , the IOC announced that climbing would not be added to the 2020 Olympic program . = = History = = Rock climbing first emerged as a sport in the mid-1800s . Early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering , not as a separate discipline , but as a form of training for larger ascents . In the early 20th century , the Fontainebleau area of France established itself as a prominent climbing area , where some of the first dedicated bleausards ( or \" boulderers \" ) emerged . The specialized rock climbing shoe was invented by one such athlete , Pierre Allain . In the 1960s , the sport was pushed forward by American mathematician John Gill , who contributed several important innovations . Gill 's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics , a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions . He applied this idea to bouldering , which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds . Gill developed a closed-ended rating system : B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time , B2 problems were more difficult , and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once . Gill introduced chalk as a method of keeping the climber 's hands dry . He also emphasized the importance of strength training to complement technical skill . Neither of these practices had been popular among climbers , but as Gill 's ability level and influence grew , his ideas became the norm . Two important training tools emerged in the 1980s : Bouldering mats and artificial climbing walls . The former , also referred to as \" crash pads \" , prevented injuries from falling , and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous to attempt otherwise . Indoor climbing walls helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing , and allowed serious climbers to train year-round regardless of weather conditions . As the sport grew in popularity , new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States , and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions . The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s , as YouTube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques , find hard problems , and announce newly completed projects . In early 2010 , two American climbers claimed first ascents on boulder problems that have come to be regarded as the most difficult in the world : The Game near Boulder , Colorado , established by Daniel Woods ; and Lucid Dreaming near Bishop , California , established by Paul Robinson . The following year , fellow American Carlo Traversi claimed the second ascent of The Game and in January 2014 , American Daniel Woods completed the second ascent of \" Lucid Dreaming . \" In 2011 , Czech climber Adam Ondra claimed the second ascent of Gioia , originally established three years earlier by Italian boulderer Christian Core , and suggested that it was among the world 's most challenging boulder problems . = = Equipment = = Unlike other climbing sports , bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment , an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers . Bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that \" The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders \" . Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag as the bare minimum , while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of shoes , chalk , brushes , crash pads , and a skincare kit . Of the aforementioned equipment , climbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance . Besides protecting the climber 's feet from rough surfaces , climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure and maintain footholds . Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear , and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork . They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations : High-top shoes , for example , provide better protection for the ankle , while low-top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement . Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges , whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity . The front of the shoe , called the \" toe box \" , can be asymmetric , which performs well on overhanging rocks , or symmetric , which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs . Most boulderers use gymnastics chalk on their hands to absorb sweat . It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist , allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb . Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs ; they are often attached to the end of a stick , pipe , or other straight object in order to reach higher holds . Crash pads , also referred to as bouldering mats , are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls . = = Safety = = Boulder problems are generally shorter than 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) from ground to top . This makes the sport significantly safer than free solo climbing , which is also performed without ropes , but with no upper limit on the height of the climb . However , minor injuries are common in bouldering , particularly sprained ankles and wrists . Two factors contribute to the frequency of injuries in bouldering : first , boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines , making falls more common . Second , without ropes to arrest the climber 's descent , every fall will cause the climber to hit the ground . To prevent injuries , boulderers position crash pads near the boulder to provide a softer landing , as well as one or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads . Upon landing , boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics : spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures , and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact . = = Technique = = As with other forms of climbing , bouldering technique is largely centered on proper footwork . Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles ; thus , proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning , relying on their legs to push them up the boulder . Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible , allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles . Bouldering movements are described as either \" static \" or \" dynamic \" . Static movements are those that are performed slowly , with the climber 's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs . Dynamic movements use the climber 's momentum to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically , with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately . = = Grading = = Bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by routesetters and climbers . The two most widely used rating systems are the V-scale and the Fontainebleau system . The V-scale , which originated in the United States , is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty . The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts . The scale begins at V0 , and as of 2013 , the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V16 . Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems . The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system , with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters a , b , and c . For example , Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6 , while Fontainebleau 7C + is equivalent to V10 . In both systems , grades are further differentiated by appending \" + \" to indicate a small increase in difficulty . Despite this level of specificity , ratings of individual problems are often controversial , as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber . Height , arm length , flexibility , and other body characteristics can also be relevant . = = Environmental impact = = Bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks , such as mosses and lichens . This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder , or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds . Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse , particularly by climbers laying down crash pads . Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails , or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer . Other environmental concerns include littering , improperly disposed feces , and graffiti . These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering , as was the case in Tea Garden , a popular bouldering area in Rocklands , South Africa .",

While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems ( the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb ) are usually less than 6 meters ( 20 ft. ) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders."

        "doc": "George Rogers Clark = George Rogers Clark ( November 19 , 1752 \u2013 February 13 , 1818 ) was a surveyor , soldier , and militia officer from Virginia and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the American Revolutionary War . He served as leader of the Kentucky ( then part of Virginia ) militia throughout much of the war . Clark is best known for his celebrated captures of Kaskaskia ( 1778 ) and Vincennes ( 1779 ) during the Illinois Campaign , which greatly weakened British influence in the Northwest Territory . Because the British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , Clark has often been hailed as the \" Conqueror of the Old Northwest \" . Clark 's military achievements all came before his 30th birthday . Afterwards he led militia in the opening engagements of the Northwest Indian War , but was accused of being drunk on duty . Despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations , he was disgraced and forced to resign . He left Kentucky to live on the Indiana frontier . Never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures , Clark spent the final decades of his life evading creditors , and living in increasing poverty and obscurity . He was involved in two failed conspiracies to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic . After suffering a stroke and the loss of his leg , Clark was aided in his final years by family members , including his younger brother William , one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Clark died of a stroke on February 13 , 1818 . = = Early years = = George Rogers Clark was born on November 19 , 1752 in Charlottesville , Virginia , near the home of Thomas Jefferson . He was the second of ten children of John Clark and Ann Rogers Clark , who were Anglicans of English and Scots ancestry . Five of their six sons became officers during the American Revolutionary War . Their youngest son , William Clark , was too young to fight in the Revolution , but later became famous as a leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . In about 1756 , after the outbreak of the French and Indian War ( part of the worldwide Seven Years ' War ) , the family moved away from the frontier to Caroline County , Virginia , and lived on a 400-acre ( 1.6 km2 ) plantation that later grew to over 2,000 acres ( 8.1 km2 ) . Little is known of Clark 's schooling . He lived with his grandfather so he could attend Donald Robertson 's school with James Madison and John Taylor of Caroline and received a common education . He was also tutored at home , as was usual for Virginian planters ' children of the period . Becoming a planter , he was taught to survey land by his grandfather . At age nineteen , Clark left his home on his first surveying trip into western Virginia . In 1772 , as a twenty-year-old surveyor , Clark made his first trip into Kentucky via the Ohio River at Pittsburgh . Thousands of settlers were entering the area as a result of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768 . In 1774 , Clark was preparing to lead an expedition of ninety men down the Ohio River when war broke out with the American Indians . Although most of Kentucky was not inhabited by Indians , several tribes used the area for hunting . The tribes living in the Ohio country had not been party to the treaty signed with the Cherokee , which ceded the Kentucky hunting grounds to Britain for settlement . They attacked the European-American settlers to try to push them out of the area , conflicts that eventually culminated in Lord Dunmore 's War . Clark served in the war as a captain in the Virginia militia . = = Revolutionary War = = As the American Revolutionary War began in the East , settlers in Kentucky were involved in a dispute over the region 's sovereignty . Richard Henderson , a judge and land speculator from North Carolina , had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty . Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania , but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania 's authority over them . In June 1776 , these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly , asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky . Clark and Jones traveled via the Wilderness Road to Williamsburg , where they convinced Governor Patrick Henry to create Kentucky County , Virginia . Clark was given 500 lb ( 230 kg ) of gunpowder to help defend the settlements and was appointed a major in the Kentucky County militia . Clark was just 24 years old , but older settlers such as Daniel Boone , Benjamin Logan , and Leonard Helm looked to him as a leader . = = = Illinois campaign = = = In 1777 , the American Revolutionary War intensified in Kentucky . Armed and encouraged by British lieutenant governor Henry Hamilton at Fort Detroit , Native Americans waged war and raided the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground . The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion of the Northwest or the defense of distant Kentucky , so its defense was left entirely to the local population . Clark participated in several skirmishes against the Native American raiders . As a leader of the defense of Kentucky , Clark believed that the best way to end these raids was to seize British outposts north of the Ohio River , thereby destroying British influence with the Indians . Clark asked Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia for permission to lead a secret expedition to capture the nearest British posts , which were located in the Illinois country . Governor Henry commissioned Clark as a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia and authorized him to raise troops for the expedition . In July 1778 , Clark and about 175 men crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia , taking it on the night of July 4 . Cahokia , Vincennes , and several other villages and forts in British territory were subsequently captured without firing a shot , because most of the French-speaking and American Indian inhabitants were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British . To counter Clark 's advance , Henry Hamilton reoccupied Vincennes with a small force . In February 1779 , Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town , capturing Hamilton in the process . The winter expedition was Clark 's most significant military achievement and became the source of his reputation as an early American military hero . When news of his victory reached General George Washington , Clark 's success was celebrated and was used to encourage the alliance with France . Washington recognized his achievement had been gained without support from the regular army in men or funds . Virginia capitalized on Clark 's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest , calling it Illinois County . = = = Final years of the war = = = Clark 's ultimate goal during the Revolutionary War was to seize British-held Detroit , but he could never recruit enough men to make the attempt . The Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes by staying closer to Kentucky rather than making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit . In June 1780 , a mixed force of British and Indians , including Shawnee , Delaware , Wyandot and others , from Detroit invaded Kentucky with cannons , capturing two fortified settlements and carrying away hundreds of prisoners . In August 1780 , Clark led a retaliatory force that won a victory at the Shawnee village of Peckuwe , at what is now called George Rogers Clark Park near Springfield , Ohio . The next year Clark was promoted to brigadier general by Governor Thomas Jefferson , and was given command of all the militia in the Kentucky and Illinois counties . He prepared again to lead an expedition against Detroit . Although Washington transferred a small group of regulars to assist Clark , the detachment was disastrously defeated in August 1781 before they could meet up with Clark , ending the campaign . In August 1782 , another British-Indian force defeated the Kentucky militia at the Battle of Blue Licks . Although Clark had not been present at the battle , as senior military officer , he was severely criticized in the Virginia Council for the disaster . In response , Clark led another expedition into the Ohio country , destroying several Indian towns along the Great Miami River in the last major expedition of the war . The importance of Clark 's activities in the Revolutionary War has been the subject of much debate among historians . As early as 1779 he was called the Conqueror of the Northwest by George Mason . Because the British ceded the entire Old Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , some historians , including William Hayden English , credit Clark with nearly doubling the size of the original Thirteen Colonies by seizing control of the Illinois country during the war . Clark 's Illinois campaign \u2014 particularly the surprise march to Vincennes \u2014 was greatly celebrated and romanticized . Other historians , such as Lowell Harrison , have downplayed the importance of the campaign in the peace negotiations and the outcome of the war , arguing that Clark 's \" conquest \" was little more than a temporary occupation . = = Later years = = Clark was just thirty years old when the Revolutionary War ended , but his greatest military achievements were already behind him . Ever since Clark 's victories in Illinois , settlers had been pouring into Kentucky , often illegally squatting on Indian land north of the Ohio River . From 1784 until 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia 's war veterans and surveyed the lands granted to them for their service in the war . The position brought a small income , but Clark devoted very little time to the enterprise . Clark helped to negotiate the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 and the Treaty of Fort Finney in 1786 with tribes north of the river , but violence between Native Americans and Kentucky settlers continued to escalate . According to a 1790 U.S. government report , 1,500 Kentucky settlers had been killed in Indian raids since the end of the Revolutionary War . In an attempt to end these raids , Clark led an expedition of 1,200 drafted men against Indian towns on the Wabash River in 1786 , one of the first actions of the Northwest Indian War . The campaign ended without a victory : lacking supplies , about three hundred militiamen mutinied , and Clark had to withdraw , but not before concluding a ceasefire with the Indians . It was rumored , most notably by James Wilkinson , that Clark had often been drunk on duty . When Clark learned of the rumors he demanded an official inquiry be made , but his request was declined by Governor of Virginia , and Virginia Council condemned Clark 's actions . Clark 's reputation was tarnished , he never again led men in battle , and he left Kentucky , moving into the Indiana frontier near Clarksville = = = Life in Indiana = = = Clark lived most of the rest of his life in financial difficulties . Clark had financed the majority of his military campaigns with borrowed funds . When creditors began to come to him for these unpaid debts , he was unable to obtain recompense from Virginia or the United States Congress because record keeping on the frontier during the war had been haphazard . For his services in the war Virginia gave Clark a gift of 150,000 acres ( 610 km2 ) of land . The soldiers who fought with Clark also received smaller tracts of land . Together with Clark 's Grant and his other holdings , his ownership encompassed all of present-day Clark County , Indiana and most of the surrounding counties . Although Clark had claims to tens of thousands of acres of land resulting from his military service and land speculation , he was \" land-poor \" , meaning that he owned much land but lacked the means to make money from it . With his career seemingly over and his prospects for prosperity doubtful , on February 2 , 1793 , Clark offered his services to Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat , the controversial ambassador of revolutionary France , hoping to earn money to maintain his estate . Western Americans were outraged that the Spanish , who controlled Louisiana , denied Americans free access to the Mississippi River , their only easy outlet for long distance commerce . The Washington Administration was also seemingly deaf to western concerns about opening the Mississippi to U.S. commerce . Clark proposed to Gen\u00eat that , with French financial support , he could lead an expedition to drive the Spanish out of the Mississippi Valley . Gen\u00eat appointed Clark \" Major General in the Armies of France and Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the Mississippi River \" . Clark began to organize a campaign to seize New Madrid , St. Louis , Natchez , and New Orleans , getting assistance from old comrades such as Benjamin Logan and John Montgomery , and winning the tacit support of Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby . Clark spent $ 4,680 ( $ 59,161 in 2009 chained dollars ) of his own money for supplies . In early 1794 , however , President Washington issued a proclamation forbidding Americans from violating U.S. neutrality and threatened to dispatch General Anthony Wayne to Fort Massac to stop the expedition . The French government recalled Gen\u00eat and revoked the commissions he granted to the Americans for the war against Spain . Clark 's planned campaign gradually collapsed , and he was unable to convince the French to reimburse him for his expenses . Due to his growing debt , it became impossible for Clark to continue holding his land , since it became subject to seizure . Much of his land he deeded to friends or transferred to family members where it could be held for him , so that it would not be lost to his creditors . After a few years , the lenders and their assignees closed in and deprived the veteran of almost all of the property that remained in his name . Clark , once the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory , was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville , where he built a small gristmill which he worked with two African American slaves . Clark lived on for another two decades , and continued to struggle with alcohol abuse , a problem which had plagued him on-and-off for many years . He was very bitter about his treatment and neglect by Virginia , and blamed his misfortune on the state . The Indiana Territory chartered the Indiana Canal Company in 1805 to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio , near Clarksville . Clark was named to the board of directors and was part of the surveying team that assisted in laying out the route of the canal . The company collapsed the next year before construction could begin , when two of the fellow board members , including Vice President Aaron Burr , were arrested for treason . A large part of the company 's $ 1.2 million ( $ 60.5 million in 2009 chained dollars ) in investments was unaccounted for , and where the funds went was never determined . = = = Return to Kentucky = = = In 1809 Clark suffered a severe stroke . Falling into an operating fireplace , he suffered a burn on one leg so severe as to necessitate the amputation of the limb . It was impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill , so he became a dependent member of the household of his brother-in-law , Major William Croghan , a planter at Locust Grove farm eight miles ( 13 km ) from the growing town of Louisville . During 1812 , the Virginia General Assembly granted Clark a pension of four hundred dollars per year , and finally recognized his services in the Revolution by granting him a ceremonial sword . After a second stroke , Clark died at Locust Grove , February 13 , 1818 , and was buried at Locust Grove Cemetery two days later . In his funeral oration , Judge John Rowan succinctly summed up the stature and importance of George Rogers Clark during the critical years on the Trans-Appalachian frontier : \" The mighty oak of the forest has fallen , and now the scrub oaks sprout all around . \" Clark 's body was exhumed along with the rest of his family members on October 29 , 1869 , and reburied at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville . Several years after Clark 's death the state of Virginia granted his estate $ 30,000 ( $ 568,853 in 2009 chained dollars ) as a partial payment on the debts that they owed him . The government of Virginia continued to find debt to Clark for decades , with the last payment to his estate being made in 1913 . Clark never married and he kept no account of any romantic relationships , although his family held that he had once been in love with Teresa de Leyba , sister of Don Fernando de Leyba , the Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Louisiana . Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts attest to their belief in Clark 's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance . = = Legacy = = On May 23 , 1928 , President Calvin Coolidge ordered a memorial to George Rogers Clark to be erected in Vincennes . Completed in 1933 , the George Rogers Clark Memorial , built in Roman Classical style , stands on what was then believed to be the site of Fort Sackville , and is now the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park . It includes a statue of Clark by Hermon Atkins MacNeil . On February 25 , 1929 , to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the surrender of Fort Sackville , the U.S. Post Office Department issued a 2-cent postage stamp that depicted the surrender . In April 1929 , the Paul Revere Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Muncie , Indiana erected a monument to George Rogers Clark on Washington Avenue in Fredericksburg , Virginia . The marker doesn 't identify the connection between General Clark and Fredericksburg , so this choice of location is currently a mystery . In 1975 , the Indiana General Assembly designated February 25 George Rogers Clark Day in Indiana . Built in 1929 , the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge ( Second Street Bridge ) carries U.S. Highway 31 , over the Ohio River at Louisville , Kentucky . Other statues of Clark can be found in : Metropolis , Fort Massac , Illinois , by sculptor Leon Hermant , placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution in the early 1900s . Louisville , Kentucky , by sculptor Felix de Weldon , at Riverfront Plaza \/ Belvedere , next to the wharf on the Ohio River . Springfield , Ohio , by Charles Keck at the site of the Battle of Piqua . Charlottesville , Virginia , by Robert Aitken on the grounds of the University of Virginia . Quincy , Illinois , in Riverview Park , on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River . Indianapolis , Indiana , by sculptor John H. Mahoney , on Monument Circle . Places named for Clark include counties in Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky ( home to George Rogers Clark High School ) , Ohio ( home to Clark State Community College ) , and Virginia , and communities in West Virginia ( Clarksburg ) , Indiana ( Clarksville ) , and Tennessee ( also Clarksville ) . Clark Street in Chicago , Illinois is named for him , as is a campsite in the Woodland Trails Scout Reservation , Camden , Ohio . Schools named after Clark include : George Rogers Clark College in Indianapolis , Indiana ( closed 1992 ) George Rogers Clark Elementary School in Clarksville , Indiana ( closed 2010 ) George Rogers Clark Middle \/ High School in Hammond , Indiana George Rogers Clark High School in Winchester , Kentucky Clark Middle School in Winchester , Kentucky Clark Elementary School in Charlottesville , Virginia George Rogers Clark Middle School in Vincennes , Indiana George Rogers Clark Elementary School of Chicago .
