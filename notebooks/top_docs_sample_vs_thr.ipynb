The Su-9 was slower than competing Soviet aircraft and it was cancelled as a result . A modified version with different engines and a revised wing became the Su-11 ( Samolyet KL ) , but this did not enter production either .

Produced in limited numbers , it was used to bomb Berlin in August 1941 . It was also used for so-called \" morale raids \" designed to raise the spirit of the Soviet people by exposing Axis vulnerabilities . Its primary mission , however , was to attack German airfields , rail yards and other rear-area facilities at night , although one was used to fly the People 's Commissar of Foreign Affairs ( Foreign Minister ) Vyacheslav Molotov from Moscow to the United States in 1942 . Originally designated the TB-7 , the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer , Vladimir Petlyakov , died in a plane crash in 1942 . Supply problems complicated the aircraft 's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems . As Soviet morale boosters , they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe 's fighter pilots .

It runs from a junction at Chalfont & Latimer with the Metropolitan line and the Chiltern Railways route to Aylesbury , and runs for 3.89 miles ( 6.26 km ) northwest to its only other station at Chesham . Its terminus at Chesham has since 1961 been the westernmost and since 1994 the northernmost point on the London Underground network . The line was built as part of Edward Watkin 's scheme to turn his Metropolitan Railway ( MR ) into a direct rail route between London and Manchester , and it was envisaged that a station outside Chesham would be an intermediate stop on a through route running north to connect with the London and North Western Railway ( LNWR ) .

It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions . A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured . Furthermore , Hilbert spaces are complete : there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used . Hilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in mathematics and physics , typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces . The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied from this point of view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert , Erhard Schmidt , and Frigyes Riesz .

       "      <td>Derivative = The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of a quantity ( a function value or dependent variable ) which is determined by another quantity ( the independent variable ) . Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus . For example , the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object 's velocity : this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time is advanced . The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value , when it exists , is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point . The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value . For this reason , the derivative is often described as the \" instantaneous rate of change \" , the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable . Derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables .</td>\n",

The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements , called axioms , listed below . Euclidean vectors are an example of a vector space . They represent physical quantities such as forces : any two forces ( of the same type ) can be added to yield a third , and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector .

The delta function is sometimes thought of as a hypothetical function whose graph is an infinitely high , infinitely thin spike at the origin , with total area one under the spike , and physically represents the density of an idealized point mass or point charge . It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac . From a purely mathematical viewpoint , the Dirac delta is not strictly a function , because any extended-real function that is equal to zero everywhere but a single point must have total integral zero .

Provided that they are the same size ( have the same number of rows and the same number of columns ) , two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element . The rule for matrix multiplication , however , is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second . Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field . A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations , that is , generalizations of linear functions such as f ( x ) = 4x .

       "5  Derivative = The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of a quantity ( a function value or dependent variable ) which is determined by another quantity ( the independent variable ) . Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus . For example , the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object 's velocity : this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time is advanced . The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value , when it exists , is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point . The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value . For this reason , the derivative is often described as the \" instantaneous rate of change \" , the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable . Derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables .    \n",

       "5  Dirac delta function = In mathematics , the Dirac delta function , or δ function , is a generalized function , or distribution , on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero , with an integral of one over the entire real line . The delta function is sometimes thought of as a hypothetical function whose graph is an infinitely high , infinitely thin spike at the origin , with total area one under the spike , and physically represents the density of an idealized point mass or point charge . It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac . From a purely mathematical viewpoint , the Dirac delta is not strictly a function , because any extended-real function that is equal to zero everywhere but a single point must have total integral zero . The delta function only makes sense as a mathematical object when it appears inside an integral . From this perspective the Dirac delta can usually be manipulated as though it were a function .

Provided that they are the same size ( have the same number of rows and the same number of columns ) , two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element . The rule for matrix multiplication , however , is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second . Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field . A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations , that is , generalizations of linear functions such as f ( x ) = 4x .

Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose , who investigated these sets in the 1970s . The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original . A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry , as in the diagram at the right . A Penrose tiling has many remarkable properties , most notably : It is non-periodic , which means that it lacks any translational symmetry . It is self-similar , so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales . Thus , the tiling can be obtained through \" inflation \" ( or \" deflation \" ) and any finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times . It is a quasicrystal : implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce Bragg diffraction and its diffractogram reveals both the fivef   \n",

       "3  Dictator novel = The dictator novel ( Spanish : novela del dictador ) is a genre of Latin American literature that challenges the role of the dictator in Latin American society . The theme of caudillismo — the régime of a charismatic caudillo , a political strongman — is addressed by examining the relationships between power , dictatorship , and writing . Moreover , a dictator novel often is an allegory for the role of the writer in a Latin American society . Although mostly associated with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s , the dictator-novel genre has its roots in the nineteenth-century novel Facundo ( 1845 ) , by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento . As an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas 's dictatorial régime in Argentina , Facundo is the forerunner of the dictator novel genre ; all subsequent dictator novels hearken back to it . As established by Sarmiento , the goal of the genre is not to analyze the rule of particular dictators , or to focus on historical accuracy    \n",

The advantage of doing this is that there is a large body of theory and analysis techniques concerning complex electrical systems , especially in the field of filters . By converting to an electrical representation , these tools in the electrical domain can be directly applied to a mechanical system without modification . A further advantage occurs in electromechanical systems : Converting the mechanical part of such a system into the electrical domain allows the entire system to be analysed as a unified whole . The mathematical behaviour of the simulated electrical system is identical to the mathematical behaviour of the represented mechanical system . Each element in the electrical domain has a corresponding element in the mechanical domain with an analogous constitutive equation . All laws of circuit analy   \n",

       "5  Hilbert space = The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space , named after David Hilbert , generalizes the notion of Euclidean space . It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions . A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured . Furthermore , Hilbert spaces are complete : there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used . Hilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in mathematics and physics , typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces . The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied from this point of view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert , Erhard Schmidt , and Frigyes Riesz . They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations , quantum mechanics , Fourier analysis ( which inc  \n",

Their design began as an improved version of the Queen Elizabeth-class battleships , but it was recast as a battlecruiser after Admiral John Jellicoe , commander of the Grand Fleet , pointed out that there was no real need for more battleships , but that a number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to the bulk of the Grand Fleet 's battlecruisers and the design was revised to counter these . The class was to have consisted of HMS Hood , Anson , Howe , and Rodney — all names of famous admirals — but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels . Their designs were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland , but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to beg   \n",
