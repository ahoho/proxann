                    "text": "Battle of White Plains = The Battle of White Plains was a battle in the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War fought on October 28 , 1776 , near White Plains , New York . Following the retreat of George Washington 's Continental Army northward from New York City , British General William Howe landed troops in Westchester County , intending to cut off Washington 's escape route . Alerted to this move , Washington retreated farther , establishing a position in the village of White Plains but failed to establish firm control over local high ground . Howe 's troops drove Washington 's troops from a hill near the village ; following this loss , Washington ordered the Americans to retreat farther north . Later British movements chased Washington across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania . Washington then crossed the Delaware and surprised a brigade of Hessian troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton . = = Background = = British General William Howe , after evacuating Boston in March 1776 , regrouped in Halifax , Nova Scotia , and embarked in June on a campaign to gain control of New York City . The campaign began with an unopposed landing on Staten Island in early July . British troops made another unopposed landing on Long Island on August 22 , south of the areas where General George Washington 's Continental Army had organized significant defenses around Brooklyn Heights . After losing the Battle of Long Island on August 27 , General Washington and his army of 9,000 troops escaped on the night of August 29 \u2013 30 to York Island ( as Manhattan was then called ) . General Howe followed up with a landing on Manhattan on September 15 , but his advance was checked the next day at Harlem Heights . After an abortive landing at Throg 's Neck , he landed troops with some resistance at Pell 's Point on October 18 to begin an encircling maneuver that was intended to trap Washington 's army between that force , his troops in Manhattan , and the Hudson River , which was dominated by warships of the Royal Navy . Howe established a camp at New Rochelle , but advance elements of his army were near Mamaroneck , only 7 miles ( 11 km ) from White Plains , where there was a lightly defended Continental Army supply depot . = = Prelude = = On October 20 , General Washington sent Colonel Rufus Putnam out on a reconnaissance mission from his camp at Harlem Heights . Putnam discovered the general placement of the British troop locations and recognized the danger to the army and its supplies . When he reported this to Washington that evening , Washington immediately dispatched Putnam with orders to Lord Stirling , whose troops were furthest north , to immediately march to White Plains . They arrived at White Plains at 9 am on October 21 , and were followed by other units of the army as the day progressed . Washington decided to withdraw most of the army to White Plains , leaving a garrison of 1,200 men under Nathanael Greene to defend Fort Washington on Manhattan . General Howe 's army advanced slowly , with troops from his center and right moving along the road from New Rochelle to White Plains , while a unit of Loyalists occupied Mamaroneck . The latter was attacked that night by a detachment of Lord Stirling 's troops under John Haslet , who took more than thirty prisoners as well as supplies , but suffered several killed and 15 wounded . As a result , Howe moved elements of his right wing to occupy Mamaroneck . On October 22 , Howe was reinforced by the landing at New Rochelle of an additional 8,000 troops under the command of Wilhelm von Knyphausen . Washington established his headquarters at the Elijah Miller House in North White Plains on October 23 , and chose a defensive position that he fortified with two lines of entrenchments . The trenches were situated on raised terrain , protected on the right by the swampy ground near the Bronx River , with steeper hills further back as a place of retreat . The American defenses were 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) long . Beyond that , on the right , was Chatterton 's Hill , which commanded the plain over which the British would have to advance . The hill was initially occupied by militia companies numbering several hundred , probably including John Brooks ' Massachusetts militia company . On October 24 and 25 , Howe 's army moved from New Rochelle to Scarsdale , where they established a camp covering the eastern bank of the Bronx River . This move was apparently made in the hopes of catching Charles Lee 's column , which had to alter its route toward White Plains and execute a forced march at night to avoid them . Howe remained at Scarsdale until the morning of October 28 , when his forces marched toward White Plains , with British troops on the right under General Henry Clinton , and primarily Hessian troops on the left under General von Heister . = = Battle = = While Washington was inspecting the terrain to determine where it was best to station his troops , messengers alerted him that the British were advancing . Returning to his headquarters , he ordered the 2nd Connecticut Regiment under Joseph Spencer out to slow the British advance , and sent Haslet and the 1st Delaware Regiment , along with Alexander McDougall 's brigade ( Rudolphus Ritzema 's 3rd New York Regiment , Charles Webb 's 19th Continental Regiment , William Smallwood 's 1st Maryland Regiment , and the 1st New York Regiment and 2nd New York Regiments ) to reinforce Chatterton Hill . Spencer 's force crossed the Bronx River , set up behind a stone wall , and exchanged fire with the Hessians led by Colonel Johann Rall that were at the head of the British left column . Eventually forced to retreat when Clinton 's column threatened their flank , these companies retreated across the Bronx River , while fire from the troops on Chatterton Hill covered their move . Rall 's troops attempted to gain the hill , but were repelled by fire from Haslet 's troops and the militia , and retreated to a nearby hilltop on the same side of the river . This concerted defense brought the entire British Army , which was maneuvering as if to attack the entire American line , to a stop . While Howe and his command conferred , the Hessian artillery on the left opened fire on the hilltop position , where they succeeded in driving the militia into a panicked retreat . The arrival of McDougall and his brigade helped to rally them , and a defensive line was established , with the militia on the right and the Continentals arrayed along the top of the hill . Howe finally issued orders , and while most of his army waited , a detachment of British and Hessian troops was sent to take the hill . The British attack was organized with Hessian regiments leading the assault . Rall was to charge the American right , while a Hessian battalion under Colonel Carl von Donop ( consisting of the Linsing , Mingerode , Lengereck , and Kochler grenadiers , and Donop 's own chasseur regiment ) was to attack the center . A British column under General Alexander Leslie ( consisting of the 5th , 28th , 35th , and 49th Foot ) was to attack the right . Donop 's force either had difficulty crossing the river , or was reluctant to do so , and elements of the British force were the first to cross the river . Rall 's charge scattered the militia on the American right , leaving the flank of the Maryland and New York regiments exposed as they poured musket fire onto the British attackers , which temporarily halted the British advance . The exposure of their flank caused them to begin a fighting retreat , which progressively forced the remainder of the American line , which had engaged with the other segments of the British force , to give way and retreat . Haslet 's Delaware regiment , which anchored the American left , provided covering fire while the remaining troops retreated to the north , and were the last to leave the hill . The fighting was intense , and both sides suffered significant casualties before the Continentals made a disciplined retreat . = = Casualties = = John Fortescue 's History of the British Army says that Howe 's casualties numbered 214 British and 99 Hessians . However , Rodney Atwood points out that Fortescue 's figure for the Hessians includes the entire Hessian casualties from 19 \u2013 28 October and that in fact only 53 of these casualties were incurred at the Battle of White Plains . This revised figure would give a total of 267 British and Hessians killed , wounded or missing at White Plains . Henry Dawson , on the other hand , gives Howe 's loss as 47 killed , 182 wounded and 4 missing . The American loss is uncertain . Theodore Savas and J. David Dameron give a range of 150-500 killed , wounded and captured . Samuel Roads numbers the casualties of 47 killed and 70 wounded . Henry Dawson estimates 50 killed , 150 wounded and 17 missing for McDougall 's and Spencer 's commands but has no information on the losses in Haslet 's regiment . = = Aftermath = = The two generals remained where they were for two days , while Howe reinforced the position on Chatterton Hill , and Washington organized his army for retreat into the hills . With the arrival of additional Hessian and Waldeck troops under Lord Percy on October 30 , Howe planned to act against the Americans the following day . However , a heavy rain fell the whole next day , and when Howe was finally prepared to act , he awoke to find that Washington had again eluded his grasp . Washington withdrew his army into the hills to the north on the night of October 31 , establishing a camp near North Castle . Howe chose not to follow , instead attempting without success to draw Washington out . On November 5 , he turned his army south to finish evicting Continental Army troops from Manhattan , a task he accomplished with the November 16 Battle of Fort Washington . Washington eventually crossed the Hudson River at Peekskill with most of his army , leaving New England regiments behind to guard supply stores and important river crossings . Later , British movements chased him across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania , and the British established a chain of outposts across New Jersey . Washington , seeing an opportunity for a victory to boost the nation 's morale , crossed the Delaware and surprised Rall 's troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton . = = Legacy = = Each year on or near the anniversary date , the White Plains Historical Society hosts a commemoration of the event at the Jacob Purdy House in White Plains , New York . Two ships in the United States Navy were named for the Battle of White Plains . CVE-66 was an escort carrier in World War II . AFS-4 was a combat stores ship that was decommissioned in 1995 after suffering extensive damage in 1992 's Typhoon Omar . According to some historians , the Headless Horseman depicted in Washington Irving 's short story \" The Legend of Sleepy Hollow \" was inspired by a real-life Hessian soldier who lost his head by cannon fire during this battle .",

                    "text": "Battle of Spencer 's Ordinary = The Battle of Spencer 's Ordinary was an inconclusive skirmish that took place on 26 June 1781 , late in the American Revolutionary War . British forces under Lieutenant Colonel John Graves Simcoe and American forces under Colonel Richard Butler , light detachments from the armies of General Lord Cornwallis and the Marquis de Lafayette respectively , clashed near a tavern ( the \" ordinary \" ) at a road intersection not far from Williamsburg , Virginia . Lafayette had been shadowing Cornwallis as he moved his army toward Williamsburg from central Virginia . Aware that Simcoe had become separated from Cornwallis , he sent Butler out in an attempt to cut Simcoe off . Both sides , concerned that the other might be reinforced by its main army , eventually broke off the battle . = = Background = = In May 1781 , Lord Charles Cornwallis arrived in Petersburg , Virginia after a lengthy campaign through North and South Carolina . In addition to his 1,400 troops , he assumed command of another 3,600 troops that had been under the command of the turncoat Benedict Arnold , and was soon thereafter further reinforced by about 2,000 more troops sent from New York . These forces were opposed by a much smaller Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette , then located at Richmond . Following orders originally given to Arnold 's predecessor in command , William Phillips ( who died a week before Cornwallis ' arrival ) , Cornwallis worked to eliminate Virginia 's ability to support the revolutionary cause , and gave chase to Lafayette 's army , which numbered barely 3,000 and included a large number of inexperienced militia . Lafayette successfully eluded engaging Cornwallis for about one month , who used his numerical advantage to detach forces for raids against economic , military , and political targets in central Virginia . Cornwallis then turned back to the east , marching for Williamsburg . Lafayette , whose force grew to number about 4,000 with the arrival of Continental Army reinforcements under General Anthony Wayne and additional experienced militiamen under William Campbell , followed Cornwallis . Buoyed by the increase in his troop strength , Lafayette also became more aggressive in his tactics , sending out detachments of his force to counteract those that Cornwallis sent on forage and raiding expeditions . These detachments were composed of select units taken from a variety of regiments . Among those that were commonly in the army 's advance guard were a combined cavalry and infantry unit from Pennsylvania under Captain William McPherson , and companies of Virginia riflemen under Majors Richard Call and John Willis . Lafayette , once he was joined by Wayne and Campbell , wanted to engage elements of Cornwallis ' army without necessarily facing its full strength . As Cornwallis approached Williamsburg , Lafayette and Wayne received word that Lieutenant Colonel John Graves Simcoe and his Loyalist regiment of Queen 's Rangers were returning from a raid to destroy boats and forage for supplies on the Chickahominy River . Simcoe 's full force included , in addition to the Rangers , a few companies of Hessian j\u00e4gers led by Captains Johann Ewald and Johann Althaus . On the night of 25 June , Wayne sent most of the advance guard under Colonel Richard Butler , including McPherson , Call , and Willis , to intercept Simcoe 's force . A forward party of about 50 dragoons and 50 light infantry under McPherson caught up with advance companies of Simcoe 's force near Spencer 's Ordinary , a tavern at a road intersection about 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) north of Williamsburg . = = Battle = = Simcoe 's troops were moving down the road toward Williamsburg , convoying some cattle with the infantry and j\u00e4gers in the lead under Major Richard Armstrong , with Simcoe and the cavalry about an hour behind them . At Spencer 's Ordinary ( \" ordinary \" meaning tavern at the time ) , the troops rejoined and paused to rest . Simcoe ordered fences in the area torn down since \" it was an admirable place for the chicanery of action \" . While they rested , some of the Loyalists went out to round up more cattle found in the area , and the cavalry went to a nearby farm to feed their horses . McPherson 's men encountered the latter , whose sentries raised the alarm to the main body . Simcoe 's cavalry charged McPherson 's formation , breaking it up . McPherson and a number of his men were unhorsed in the melee , and several were taken prisoner before the leading edge of Butler 's main force began to arrive . Simcoe ordered most of the infantry up to support his cavalry , and sent the j\u00e4gers and light infantry into the woods on the right to flank the arriving enemy column . By questioning the prisoners , Simcoe learned that Lafayette was not far off . He sent word to Cornwallis , dispatched the cattle convoy toward Williamsburg , and ordered trees to be felled to make a barricade across the road as a point of defense . He then arrayed his troops in a way calculated to mislead the Americans into believing that more troops were in formation just over a rise . When Butler 's force arrived , Simcoe ordered an infantry charge . This scattered the first wave of Butler 's men into the nearby woods , where the j\u00e4gers then pushed them back . However , Butler 's men continued to advance . Simcoe ordered a cavalry charge and fired a field cannon to give the impression that a larger force was arriving . The charge forced Butler 's men back , at which point the two forces disengaged , Simcoe because he was concerned that Lafayette was approaching , and Butler because his men were fooled by Simcoe 's stratagem . = = Aftermath = = Simcoe left his wounded men at the tavern under a truce flag , and withdrew down the Williamsburg road , joining with forces Cornwallis sent about two miles ( 3.2 km ) down the road . The Americans retreated to Lafayette 's camp at Tyre 's Plantation , and Simcoe was able to return to the tavern and recover his wounded . Simcoe reported his losses at 11 killed and 25 wounded , and the American loss at 9 killed , 14 wounded , and 32 captured . Lafayette claimed the Americans had killed 60 and wounded 100 , while Cornwallis claimed the British had 33 killed and wounded . ( The latter number agrees with that provided by Fryer and Dracott if Hessian casualties are excluded . ) The location of the battle is now within the grounds of James City County 's Freedom Park in Williamsburg . Published park materials do not indicate if the exact location is marked in any way . = = Butler 's identity = = Sources disagree on the name of the Butler who commanded the American force . In early histories , Benson Lossing claims that one Percival Butler was in command , who had also served under Daniel Morgan in earlier campaigns , while Henry Johnston identifies the commander as Richard Butler , a hero of Stony Point . In modern histories , Fryer and Dracott also identify him as Richard , while Brendan Morrissey apparently misidentifies him as John Butler .",

                    "text": "Battle of White Marsh = The Battle of White Marsh or Battle of Edge Hill was a battle of the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War fought December 5 \u2013 8 , 1777 , in the area surrounding Whitemarsh Township , Pennsylvania . The battle , which took the form of a series of skirmish actions , was the last major engagement of 1777 between British and American forces . George Washington , commander-in-chief of the American revolutionary forces , spent the weeks after his defeat at the Battle of Germantown encamped with the Continental Army in various locations throughout Montgomery County , just north of British-occupied Philadelphia . In early November , the Americans established an entrenched position approximately 16 miles ( 26 km ) north of Philadelphia along the Wissahickon Creek and Sandy Run , primarily situated on several hills between Old York Road and Bethlehem Pike . From here , Washington monitored British troop movements in Philadelphia and evaluated his options . On December 4 , Gen. Sir William Howe , the commander-in-chief of British forces in North America , led a sizable contingent of troops out of Philadelphia in one last attempt to destroy Washington and the Continental Army before the onset of winter . After a series of skirmishes , Howe called off the attack and returned to Philadelphia without engaging Washington in a decisive conflict . With the British back in Philadelphia , Washington was able to march his troops to winter quarters at Valley Forge . = = Background and movement to battle = = After their October 4 , 1777 , defeat at the Battle of Germantown , Washington 's army retreated along Skippack Pike to Pawling 's Mill , beyond the Perkiomen Creek , where they remained encamped until October 8 . They then marched east on Skippack Pike , turned left on Forty-Foot Road ( present-day Old Forty-Foot Road ) , and marched to Sumneytown Pike , where they camped on the property of Frederick Wampole near Kulpsville in Towamencin Township . While there , Brig. Gen. Francis Nash died of wounds incurred at Germantown and was buried in the Mennonite Meeting Cemetery . Washington remained at Towamencin for one week , gathering supplies and waiting to see if Howe would move against him . On October 16 , Washington moved his forces to Methacton Hill in Worcester Township . After learning of Howe 's withdrawal from Germantown to Philadelphia , Washington moved his army to Whitpain , 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) closer to Philadelphia , on October 20 . On October 29 , Washington 's army numbered 8,313 Continentals and 2,717 militia , although the terms of enlistment of many soldiers from Maryland and Virginia were due to expire . With his ranks reinforced , Washington dispatched a brigade to assist with the defense of Forts Mifflin and Mercer , on the Delaware River . On November 2 , at the recommendation of his council of war , Washington marched his forces to White Marsh , approximately 13 miles ( 21 km ) northwest of Philadelphia . At White Marsh , the army began to build redoubts and defensive works . After the surrender of British Lt. Gen. John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga , Washington began drawing troops from the north , including the 1,200 men of Varnum 's Rhode Island brigade , and about 1,000 more men from various Pennsylvania , Maryland and Virginia units . Maj. Gen. Horatio Gates sent Col. Daniel Morgan 's rifle corps , and the brigades of Paterson and Glover . With these additional forces , and the pending onset of winter , Washington had to face the problem of supplying his army . A quarter of the troops were barefooted , and there were very few blankets or warm clothing . Washington became so desperate that he even offered a reward of $ 10 to the person who could supply the \" best substitute for shoes , made of raw hides \" . Morale was so low and desertion so common that Washington offered a pardon on October 24 to all deserters who returned by January 1 . Washington 's loss of Philadelphia and inactivity brought criticism from Congress , who pressured him to attack the city . He therefore called a council of war on November 24 which voted against an attack 11 to 4 . Nonetheless , Washington rode out the next day to view the British defenses , which turned to be stronger than he had expected . On October 19 , Howe withdrew the British forces from Germantown and focused on the defense of Philadelphia . British military engineer Capt. John Montresor supervised the building of a series of fourteen formidable redoubts that began at Upper Ferry , along the Schuylkill River , and extended eastward to the shores of the Delaware River , just north of Philadelphia . Howe took advantage of his time in Philadelphia to raise additional forces from the loyalist population in the region . Newly-promoted Maj. John Graves Simcoe reinforced his unit , the Queen 's Rangers , which had lost over a quarter of its men at the Battle of Brandywine . William Allen , Jr . , the son of notable loyalist William Allen , raised the 1st Battalion of Pennsylvania Loyalists , and was made its lieutenant colonel . Loyalist James Chalmers raised the 1st Battalion of Maryland Loyalists , and was given its command . Recruitment also took place among the city 's Irish Catholic population , with the formation of the Irish Catholic Volunteers , and in the counties immediately surrounding Philadelphia . In mid-November , the fall of Forts Mifflin and Mercer effectively ended American control of the Delaware River , and much-needed supplies began arriving at the city 's docks , along with 2,000 additional British soldiers . The weeks with two major armies sitting within miles of each other were not without conflict , and a petite guerre ensued in the no man 's land between White Marsh and Northern Liberties . Minor skirmishes between light troops increased in intensity throughout November , with almost daily losses being incurred by both the British and the Americans . In retaliation , on November 22 , Howe ordered his troops to set fire to several large country houses in the Germantown area , including Fair Hill , a mansion and country estate that had previously belonged to John Dickinson . Eleven houses in all were burned to the ground , and residents of Philadelphia climbed onto rooftops and church steeples to watch the spectacle . Just one day earlier , crowds had gathered to watch the burning of Commodore John Hazelwood 's Pennsylvania Navy in the Delaware . On the same morning the mansions were burned , an earthquake struck Philadelphia , and was felt as far away as Lancaster . On November 27 , an aurora borealis lit up the night skies . The two events caused quite a stir among both the residents of Philadelphia and the troops , British and American alike , who took them as an ominous sign of things to come . By early December , Howe decided , despite having written to Colonial Secretary Lord George Germain requesting to be relieved of his command , that he was in a position to make one last attempt to destroy Washington 's army before the onset of winter , and he began preparations for an attack on the American forces . Washington 's intelligence network in Philadelphia , led by Maj. John Clark , became aware of British plans to surprise the Americans . According to a historically unsubstantiated story , Howe 's movements were revealed to the Americans by a Quaker woman named Lydia Darrah , who overheard British officers quartered in her house discussing Howe 's plan , and crossed the British lines to deliver this information to Col. Elias Boudinot of the Continental Army , who was at the Rising Sun Tavern between Germantown and Northern Liberties , ( located at the present day intersection of Germantown Avenue and Old York Road ) attempting to secure provisions . Boudinot immediately relayed this information to Washington , and the Continental Army was ready when Howe , with a force of approximately 10,000 men , marched out of Philadelphia just prior to midnight on December 4 . The advance column , led by Lt. Gen. Lord Cornwallis , headed up Germantown Pike . A second column , led by Lt. Gen. von Knyphausen , marched toward the American left . = = First day of battle = = Just after midnight on December 5 , Cornwallis ' vanguard , which consisted of two British light infantry battalions , skirmished with an American cavalry patrol under the command of Capt. Allen McLane near Three Mile Run on Skippack Road . McLane sent a messenger to Washington , alerting him of the British movements . While the main body of the British troops marched through Germantown , Beggarstown , and Flourtown , American alarm cannons were sounded and positions manned . At 3 : 00 am , the British halted on Chestnut Hill , just south of the American defenses , and waited for daybreak . During the night , Washington ordered his troops to build additional campfires to deceive the British . \" ... [ I ] t looked as if fifty thousand men were encamped there . By day we could see this was merely a trick ... , \" wrote Hessian Maj. Carl von Bauermeister . Expecting a confrontation , Washington took the precaution of striking his tents before sunrise , and sent the heavy baggage north to Trappe . He then dispatched troops to find out the size and intent of the British column . Brig. Gen. James Irvine of the Pennsylvania militia took 600 men and marched them through the Wissahickon Valley toward Chestnut Hill . Brig. Gen. James Potter 's brigade of about 1,000 Pennsylvania militia and Webb 's 2nd Connecticut Regiment of 200 men moved to screen Irvine 's right . Around noon , Irvine 's detachment encountered the British light infantry on the north side of Chestnut Hill . The Pennsylvania militia got off the first volley , but were soon routed by the British . While attempting to rally his fleeing troops , Irvine had three fingers shot off , and was taken prisoner when he fell from his horse . Potter 's brigade immediately fled , despite orders to advance and skirmish with the British light infantry . The 2nd Connecticut made a brief stand , killing three and wounding eleven , including British Capt. Sir James Murray-Pulteney . British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby decided to push his advantage after scattering Irvine 's troops . He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church , located on a hillock . Howe arrived a short while later , and ascended to the top of the church 's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions . Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force , he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire ; however , his guns did not have the range to hit Washington 's defenses . His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night , and planned a new way of attack for the following day . = = Second and third days of battle = = The two armies spent December 6 watching each other across the Wissahickon Valley . Howe hoped that Washington would leave his positions to attack the British ; Washington did not , preferring instead to let the British do the maneuvering . By day 's end , Howe decided upon a flanking movement toward the Americans ' left , toward Jenkintown and Cheltenham Township , while Maj. Gen. Charles Grey 's forces would create a distraction by attacking the American center . Sometime after 1 : 00 am on December 7 , Howe marched the British Army back through Germantown , and then to Jenkintown , where they remained until noon . As the British movements were concealed by a ridge on Chestnut Hill , Washington did not become aware of Howe 's maneuvering until 8 : 00 am . He immediately moved Morgan 's Rifle Corps. and Col. Mordecai Gist 's Maryland militia eastward to cover his left flank . About a mile to the right of this detachment , Brig. Gen. James Potter 's brigade of Pennsylvania militia , and Webb 's 2nd Connecticut Regiment , under Lieut . Col. Isaac Sherman , proceeded down Lime Kiln road toward Edge Hill . Movement of the British rear guard , including the J\u00e4gers and the Queen 's Rangers , was hindered by the burning of the villages of Cresheim and Beggarstown by troops at the front of the column . Howe 's right was now situated near the Abington Presbyterian Meeting . His main force moved to situate itself on Edge Hill , a ridge that ran parallel to , and a mile in front of , the American lines . Grey 's column had broken off from the main column , and proceeded up Whitemarsh Church Road toward the American center . Gen. Grey had been instructed not to attack until he heard the sound of firing from Howe 's column , but after several hours , he became impatient and decided to proceed on his own . He formed his column into three divisions , with the Queen 's Rangers were on the left , the J\u00e4gers on each side of the road , and the light infantry of the Guards on the right , and headed in the direction of Tyson 's Tavern on Limekiln Road . As Grey advanced toward the American center , his troops took fire from American militia on Edge Hill . The militia were quickly routed , with between twenty and thirty killed , and fifteen of them taken as prisoners . Gens . John Cadwalader and Joseph Reed , out reconnoitering on horse near Twickenham , the country estate of Thomas Wharton Jr . , attempted to rally the Potter 's fleeing Pennsylvania militia . Lieut . Col. Sherman , the officer in charge of the 2nd Connecticut Continentals , resented Reed 's assumption of command , and later complained to Washington that it put \" ... Officers and Men into such confusion that it rendered it impossible to keep that regularity so necessary when going into Action . \" The British soon had them surrounded and outnumbered , and the Pennsylvania militia again panicked and fled . The 2nd Connecticut Continentals made a stand , firing between two and five rounds per man ; Sherman only gave the order to retreat when the J\u00e4gers were within 15 \u2013 20 yards of his position . At some point , Cadwalader and Reed became separated from the militia , and Reed 's horse was shot out from under him . A body of Hessians charged at the two officers with bayonets , but Capt. McLane rode up with a few dragoons and ordered a charge that scattered the Hessians . McLane then took the two officers to safety . The Pennsylvania militia fled in panic down Edge Hill , across Sandy Run , and toward the main American camp . Right behind them were men of the 2nd Connecticut , also in disorderly retreat . They were pursued to within yards of their encampment by the Queen 's Rangers and J\u00e4gers , who then fell back and took a position on Edge Hill , between Grey 's troops and Howe 's main column . Morgan 's Rifle Corps. and Gist 's Maryland militia had taken position on Edge Hill , about a mile to the east of Grey 's troops , and higher up on the ridge . A small group of Americans moved down to attack Col. Twistleton 's Light Infantry of the Guards , but were quickly repulsed by the British . William Augustus West , Lord Cantelupe , who was stationed with the light infantry , noted that the 4th and 23rd Regiments engaged the Americans with 9 men killed and 19 wounded . British Maj. John Andr\u00e9 reported that one American was killed . Meanwhile , the main body of Morgan 's and Gist 's troops engaged Howe 's main column in dense woods , where they fought \" Indian style \" , from tree to tree . The Maryland militia attacked Abercromby 's 1st Light Infantry Battalion with unusual vigor : British officers , who were used to encountering militia who would flee at the first sign of battle , would later express admiration at the skill of Morgan 's and Gist 's men . Morgan 's troops were not reinforced , and were forced to retreat back to the main camp after Cornwallis sent in the 33rd Regiment of Foot . = = British withdrawal = = On the morning of December 8 , British generals and engineers once again studied the American positions , looking for any advantage they could exploit in the American defenses . To the astonishment of both the British and the Americans , Howe decided to withdraw and return to Philadelphia . Despite being successful in two major skirmishes over the previous days , his maneuvering had not gotten as far around the American flank as he had hoped and his troops ' provisions were running low . Also , the nights were getting colder and the troops had left their tentage and gear in Philadelphia . Mark Boatner says that Howe \" decided that Washington 's defenses were too strong to warrant the risk of a general assault . At 2 : 00 pm , the British began their withdrawal , lighting numerous campfires \u2014 in a tactic similar to one used by Washington three days prior \u2014 to conceal their movements . An American reconnaissance party , led by Capt. McLane , discovered that Howe was marching back down Old York Road into Philadelphia and communicated this information back to Washington . Morgan 's troops harassed the enemy 's rear , in particular Grey 's column , which was hindered by the weight of the artillery that it was transporting . A contingent of Hessians formed to oppose them with their fieldpieces and Morgan 's troops retreated . The British arrived in Philadelphia later that day . = = Casualties = = No American official casualty return from December 5 to 8 is known to exist . Some information , however , can be pieced together from various sources . For December 5 , David Martin says that General Irvine 's force took about 40 casualties , while a Loyalist officer with the British Army wrote that Irvine was captured along with 23 of his men . For December 6 , Howard Peckham says that the Americans lost 30 killed , 40 wounded and 15 captured . The figure of 15 prisoners taken was confirmed by John Andr\u00e9 in his journal . For December 7 , Colonel John Laurens stated that \u201c the loss of Morgan 's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded \u201d , while John Donaldson , an American cavalryman wrote that \u201c Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & among them was Major Morris a brave & gallant officer \u201d This reference was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment , so Donaldson 's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan 's command , while Laurens ' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only . Benson Lossing confirms that \u201c twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan 's Corps \u201d , while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost \u201c 16 or 17 \u201d wounded . For December 8 , David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed or wounded and 15 prisoners . From these sources , the aggregate American loss from December 5 \u2013 8 would appear to have been 16 killed or wounded and 24 captured on the 5th ; 70 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 6th ; 44 killed or wounded on the 7th and 20 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 8th . This gives 150 killed or wounded and 54 captured , for a total loss of 204 men . Lord Cantelupe wrote in his diary that \" the number of killed & wounded on our side amount to one hundred & twenty , one officer killed . Cantelupe 's figure agrees approximately with Howe 's official casualty return for \u201c the different skirmishes from 4th to 8th December \u201d , which gives 19 killed , 60 wounded and 33 missing . David Martin gives the total British loss , including deserters , as 350 , which would suggest that 238 men deserted . = = Aftermath = = Washington , frustrated at not being able to confront Howe in a more decisive action , wrote in his report to Henry Laurens , president of Congress , \" I sincerely wish , that they had made an Attack ; the Issue in all probability , from the disposition of our Troops and the strong situation of our Camp , would have been fortunate and happy . At the same time I must add that reason , prudence , and every principle of policy , forbade us quitting our post to attack them . Nothing but Success would have justified the measure , and this could not be expected from their position . \" On December 11 , the Continental Army left White Marsh for Valley Forge . It took the soldiers eight days to make the 13-mile ( 21 km ) journey . The following April , Howe resigned his post and returned to Britain , and was replaced by Gen. Sir Henry Clinton . Following France 's entry into the war , the British evacuated Philadelphia overland the following spring , and while en route to New York City , they were attacked by Washington at the Battle of Monmouth . Remains of the American redoubts were visible near Farmar Mill , as were vestiges of stone chimneys from the soldier 's makeshift huts , as late as 1860 . The battle is alluded to in Sally Wister 's Journal , and the author later views the remains of the nearby camp . Fort Washington State Park , which encompasses a portion of the area occupied by the American forces , was established in the early 1920s by Philadelphia 's Fairmount Park Commission and is today managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources . The park 's Fort Hill marks the spot where a temporary fort once stood at the western end of the American position . The Pennsylvania Militia ( under Gens . Armstrong , Cadwalader and Irvine ) held positions on the park 's Militia Hill . Nearby , Emlen House , Washington 's headquarters between November 2 and December 11 , remains standing despite destructive modernization in 1854 .",

                    "text": "Saratoga campaign = The Saratoga Campaign in 1777 was an attempt by the British high command for North America to gain military control of the strategically important Hudson River valley during the American Revolutionary War . It ended in the surrender of the British army , which historian Edmund Morgan argues , \" was a great turning point of the war , because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory . The primary thrust of the campaign was planned and initiated by General John Burgoyne . Commanding a main force of some 8,000 men , he moved south in June from Quebec , boated up Lake Champlain to middle New York , then marched over the divide and down the Hudson Valley to Saratoga . He initially skirmished there with the Patriot defenders with mixed results . Then , after losses in the Battles of Saratoga in September and October , his deteriorating position and ever increasing size of the American army forced him to surrender his forces to the American General Horatio Gates on October 17 . The elaborate plans drawn up in London all failed . Colonel Barry St. Leger was assigned to move on Albany , New York east through the Mohawk River valley , but was forced to retreat during the siege of Fort Stanwix after losing his Indian allies . The major expedition from the south never materialized due to miscommunication with London when General William Howe sent his army to take Philadelphia rather than sending it up the Hudson River to coordinate with Burgoyne . A last-minute effort to reinforce Burgoyne from New York City was made in early October , but it was too little , too late . The American victory was an enormous morale boost to the fledgling nation . More important , it convinced France to enter the war in alliance with the United States , openly providing money , soldiers , and munitions , as well fighting a naval war worldwide against Britain . = = British strategy = = Toward the end of 1776 it was apparent to many in England that pacification of New England was very difficult due to the high concentration of Patriots ; and so London decided to isolate New England and concentrate on the central and southern regions where Loyalists supposedly could be rallied . In December 1776 General John Burgoyne met with Lord Germain , the British Secretary of State for the Colonies and the government official responsible for managing the war , to set strategy for 1777 . There were two main armies in North America to work with : General Guy Carleton 's army in Quebec and General William Howe 's army , which had driven George Washington 's army from New York City in the New York campaign . = = = Howe 's plan to attack Philadelphia = = = On November 30 , 1776 , Howe \u2014 the British commander-in-chief in North America \u2014 wrote to Germain , outlining an ambitious plan for the 1777 campaign . Howe said that if Germain sent him substantial reinforcements , he could launch multiple offensives , including sending 10,000 men up the Hudson River to take Albany , New York . Then , in the autumn , Howe could move south and capture the U.S. capital of Philadelphia . Howe soon changed his mind after writing this letter : the reinforcements might not arrive , and the retreat of the Continental Army over the winter of 1776 \u2013 77 made Philadelphia an increasingly vulnerable target . Therefore , Howe decided that he would make the capture Philadelphia the primary object of the 1777 campaign . Howe sent Germain this revised plan , which Germain received on February 23 , 1777 . = = = Burgoyne 's plan to capture Albany = = = Burgoyne , seeking to command a major force , proposed to isolate New England by an invasion from Quebec into New York . This had already been attempted by General Carleton in 1776 , although he had stopped short of a full-scale invasion due to the lateness of the season . Carleton was heavily criticized in London for not taking advantage of the American retreat from Quebec , and he was also intensely disliked by Germain . This , combined with rival Henry Clinton 's failed attempt to capture Charleston , South Carolina , placed Burgoyne in a good position to get command of the 1777 northern campaign . Burgoyne presented a written plan to Lord Germain on February 28 , 1777 ; Germain approved it and gave Burgoyne command of the main expedition . Burgoyne 's invasion plan from Quebec had two components : he would lead the main force of about 8,000 men south from Montreal along Lake Champlain and the Hudson River Valley while a second column of about 2,000 men ( which Barry St. Leger was chosen to lead ) , would move from Lake Ontario east down the Mohawk River valley in a strategic diversion . Both expeditions would converge upon Albany , where they would link up with troops from Howe 's army marching up the Hudson . Control of the Lake Champlain-Lake George-Hudson River route from Canada to New York City would cut off New England from the rest of the American colonies . The last part of Burgoyne 's proposal , the advance by Howe up the Hudson from New York City , proved to be the most controversial part of the campaign . Germain approved Burgoyne 's plan after having received Howe 's letter detailing his proposed offensive against Philadelphia . Whether Germain told Burgoyne , who was still in London at that time , about Howe 's revised plans is unclear : while some sources claim he did , others state that Burgoyne was not notified of the changes until the campaign was well underway . Historian Robert Ketchum believes that Burgoyne would probably have been aware of the problems that lay ahead had he been notified of the Philadelphia plan . Whether Germain , Howe , and Burgoyne had the same expectations about the degree to which Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear . What is clear is that Germain either left his generals with too much latitude , or without a clearly defined overall strategy . In March 1777 Germain had approved of Howe 's Philadelphia expedition and did not include any express orders for Howe to go to Albany . Yet Germain also sent Howe a copy of his instructions to Carleton which plainly stated that the northern army was to make a junction with Howe 's army at Albany . In a letter from Germain to Howe dated May 18 , 1777 he made clear that the Philadelphia expedition should \" be executed in time for you to co-operate with the army ordered to proceed from Canada and put itself under your command . \" This last letter , however , was not received by Howe until after he had departed New York for the Chesapeake . To attack Philadelphia Howe could either have moved overland through New Jersey or by sea via the Delaware Bay , both options would have kept him a position to aid Burgoyne if necessary . The final route he took , through the Chesapeake Bay , was immensely time-consuming and left him wholly unable to assist Burgoyne as Germain had envisioned . The decision was so difficult to understand that Howe 's more hostile critics accused him of deliberate treachery . Burgoyne returned to Quebec on May 6 , 1777 , bearing a letter from Lord Germain which introduced the plan but lacked some details . This produced another of the conflicts of command that plagued the British throughout the war . Lieutenant General Burgoyne technically outranked Major General Carleton , but Carleton was still the governor of Quebec . Germain 's instructions to Burgoyne and Carleton had specifically limited Carleton 's role to operations in Quebec . This slight against Carleton , combined with Carleton 's failure to get command of the expedition , led to his resignation later in 1777 , and to his refusal to supply troops from the Quebec regiments to garrison the forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga after they were captured . = = American strategy = = George Washington , whose army was encamped at Morristown , New Jersey , and the American military command did not have a good picture of British plans for 1777 . The principal question on the minds of Washington and his generals Horatio Gates and Philip Schuyler \u2014 who both were at turns responsible for the Continental Army 's Northern Department and its defense of the Hudson River \u2014 was of the movements of Howe 's army in New York . They had no significant knowledge of what was being planned for the British forces in Quebec , in spite of Burgoyne 's complaints that everyone in Montreal knew what he was planning . The three generals disagreed on what Burgoyne 's most likely movement was , and Congress also rendered the opinion that Burgoyne 's army was likely to move to New York by sea . Partly as a result of this indecision , and the fact that it would be isolated from its supply lines if Howe moved north , the garrisons at Fort Ticonderoga and elsewhere in the Mohawk and Hudson valleys were not significantly increased . Schuyler took the measure in April 1777 of sending a large regiment under Colonel Peter Gansevoort to rehabilitate Fort Stanwix in the upper Mohawk valley as a step in defending against British movements in that area . Washington also ordered four regiments to be held at Peekskill , New York that could be directed either to the north or the south in response to British movements . American troops were allocated throughout New York theater in June 1777 . About 1,500 troops ( including those of Colonel Gansevoort ) were in outposts along the Mohawk River , about 3,000 troops were in the Hudson River highlands under the command of General Israel Putnam , and Schuyler commanded about 4,000 troops ( inclusive of local militia and the troops at Ticonderoga under St. Clair ) . = = International interest = = Ever since the Seven Years ' War , France 's foreign ministers , beginning with Choiseul , had followed the general idea that the independence of Britain 's North American colonies would be good for France and bad for Britain , and furthermore that French attempts to recover parts of New France would be detrimental to that cause . When war broke out in 1775 , the Comte de Vergennes , then the Foreign Minister , outlined a series of proposals that led to secret French and also Spanish support of Congress , and some preparations for the possibility of war , including expansion of their navies . Vergennes did not think open participation in the war was diplomatically or politically feasible until Washington 's army demonstrated its strength and ability to gain military victories without significant assistance . To further the aim of French participation in the war , Vergennes closely monitored news from North America and London , and worked to remove impediments to Spanish participation in the war . Vergennes went so far as to propose war to King Louis XVI in August 1776 , but news of Howe 's capture of New York City scuttled that plan . = = Campaign begins = = Most of Burgoyne 's army had arrived in Quebec in the spring of 1776 , and participated in the routing of Continental Army troops from the province . In addition to British regulars , the troops in Quebec included several regiments from the German principalities of Hesse-Hanau ( from whose name the common reference of Hessian comes ) and Brunswick under the command of Baron Friedrich Adolph Riedesel . Of these regular forces , 200 British regulars and 300 to 400 Germans were assigned to St. Leger 's Mohawk valley expedition , and about 3,500 men remained in Quebec to protect the province . The remaining forces were assigned to Burgoyne for the campaign to Albany . The regular forces were supposed to be augmented by as many as 2,000 militia raised in Quebec ; by June , Carleton had managed to raise only three small companies . Burgoyne had also expected as many as 1,000 Indians to support the expedition . About 500 joined between Montreal and Crown Point . Burgoyne 's army was beset by transport difficulties before it left Quebec , something that apparently neither Burgoyne nor Carleton anticipated . As the expedition expected to travel mainly over water , there were few wagons , horses , and other draft animals available to move the large amount of equipment and supplies on the land portions of the route . Only in early June did Carleton issue orders to procure carts sufficient to move the army . Consequently , the carts were poorly constructed of green wood , and the teams were driven by civilians who were at a higher risk of desertion . On June 13 , 1777 , Burgoyne and Carleton reviewed the assembled forces at St. John 's on the Richelieu River , just north of Lake Champlain , and Burgoyne was ceremonially given command . In addition to five sailing ships built the previous year , a sixth had been built and three had been captured after the Battle of Valcour Island . These provided some transport as well as military cover for the large fleet of transport boats that moved the army south on the lake . The army that Burgoyne launched the next day had about 7,000 regulars and over 130 artillery pieces ranging from light mortars to 24 pound ( 11 kg ) pieces . His regulars were organized into an advance force under Brigadier General Simon Fraser , and two divisions . Major General William Phillips led the 3,900 British regulars on the right , while Baron Riedesel 's 3,100 Brunswickers and Hanauers held the left . His regular troops started out in good condition but some , notably some of the German dragoons , were poorly equipped for wilderness fighting . Colonel St. Leger 's expedition was also assembled by mid-June . His force , a mixed company of British regulars , Loyalists , Hessians , and rangers from the Indian department , numbering about 750 men left Lachine , near Montreal , on June 23 . = = Ticonderoga falls = = Burgoyne 's army traveled up the lake and occupied the undefended Fort Crown Point by June 30 . The screening activities of Burgoyne 's Indian support were highly effective at keeping the Americans from learning the details of his movements . General Arthur St. Clair , who had been left in command of Fort Ticonderoga and its surrounding defenses with a garrison of about 3,000 regulars and militia , had no idea on July 1 of the full strength of Burgoyne 's army , large elements of which were then just 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) away . St. Clair had been ordered by General Schuyler to hold out as long as possible , and had planned two avenues of retreat . Open skirmishing began on the outer defense works of Ticonderoga on July 2 . By July 4 , most of the American garrison was either at Fort Ticonderoga or nearby Mount Independence , the extensive fortifications on the Vermont side of the lake . Unknown to the Americans , their withdrawal from an outer defensive position cleared a way for the British to place artillery on the hilltop known then as Sugar Loaf ( now Mount Defiance ) , whose heights commanded the fort . St. Clair withdrew the night after spotting British cannon on Sugar Loaf on July 5 , and Burgoyne 's men occupied the main fortification and the positions on Mount Independence on July 6 . The uncontested surrender of the supposedly impregnable fort caused a public and political uproar . Although a later investigation cleared both Schuyler and St. Clair of any wrongdoing in the withdrawal , it caused the Continental Congress to replace Schuyler with General Horatio Gates as commander of the Northern Department of the Continental Army in August . Burgoyne sent forces out from his main body to pursue the retreating army , which St. Clair had sent south via two different routes . The British caught up with elements of the retreating Americans at least three times . General Fraser and elements of Baron Riedesel 's troops faced determined resistance in Battle of Hubbardton on July 7 , and a skirmish that same day between the vanguard of the main army met Pierse Long 's retreating companies in a skirmish at Skenesboro . These were followed by another standoff in the Battle of Fort Anne on July 8 , in which a forward company of the British army was nearly decimated . These actions cost the Americans about 50 % more casualties than those incurred by the British , and they demonstrated to the British officers present that the Americans were capable of putting up stiff resistance . Burgoyne 's army was reduced by about 1,500 men as a result of the Ticonderoga actions . He left 400 men to garrison the magazine at Crown Point and another 900 to defend Ticonderoga , and the battles that followed resulted in about 200 casualties . The bulk of St. Clair 's army retreated through the New Hampshire Grants ( present-day Vermont ) . St. Clair issued appeals to the states for militia support , and also arranged to have as much of the area 's livestock and supplies delivered to Fort Edward on the Hudson River , where the American armies would regroup . St. Clair reached Fort Edward on July 12 after five days of grueling marches . Some of the remnants that had been scattered at Hubbardton rejoined the army , but Seth Warner and the remains of his regiment were stationed at Manchester in the Grants . = = Reaction and delay = = Burgoyne settled into the house of Loyalist Philip Skene at Skenesboro while the pieces of his army regrouped and he considered his next steps . He penned letters describing the British victory , intended for public consumption . When this news reached the capitals of Europe , King George was happy , and the Comte de Vergennes was not , as the news effectively scuttled an early proposal for French entry into the war . British diplomats increased pressure on the French and Spanish , demanding that they close their ports to American shipping . While this demand was refused , it markedly increased the tensions between the powers . The news was also harshly received by Congress and the American public , including slanders that St. Clair and Schuyler had been bribed . On July 10 Burgoyne issued orders for the next series of movements . Most of the army was to take the rough road from Skenesboro to Fort Edward via Fort Anne , while the heavy artillery was to be transported down Lake George to Fort Edward . Riedesel 's troops were sent back up the road toward Castleton , primarily as a diversion intended to suggest that he might be aiming for the Connecticut River . Burgoyne 's decision to move the army overland via Fort Anne was a curious one , for it contradicted his own earlier commentaries on planning the expedition , in which he presciently observed that defenders could easily block the route . His decision appears to have been motivated by two factors ; the first being the perception that moving the army over water via Lake George would require a retrograde movement that could be perceived as a retreat , and the second being the influence of Philip Skene , whose property would benefit by the improved road Burgoyne would have to build . General Schuyler , at Albany when he received word of Ticonderoga 's fall , immediately rode to Fort Edward , where there was a garrison of about 700 regulars and 1,400 militia . He decided to make Burgoyne 's passage as difficult as possible , using the axe as a weapon ; as it was much easier to fell large trees in the enemy 's path than to remove them after they were down , this brought Burgoyne 's advance to a crawl , tiring his troops and forcing them to use up supplies . On July 11 Burgoyne wrote to Lord Germain , complaining that the Americans were systematically felling trees , destroying bridges , and damming streams along the road to Fort Edward . Schuyler also employed scorched earth tactics to deny the British access to local provisions . In spite of Burgoyne 's lack of movement , his scouts were active ; some of Schuyler 's work crews were attacked . Schuyler 's tactics required Burgoyne to build a road through the wilderness for his guns and troops , a task that took about two weeks . They moved out of Skenesboro on July 24 , and reached Fort Edward on July 29 , finding that Schuyler had already abandoned it , in a retreat that ended at Stillwater , New York . Before he left Skenesboro , Burgoyne was joined by about 500 Indians ( mostly Ottawas , but also Fox , Mississauga , Chippewa , and Ojibwe , as well as members of the Iroquois ) from the Great Lakes region under the leadership of St. Luc de la Corne and Charles Michel de Langlade . = = St. Leger 's expedition = = Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger sailed up the St. Lawrence and crossed Lake Ontario to arrive at Oswego without incident . He had about 300 regulars , supported by 650 Canadian and Loyalist militia , and they were joined by 1,000 Indians led by John Butler and the Iroquois war chiefs Joseph Brant , Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter . Leaving Oswego on July 25 , they marched to Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk River , and began besieging it on August 2 . About 800 members of the Tryon County militia and their Indian allies marched to relieve the siege , but some of St. Leger 's British and Indians ambushed them on August 6 at the bloody Battle of Oriskany . While the Americans held the field of battle , they retreated because of the heavy casualties they suffered , including the mortal wounding of their leader , General Nicholas Herkimer . Warriors from Iroquois nations fought on both sides of the battle , marking the beginning of a civil war within the Six Nations . During the Oriskany action , the besieged Americans staged a sortie from Fort Stanwix and raided the nearly empty Indian camp . Combined with the significant Indian casualties at Oriskany , this was a significant blow to Indian morale . On August 10 , Benedict Arnold left Stillwater , New York for Fort Stanwix with 800 men of the Continental Army from Schuyler 's Northern Department . He expected to recruit members of the Tryon County militia when he arrived at Fort Dayton on August 21 . Arnold could only raise about 100 militia , as most of the militia men that had been at Oriskany were not interested in joining , so he instead resorted to subterfuge . He staged the escape of a Loyalist captive , who convinced St. Leger that Arnold was coming with a much larger force than he actually had . On this news , Joseph Brant and the rest of St. Leger 's Indians withdrew . They took most of his remaining supplies with them , and St. Leger was forced to raise the siege and head back through Oswego to Quebec . Arnold sent a detachment a short way after them , and turned the rest of his force east to rejoin the American forces at Saratoga . St. Leger 's remaining men eventually arrived at Fort Ticonderoga on September 27 . Their arrival was too late to effectively support Burgoyne , whose army was already being hemmed in by the growing American forces around him . = = Mounting difficulties = = The advance of Burgoyne 's army to Fort Edward was , as with the approach to Ticonderoga , preceded by a wave of Indians , which chased away the small contingent of troops left there by Schuyler . These allies became impatient and began indiscriminate raids on frontier families and settlements , which had the effect of increasing rather than reducing local support to the American rebels . In particular , the death at Indian hands of the attractive young Loyalist settler Jane McCrea was widely publicized and served as a catalyst for rebel support , as Burgoyne 's decision to not punish the perpetrators was seen as unwillingness or inability to keep the Indians under control . Even though the bulk of his army made the trip from Skenesboro to Fort Edward in just five days , the army 's lack of adequate transport served to delay the army again , as the supply train , hampered by a lack of draft animals and carts and wagons that were capable of dealing with the rough tracks through the wilderness , took time to follow . On August 3 , messengers from General Howe finally succeeded in making their way through the American lines to Burgoyne 's camp at Fort Edward . ( Numerous attempts by the British generals to communicate were frustrated by the capture and hanging of their messengers by the Americans . ) The messengers did not bring good news . On July 17 Howe wrote that he was preparing to depart by sea with his army to capture Philadelphia , and that General Clinton , responsible for New York City 's defense , would \" act as occurrences may direct \" . Burgoyne refused to divulge the contents of this dispatch to his staff . Realizing that he now had a serious supply problem , Burgoyne decided to act on a suggestion that Baron Riedesel had made to him in July . Riedesel , whose forces Burgoyne had stationed at Castleton for a time while he was at Skenesboro , had observed that the area was rich in draft animals and horses , which might be seized for the army 's benefit ( including the mounting of Riedesel 's currently unmounted dragoons ) . Pursuing this idea , Burgoyne sent Colonel Friedrich Baum 's regiment toward western Massachusetts and the New Hampshire Grants on August 9 , along with some Brunswick dragoons . Most of Baum 's detachment never returned from the August 16 Battle of Bennington , and the reinforcements he had sent after them came back after they were ravaged in the same battle , which deprived Burgoyne of nearly 1,000 men and the much-needed supplies . What Burgoyne had been unaware of was that St. Clair 's calls for militia support following the withdrawal from Ticonderoga had been answered , and General John Stark had placed 2,000 men at Bennington . Stark 's force enveloped Baum 's at Bennington , killing him and capturing much of his detachment . The death of Jane McCrea and the Battle of Bennington , besides acting as rallying cries for the Americans , had another important effect . Burgoyne blamed his Indian and Canadian allies for McCrea 's death , and , even after the Indians had lost 80 of their number at Bennington , Burgoyne showed them no gratitude . As a result , Langlade , La Corne , and most of the Indians left the British camp , leaving Burgoyne with fewer than 100 Indian scouts . Burgoyne was left with no protection in the woods against the American rangers . Burgoyne would later blame La Corne for deserting him , while La Corne countered that Burgoyne never respected the Indians . In the British Parliament , Lord Germain sided with La Corne . = = American change of fortune = = While the tactic of delay worked well in the field , the result in the Continental Congress was a different matter . General Horatio Gates was in Philadelphia when Congress discussed its shock at the fall of Ticonderoga , and Gates was more than willing to help assign the blame to reluctant generals . Some in the Congress had already been impatient with General George Washington , wanting a large , direct confrontation that might eliminate occupation forces but which Washington feared would probably lose the war . John Adams , the head of the War Committee , praised Gates and remarked that \" we shall never hold a post until we shoot a general . \" Over the objections of the New York delegation , Congress sent Gates to take command of the Northern Department on August 10 . It also ordered states from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts to call out their militias . On August 19 , Gates arrived at Albany to take charge . He was cold and arrogant in manner , and pointedly excluded Schuyler from his first war council . Schuyler left for Philadelphia shortly after , depriving Gates of his intimate knowledge of the area . Throughout the month of August , and continuing into September , militia companies arrived at the Continental Army camps on the Hudson . These were augmented by troops Washington ordered north from the Hudson Highlands as part of General Arnold 's operation to relieve Stanwix . Those troops arrived at the end of August and included the crack sharpshooters of Daniel Morgan 's rifle corps , which he sent north from his own army . News of the American successes at Bennington and Fort Stanwix , combined with outrage over the death of Jane McCrea , rallied support , swelling Gates ' army to over 6,000 rank and file . This number did not include Stark 's small army at Bennington , which was reduced in size by disease and the departure of some of its companies , but was also augmented by several hundred troops raised by General Benjamin Lincoln , who was assigned to make attacks against Burgoyne 's supply and communications . = = Saratoga = = The \" Battle of Saratoga \" is often depicted as a single event , but it was actually a month-long series of maneuvers punctuated by two battles . At the beginning of September 1777 , Burgoyne 's army , now just over 7,000 strong , was located on the east bank of the Hudson . He had learned of St. Leger 's failure at Stanwix on August 28 , and even earlier that Howe would not be giving him substantial support from New York City . Faced with the need to reach defensible winter quarters , which would require either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany , he decided on the latter . Subsequent to this decision , he made two further crucial decisions . He decided to deliberately cut communications to the north , so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga , and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position . He therefore ordered Riedesel , whose forces were in the rear , to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south , and ordered the army to cross the river just north of Saratoga , which it did between September 13 and 15 . Moving cautiously , since the departure of his Indian support had deprived him of reliable scouting , Burgoyne advanced to the south . On September 18 the vanguard of his army had reached a position just north of Saratoga , about 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) from the American defensive line , and skirmishes occurred between the leading elements of the armies . When Gates took over Schuyler 's army , much of it was located near the mouth of the Mohawk River , south of Stillwater . On September 8 he ordered the army , then about 10,000 men ( of whom about 8,500 were effective combat troops ) , to Stillwater with the idea of setting up defenses there . The Polish engineer Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko found the area inadequate for proper defensive works , so a new location was found about three miles further north ( and about 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Saratoga ) . At this location Kosciusko laid out defensive lines stretching from the river to the bluffs called Bemis Heights . The right side of these defenses was nominally given to General Lincoln , but as he was leading troops intended for a diversion against Ticonderoga , Gates assumed command of that portion of the line himself . Gates put General Arnold , with whom he had previously had a good relationship , in command of the army 's left , the western defenses on Bemis Heights . The relationship between the two soured when Arnold chose to staff his command with friends of Schuyler , whom Gates hated . Combined with the prickly natures of both Gates and Arnold , this eventually brought internal power squabbles to a boil . = = = Freeman 's Farm = = = Both Generals Burgoyne and Arnold recognized the importance of the American left flank . Burgoyne recognized that the American position could be flanked , and divided his forces , sending a large detachment to the west on September 19 . Arnold , also recognizing that a British attack on the left was likely , asked Gates for permission to move his forces out to Freeman 's Farm to anticipate that maneuver . Gates refused to carry out a general movement , since he wanted to wait behind his defenses for the expected frontal attack ; but he did permit Arnold to send Daniel Morgan 's riflemen and some light infantry out for a reconnaissance in force . These forces precipitated the Battle of Freeman 's Farm when they made contact with Burgoyne 's right flank . In the ensuing battle , the British gained control of Freeman 's Farm , but at the cost of 600 casualties , ten percent of their forces . After the battle the feud between Gates and Arnold erupted . Not only did Gates not mention Arnold at all in the official account of the battle he sent to Congress , but he also transferred Morgan 's company ( which had been technically independent but operated under Arnold 's command in the battle ) to his direct command . Arnold and Gates had a noisy argument in Gates ' quarters , in which Gates said that General Lincoln would be replacing him . Following the argument Arnold drafted a letter to Gates outlining his grievances and requesting a transfer to Washington 's command . Gates gave Arnold a pass to leave , and continued to inflict petty indignities on Arnold . A commonly referenced reason why Arnold chose to remain is that a petition signed by all of the line officers except Gates and Lincoln convinced him to stay . While proposals for such a document were considered , there is no contemporary evidence of one actually being drafted and signed . Burgoyne considered renewing the attack the next day , but called it off when Fraser noted that many men were fatigued from the previous day 's exertions . He therefore dug his army in , and waited for news that he would receive some assistance from the south , as a letter he received from General Clinton in New York on September 21 suggested that a movement up the Hudson would draw off some of Gates ' army . Although he was aware of the persistent desertions that were reducing the size of his army and that the army was running short of food and other critical supplies , he did not know that the American army was also daily growing in size , or that Gates had intelligence on how dire the situation was in his camp . = = = Attack on Ticonderoga = = = Unknown to either side at Saratoga until after the battle , General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British position at Fort Ticonderoga . Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September . After marching north to Pawlet , they received word that the guard at Ticonderoga might be susceptible to surprise . Lincoln sent three detachments of 500 men each to \" annoy , divide , and distract the enemy . \" One went to Skenesboro , which was found to be abandoned by the British . The second went to capture Mount Independence on the east side of Lake Champlain , while the third , led by John Brown , made the approach to Ticonderoga . On the morning of September 18 , Brown surprised the British defenders at the southern end of the portage trail connecting Lake George to Lake Champlain . Rapidly moving up the trail his men continued to surprise British defenders and capture artillery pieces until they reached the height of land just before Ticonderoga , where they occupied the \" old French lines \" ( so named because it was there that a French defense improbably held against a much larger British army in the 1758 Battle of Carillon ) . On the way he released 100 prisoners ( thus increasing the size of his force ) and captured nearly 300 . His demand for the fort 's surrender was refused , and for the next four days Brown 's men and the fort exchanged cannon fire , to little effect . Since he had insufficient manpower to actually assault the fort , Brown then withdrew to Lake George , where he made an unsuccessful attempt to capture a storage depot on an island in the lake . General Gates wrote to Lincoln on the day of Freeman 's Farm , ordering his force back to Saratoga and that \" not one moment should be lost \" . Lincoln reached Bemis Heights on September 22 , but the last of his troops did not arrive until the 29th . = = = Sir Henry Clinton attempts a diversion = = = General Howe , when he left New York for Philadelphia , had put General Sir Henry Clinton in charge of New York 's defense , with instructions to assist Burgoyne if opportunities arose . Clinton wrote to Burgoyne on September 12 that he would \" make a push at [ Fort ] Montgomery in about ten days \" if \" you think 2000 men can assist you effectually . \" When Burgoyne received the letter he immediately replied , appealing to Clinton for instruction on whether he should attempt to advance or retreat , based on the likelihood of Clinton 's arrival at Albany for support . Burgoyne indicated that if he did not receive a response by October 12 he would be forced to retreat . On October 3 , Clinton sailed up the Hudson River with 3,000 men , and on October 6 , one day after receiving Burgoyne 's appeal , captured the highland forts named Clinton and Montgomery . Burgoyne never received Clinton 's dispatches following this victory , as all three messengers were captured . Clinton followed up the victory by dismantling the chain across the Hudson , and sent a raiding force up the river that reached as far north as Livingston Manor on October 16 before turning back . Word of Clinton 's movements only reached Gates after the battle of Bemis Heights . = = = Bemis Heights = = = In addition to the Lincoln 's 2,000 men , militia units poured into the American camp , swelling the American army to over 15,000 men . Burgoyne , who had put his army on short rations on October 3 , called a council the next day . The decision of this meeting was to launch a reconnaissance in force of about 1,700 men toward the American left flank . Burgoyne and Fraser led this detachment out early on the afternoon of October 7 . Their movements were spotted , and Gates wanted to order only Daniel Morgan 's men out in opposition . Arnold said that this was clearly insufficient , and that a large force had to be sent . Gates , put off one last time by Arnold 's tone , dismissed him , saying , \" You have no business here . \" However , Gates did accede to similar advice given by Lincoln . In addition to sending Morgan 's company around the British right , he also sent Enoch Poor 's brigade against Burgoyne 's left . When Poor 's men made contact , the Battle of Bemis Heights was underway . The initial American attack was highly effective , and Burgoyne attempted to order a withdrawal , but his aide was shot down before the order could be broadcast . In intense fighting , the flanks of Burgoyne 's force were exposed , while the Brunswickers at the center held against Learned 's determined attack . General Fraser was mortally wounded in this phase of the battle . While frequently claimed to be the work of Timothy Murphy , one of Morgan 's men , the story appears to be a 19th-century fabrication . After Fraser 's fall and the arrival of additional American troops , Burgoyne ordered what was left of the force to retreat behind their entrenched lines . General Arnold , frustrated by the sound of fighting he was not involved in , rode off from the American headquarters to join the fray . Arnold , who some claimed was in a drunken fury , took the battle to the British position . The right side of the British line consisted of two earthen redoubts that had been erected on Freeman 's Farm , and were manned by Brunswickers under Heinrich Breymann and light infantry under Lord Balcarres . Arnold first rallied troops to attack Balcarres ' redoubt , without success . He then boldly rode through the gap between the two redoubts , a space guarded by a small company of Canadian irregulars . Learned 's men followed , and made an assault on the open rear of Breymann 's redoubt . Arnold 's horse was shot out from under him , pinning him and breaking his leg . Breymann was killed in the fierce action , and his position was taken . However , night was falling , and the battle came to an end . The battle was a bloodbath for Burgoyne 's troops : nearly 900 men were killed , wounded , or captured , compared to about 150 for the Americans . = = Surrender = = Simon Fraser died of his wounds early the next day , but it was not until nearly sunset that he was buried . Burgoyne then ordered the army , whose entrenchments had been subjected to persistent harassment by the Americans , to retreat . ( One consequence of the skirmishing was that General Lincoln was also wounded . Combined with Arnold 's wounds , this deprived Gates of his top two field commanders . ) It took the army nearly two days to reach Saratoga , in which heavy rain and American probes against the column slowed the army 's pace . Burgoyne was aided by logistical problems in the American camp , where the army 's ability to move forward was hampered by delays in bringing forward and issuing rations . However , Gates did order detachments to take positions on the east side of the Hudson to oppose any attempted crossings . By the morning of October 13 Burgoyne 's army was completely surrounded , so his council voted to open negotiations . Terms were agreed on October 16 that Burgoyne insisted on calling a \" convention \" rather than a capitulation . Baroness Riedesel , wife of the commander of the German troops , vividly describes in her journal the confusion and besetting starvation of the retreating British army . Her account of the tribulation and death of officers and men , and of the terrified women who had taken shelter in the cellar of what later became known as the Marshall House dramatizes the desperation of the besieged army . On October 17 , following a ceremony in which Burgoyne gave his sword to Gates , only to have it returned , Burgoyne 's army ( approaching 6,000 strong ) marched out to surrender their arms while the American musicians played \" Yankee Doodle \" . = = Aftermath = = British troops withdrew from Ticonderoga and Crown Point in November , and Lake Champlain was free of British troops by early December . American troops , on the other hand , still had work to do . Alerted to General Clinton 's raids on the Hudson , most of the army marched south toward Albany on October 18 , while other detachments accompanied the \" Convention Army \" east . Burgoyne and Riedesel became guests of General Schuyler , who had come north from Albany to witness the surrender . Burgoyne was allowed to return to England on parole in May 1778 , where he spent the next two years defending his actions in Parliament and the press . He was eventually exchanged for more than 1,000 American prisoners . In response to Burgoyne 's surrender , Congress declared December 18 , 1777 as a national day \" for solemn Thanksgiving and praise \" in recognition of the military success at Saratoga ; it was the nation 's first official observance of a holiday with that name . = = = Convention Army = = = Under the terms of the convention Burgoyne 's army was to march to Boston , where British ships would transport it back to England , on condition that its members not participate in the conflict until they were formally exchanged . Congress demanded that Burgoyne provide a list of troops in the army so that the terms of the agreement concerning future combat could be enforced . When he refused , Congress decided not to honor the terms of the convention , and the army remained in captivity . The army was kept for some time in sparse camps throughout New England . Although individual officers were exchanged , much of the \" Convention Army \" was eventually marched south to Virginia , where it remained prisoner for several years . Throughout its captivity , a large number of men ( more than 1,300 in the first year alone ) escaped and effectively deserted , settling in the United States . = = Consequences = = On December 4 , 1777 , word reached Benjamin Franklin at Versailles that Philadelphia had fallen and that Burgoyne had surrendered . Two days later , King Louis XVI assented to negotiations for an alliance . The treaty was signed on February 6 , 1778 , and France declared war on Britain one month later , with hostilities beginning with naval skirmishes off Ushant in June . Spain did not enter into the war until 1779 , when it entered the war as an ally of France pursuant to the secret Treaty of Aranjuez . Vergennes ' diplomatic moves following the French entry into the war also had material impact on the later entry of the Dutch Republic into the war , and declarations of neutrality on the part of other important geopolitical players like Russia . The British government of Lord North came under sharp criticism when the news of Burgoyne 's surrender reached London . Of Lord Germain it was said that \" the secretary is incapable of conducting a war \" , and Horace Walpole opined ( incorrectly , as it turned out ) that \" we are ... very near the end of the American war . \" Lord North issued a proposal for peace terms in Parliament that did not include independence ; when these were finally delivered to Congress by the Carlisle Peace Commission they were rejected . = = Remembrances = = Most of the battlefields of the campaign have been preserved in some way , usually as state or national parks , but also as historic sites under state or federal control . Some monuments erected to mark the battles are listed as National Historic Landmarks and some are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Many of the battles are regularly reenacted , and the Battle of Bennington ( although it was actually fought in present-day Walloomsac , New York ) is marked in the state of Vermont by Bennington Battle Day . The commemorations of Benedict Arnold 's contributions to the American success of the campaign are particularly noteworthy . The obelisk at Saratoga National Historical Park has , on three of its four sides , alcoves bearing statues of three generals instrumental in the success at Saratoga : Gates , Schuyler , and Morgan . The fourth alcove , representing Arnold , is empty . The park also contains the Boot Monument which , though again without identifying Arnold by name , clearly honors his contribution in the second Saratoga battle .",

                    "text": "Battle of Marston Moor = The Battle of Marston Moor was fought on 2 July 1644 , during the First English Civil War of 1642 \u2013 1646 . The combined forces of the English Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax and the Earl of Manchester and the Scottish Covenanters under the Earl of Leven defeated the Royalists commanded by Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the Marquess of Newcastle . During the summer of 1644 , the Covenanters and Parliamentarians had been besieging York , which was defended by the Marquess of Newcastle . Rupert had gathered an army which marched through the northwest of England , gathering reinforcements and fresh recruits on the way , and across the Pennines to relieve the city . The convergence of these forces made the ensuing battle the largest of the civil wars . On 1 July , Rupert outmanoeuvred the Covenanters and Parliamentarians to relieve the city . The next day , he sought battle with them even though he was outnumbered . He was dissuaded from attacking immediately and during the day both sides gathered their full strength on Marston Moor , an expanse of wild meadow west of York . Towards evening , the Covenanters and Parliamentarians themselves launched a surprise attack . After a confused fight lasting two hours , Parliamentarian cavalry under Oliver Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry from the field and , with Leven 's infantry , annihilated the remaining Royalist infantry . After their defeat the Royalists effectively abandoned Northern England , losing much of the manpower from the northern counties of England ( which were strongly Royalist in sympathy ) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast . Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories later in the year in Southern England , the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year , when they tried unsuccessfully to link up with the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose . = = Background = = = = = The civil war in the north = = = In Northern England , the Royalists had the advantage in numbers and local support , except in parts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire , where the Parliamentarians had support from the clothing-manufacturing towns which \" naturally maligned the gentry \" . On 30 June 1643 , the Royalists commanded by the Marquess of Newcastle defeated the Parliamentarian army of Lord Fairfax at the Battle of Adwalton Moor near Bradford . Fairfax and his son , Sir Thomas Fairfax , fled with their remaining forces to the port of Hull , which was held for Parliament . Newcastle sent some of his army south into Lincolnshire , as part of a planned \" three-pronged \" advance on London , but was forced to besiege Hull with most of his forces . The siege failed , as the Parliamentarian navy could supply and reinforce the port and the garrison flooded wide areas around the city , while the Royalist detachments sent into Lincolnshire were defeated at the Battle of Gainsborough and the Battle of Winceby . In late 1643 , the English Civil War widened . King Charles I negotiated a \" cessation \" in Ireland , which allowed him to reinforce his armies with English regiments ( one of horse and twelve of foot ) which had been sent to Ireland following the Irish Rebellion of 1641 , but Parliament took an even greater step by signing the Solemn League and Covenant , sealing an alliance with the Scottish Covenanters . Early in 1644 , a Covenanter army under the Earl of Leven entered the north of England on behalf of the English Parliament . The Marquess of Newcastle was forced to divide his army , leaving a detachment under Sir John Belasyse to watch the Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax in Hull , while he led his main body north to confront Leven . = = = Siege of York = = = During March and early April , the Marquess of Newcastle fought several delaying actions as he tried to prevent the Scots from crossing the River Tyne and surrounding the city of Newcastle upon Tyne . Meanwhile , a Parliamentarian cavalry force under Sir Thomas Fairfax , who had been campaigning in Cheshire and Lancashire during the winter , crossed the Pennines and entered the West Riding of Yorkshire . To prevent Sir Thomas rejoining Lord Fairfax in Hull , Belasyse occupied the town of Selby which lay between them . On 11 April , Sir Thomas Fairfax 's force , reinforced by infantry under Sir John Meldrum , stormed Selby , capturing Belasyse and most of his force . Hearing the news , Newcastle realised that the city of York was in danger . York was the principal city and bastion of Royalist power in the north of England , and its loss would be a serious blow to the Royalist cause . He hastily retreated there to forestall the Fairfaxes . Leven left a detachment to mask the Royalist garrison of Newcastle upon Tyne , and followed Newcastle 's army with his main body . On 22 April , Leven and the Fairfaxes joined forces at Wetherby , about 14 miles ( 23 km ) west of York . Together , they began the Siege of York . Initially , the siege was a rather loose blockade as the Covenanters and Parliamentarians concentrated on capturing smaller Royalist garrisons which threatened their communications with Hull . On 3 June , they were reinforced by the Parliamentarian army of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester . York was now completely encircled and siege operations began in earnest . Leven was accepted as commander in chief of the three combined allied armies before York ( referred to by Parliament as the \" Army of Both Kingdoms \" ) . It was politic to make the Scottish Covenanters pre-eminent in the north as they were the largest single contingent in the army , but Leven was also a respected veteran of the Thirty Years ' War . = = = Relief moves = = = News of the siege soon reached Oxford , where King Charles had his wartime capital . From 24 April to 5 May , he held a council of war attended by his nephew and most renowned field commander , Prince Rupert . It was settled that while Charles attempted to play for time in Oxford , Rupert would relieve York . Rupert set out from Shrewsbury with a small force on 16 May . His first moves were intended to gather reinforcements along the way to bolster his army , and secure Lancashire for the troops heading over from Ireland for the Royalist cause . He assumed the direction of a small Royalist army , based on Chester and commanded by Lord John Byron , raising his force to 2,000 horse and 6,000 foot . Having forced a crossing of the River Mersey at Stockport , he stormed Bolton , allegedly killing 1,600 of the Parliamentarian defenders and citizens . Resting at Bury nearby , Rupert was joined by the Marquess of Newcastle 's cavalry under Lord George Goring , which had broken out of York early in the siege , with a small contingent from Derbyshire , and several regiments which were being freshly raised in Lancashire by the Earl of Derby . Bypassing the Parliamentarian stronghold of Manchester , Rupert approached Liverpool on 6 June and wrested control of the city from Parliament after a five-day siege . Rupert now hesitated , unsure whether to proceed to the relief of York or remain to consolidate the Royalist hold on Lancashire , securing more reinforcements in the process . He also distrusted some of the members of Charles 's council of war and was wary of being so far from the King 's side . On 16 June , he received a dispatch from the King which contained troubling news . The King 's advisors on the council of war had overturned Rupert 's defensive policies , sending the garrisons of Reading and Abingdon on an offensive in the West Country . This had left Oxford exposed to a sudden threat from the Parliamentarian armies commanded by the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller and forced the King to leave the city in haste and head to Worcester , where he was still in danger . The letter also contained some ambiguous orders regarding Rupert 's northern offensive and future plans : But now I must give the true state of my affairs , which , if their condition be such as enforces me to give you more peremptory commands than I would willingly do , you must not take it ill . If York be lost I shall esteem my crown little less ; unless supported by your sudden march to me ; and a miraculous conquest in the South , before the effects of the Northern power can be found here . But if York be relieved , and you beat the rebels ' army of both kingdoms , which are before it , then ( but otherwise not ) I may possibly make a shift upon the defensive to spin out time until you come to assist me . Wherefore I command and conjure you , by the duty and affection that I know you bear me , that all new enterprises laid aside , you immediately march according to your first intention , with all your force to the relief of York . But if that be either lost , or have freed themselves from the besiegers , or that for want of powder , you cannot undertake that work , that you immediately march with your whole strength , directly to Worcester to assist me and my army ; without which , or you having relieved York by beating the Scots , all the successes you can afterwards have must infallibly be useless onto me . Rupert understood the letter to be an order both to relieve York and defeat the allied army before heading south once more to aid the King . By this time Rupert 's army numbered nearly 14,000 . He set out from Liverpool to Preston , which surrendered without a fight . From there he proceeded via Clitheroe and crossed the Pennines to Skipton , where he paused for three days from 26 June to 28 June to \" fix arms \" and await some final reinforcements from Cumberland and Westmoreland . He arrived at the Royalist garrison at Knaresborough Castle 14 miles ( 23 km ) northwest of York on 30 June . = = = Relief of York = = = The allies were aware of Rupert 's approach and had been hoping that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat , but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time . The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers , and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army before the other two could come to its aid . Therefore , they abandoned the siege on the night of 30 June , and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor , where they blocked Rupert 's expected direct march to York ( along the old Roman road named Ermine Street , the modern A59 ) , and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby . Early on 1 July , some Royalist cavalry advanced from Knaresborough and appeared on the Moor , and the allies prepared for battle . However , Rupert had made a 22-mile ( 35 km ) flank march to the northeast with his main body , crossing the River Ure at Boroughbridge and the River Swale at Thornton Bridge . These two rivers merge to form the River Ouse , which Rupert had successfully put between himself and the allied armies . Later that day , his forces defeated the Earl of Manchester 's dragoons , who had been left to guard a bridge of boats across the Ouse at the village of Poppleton a few miles north of York . This had been the only crossing available to the allies above another bridge of boats at Acaster Malbis 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) south of York , and its capture prevented the allies crossing the Ouse to engage Rupert . More of Rupert 's cavalry arrived at York to gain touch with the garrison . With York definitely relieved , Newcastle sent Rupert a fulsome letter of welcome and congratulations . Rupert replied , not in person but through Goring , with a peremptory demand for Newcastle to march his forces to Rupert 's assistance on the following morning . = = Battle = = = = = Prelude = = = On learning that they had been outmanoeuvred , the allied commanders debated their options . They decided to march south to Tadcaster and Cawood , where they could both protect their own supply lines from Hull , and also block any move south by Rupert on either side of the Ouse . Their foot ( infantry ) , ordnance and baggage set off early on 2 July , leaving the cavalry and dragoons , commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax , as rearguard . At about 9 am , the allied generals learned that Rupert 's army had crossed the captured bridge of boats at Poppleton , and was advancing onto Marston Moor . The Covenanter and Parliamentarian foot , some of whom had already reached Tadcaster , were hastily recalled . However , Newcastle and his Lieutenant General , Lord Eythin , were opposed to any pitched battle and possibly offended by Rupert 's high-handed attitude . Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised , claiming that it would take time to clear the earth and rubble which had been used to block the city gates of York during the siege . Newcastle 's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment , a dispute which Eythin may have fomented . A number were also absent , pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city , and had yet to return . Around midday , Rupert was joined on Marston Moor by Newcastle , accompanied by a mounted troop of \" gentleman volunteers \" only . Rupert greeted him by saying , \" My Lord , I wish you had come sooner with your forces , but I hope we shall yet have a glorious day . \" Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies , with separate garrisons , recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect , would eventually separate . He also suggested waiting for a force of 3,000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2,000 to join the Royalist army . Rupert was adamant that the King 's letter ( which he never showed to Newcastle ) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately . Furthermore , Rupert wished to compensate for the Royalists ' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares , and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers . However , without Newcastle 's infantry , and with his own infantry exhausted from their long march on the previous day , Rupert was unable to attack , and the odds against him lengthened as the day wore on , and the Scots and Parliamentarian infantry and artillery returned from their aborted move south and took position . At about 2 : 00 pm , the allied artillery , consisting of around thirty pieces of ordnance commanded by General Alexander Hamilton , began a cannonade . However , at about 5 : 00 pm , the firing ceased . Meanwhile , at about 4 : 00 pm , the Royalist contingent from York belatedly arrived , led by Eythin . Rupert and Eythin already knew and disliked one another . Both had fought at the Battle of Vlotho in 1638 , where Rupert had been captured and held prisoner for several years . Rupert blamed Eythin 's caution for the defeat on that occasion , while Eythin blamed Rupert 's rashness . On the Moor , Eythin criticised Rupert 's dispositions as being drawn up too close to the enemy . His main concern was that a fold in the ground ( referred to by some eyewitnesses as a \" glen \" ) between the ridge on which the allied forces were drawn up and the track between Long Marston and Tockwith concealed the front line of the allied infantry from both view and artillery fire , allowing them to attack suddenly from a comparatively close distance . When Rupert proposed to either attack or move his army back as Eythin suggested , Eythin then pontificated that it was too late in the day for such a move . The Royalist army prepared to settle down for the night , close to the allied armies . = = = Deployment = = = = = = = Covenanters and Parliamentarians = = = = The Covenanters and Parliamentarians occupied Marston Hill , a low feature ( actually part of a terminal moraine ) less than 100 feet ( 30 m ) above the surrounding countryside but nevertheless prominent in the flat Vale of York , between the villages of Long Marston and Tockwith . They had the advantage of the higher ground , but cornfields stretching between the two villages hampered their deployment . At some point in the day , the Royalists attempted to seize a rabbit warren to the west of the cornfields from where they might enfilade the Parliamentarian position , but they were driven off and the Parliamentarian left wing of horse occupied the ground . The wing was under the command of Manchester 's Lieutenant General , Oliver Cromwell . The first two lines consisted of over 3,000 cavalry from the Eastern Association , including Cromwell 's own double-strength regiment of ironsides . They were deployed in eleven divisions of three or four troops of cavalry each , with 600 \" commanded \" musketeers deployed as platoons between them . The use of musketeers to disrupt attacking cavalry or dragoons was a common practice in the Swedish Army during the Thirty Years ' War , and was adopted by both the Parliamentarians and Royalists at Marston Moor . Three regiments of Covenanter horse , numbering 1,000 and mounted on lighter \" nags \" , formed a third line to Cromwell 's rear under Sir David Leslie . Five hundred Scottish dragoons under Colonel Hugh Fraser were deployed on the extreme left . The centre , under the direction of the Earl of Leven as nominated commander in chief , consisted of over 14,000 foot , with 30 to 40 pieces of artillery . Thomas Stockdale recorded the disposition of the troops and the role of Leven in drawing up the order of battle : The Yorkeshire forces strengthened with a great party of the Scotts army hauing the main battle , the Earl of Manchester \u2019 s forces the left wing , and the Scotts the right wing , each battle hauing severall reserues and winged with horse , according to Generall Lesleys direction whose great experience did worthyly challenge the prime power in ordering them . The Covenanter Sergeant Major General of Foot , James Lumsden , nevertheless noted ( in a note on the map he made of the allied army 's dispositions ) that \" ... the Brigads drawen up heir as we [ illegible ] it is not so formal as it ought to be . \" Most of Manchester 's infantry under Sergeant Major General Lawrence Crawford were on the left of the front line . A brigade of Lord Fairfax 's foot was in the centre . Two Covenanter brigades each of two regiments , the \" vanguard \" of the main battalia commanded by Lieutenant General William Baillie , made up the right of the front line . The second line consisted of four Covenanter brigades , their \" main battle \" , commanded by Lumsden . There is confusion as to the disposition of the third line and of the infantry deployment on the right wing , as the only map ( Lumsden 's ) is badly damaged . The usual interpretation , based on Peter Young 's reconstruction , is that the third line contained two or three Covenanter brigades and the Earl of Manchester 's own regiment of foot . Young placed the main body of Fairfax 's foot on the left of the third line , although more recent interpretations of accounts put them on the right of the third line or even behind the cavalry of the right wing . An unbrigaded Covenanter regiment may have formed an incomplete fourth line . ( There were a total of nineteen Covenanter regiments of foot , some of them incomplete , present at the battle . ) The right wing was commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax , with John Lambert as his second in command . He had at least 2,000 horse from Yorkshire and Lancashire , deployed in nine divisions , with 600 musketeers posted between them in the same manner as on the left wing . There were also perhaps 500 dragoons . One regiment of Covenanter horse commanded by the Earl of Eglinton was deployed with Fairfax 's front line , two more ( one of them composed of lancers commanded by the Earl of Balgonie , Leven 's son ) were deployed behind Fairfax 's second line . The second and third lines of the right wing may also have included some units of foot , whose identity is uncertain . = = = = Royalists = = = = The Royalists occupied the low-lying moor , behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted as an effective obstacle to a cavalry charge . There is some dispute over the course of the ditch at the time of the battle . Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists ' right wing . On the other hand , a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert 's chief engineer , Bernard de Gomme , shows the ditch in its present-day alignment . It is generally accepted that the ditch was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right . The Royalist left wing was commanded by Lord Goring . It consisted of 1,700 cavalry from the Marquess of Newcastle 's cavalry ( the \" Northern Horse \" ) , 400 cavalry from Derbyshire and 500 musketeers . The first line was commanded by Goring and the second by Sir Charles Lucas . Their centre was commanded by Eythin . A brigade numbering 1,500 and consisting of Rupert 's and Byron 's regiments of foot under Colonel Robert Napier of Byron 's regiment was deployed at the ditch , at the junction of the right wing and centre , possibly to protect some artillery which may have occupied a slight hummock near this point . To their left , a forlorn hope of musketeers lined the ditch . Behind them , the first line and the left wing of the second line were composed of the remaining infantry units of Rupert 's army , numbering 5,500 , under Rupert 's Sergeant Major General , Henry Tillier . The 3,000 infantry from Newcastle 's army under Sergeant Major General Francis Mackworth formed the right wing of the second line and an incomplete third line behind the right centre when they arrived , though some at least of them may not have taken up their assigned positions when the battle began , leaving the right of the Royalist centre understrength . A brigade of 600 \" Northern Horse \" under Sir William Blakiston was deployed behind the left centre . A total of 14 field guns were deployed in the centre . The right wing was commanded by Byron , with 2,600 horse and 500 musketeers . The second line , which included Rupert 's Regiment of Horse but also some comparatively inexperienced regiments , was commanded by Lord Molyneux , although the experienced but unprincipled Sir John Urry ( or \" Hurry \" ) was Sergeant Major General of Rupert 's horse and therefore Byron 's second in command . Unlike the Covenanters and Parliamentarians , Rupert retained a reserve of 600 cavalry , including his elite Lifeguard of Horse , under his personal command . This reserve was situated behind the centre . = = = Main action = = = Delayed by the late arrival of the York garrison , it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed . A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day . From the ranks of the allied army he could hear the singing of psalms . As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper , Leven noted the lack of preparation among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7 : 30 pm , just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor . On the allied left , Crawford 's infantry outflanked and drove back Napier 's brigade while Cromwell 's horse quickly defeated Byron 's wing . Though Byron had been ordered to stand his ground and rely on the ditch and musket fire to slow and disorganize an enemy attack , he instead ordered a hasty counter-charge which disordered his own troops and prevented his musketeers and four \" drakes \" ( field guns ) attached to Napier 's brigade from firing for fear of hitting their own cavalry . In the clashes which followed , Byron 's front line regiments were put to flight . Cromwell was slightly wounded in the neck , by a pistol ball in most accounts , and briefly left the field to have the wound dressed . Noting the setback on this flank , Rupert led his reserve towards the right , rallying his own fleeing regiment of horse and leading them in a counter-attack . A Parliamentarian officer wrote : Cromwell 's own division had a hard pull of it ; for they were charged by Rupert 's bravest men both in front and flank ; they stood at the sword 's point a pretty while , hacking one another ; but at last ( it so pleased God ) he [ Cromwell ] brake through them , scattering them before him like a little dust . Leslie 's Covenanter regiments eventually swung the balance for Cromwell , outflanking and defeating the Royalist cavalry . Rupert 's right wing and reserve were routed and he himself narrowly avoided capture by hiding in a nearby bean field . In the centre , the main Covenanter foot initially succeeded in crossing the ditch , capturing at least three pieces of artillery . On the allied right , Sir Thomas Fairfax 's wing fared worse . He later wrote : Our Right Wing had not , all , so good success , by reason of the whins and ditches which we were to pass over before we could get to the Enemy , which put us into great disorder : notwithstanding , I drew up a body of 400 Horse . But because the intervals of Horse , in this Wing only , were lined with Musketeers ; which did us much hurt with their shot ; I was necessitated to charge them . We were a long time engaged with one another , but at last we routed that part of their Wing ... [ I ] myself only returned presently , to get to the men I left behind me . But that part of the Enemy which stood , perceiving the disorder they were in , had charged and routed them , before I could get to them . Fairfax wrote that his second-in-command , Major-General Lambert , could not get up to him , and so charged in another place . A lane , the present-day Atterwith Lane , crossed the ditch on this flank , and some accounts suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast . When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s , several hundred musket balls were recovered . When Goring launched a counter-charge , the disorganised Parliamentarians were routed , although some of the Covenanter cavalry regiments with Sir Thomas Fairfax 's wing , especially the Earl of Eglinton 's regiment , resisted stoutly for some time . As an eyewitness observed : sir Tho . Fairfax his new levied Regiments being in the Van [ of the right wing ] , they wheeled about , & being hotly pursued by the enemy , came back upon the L. Fairfax foot , and the reserve of the Scottish foot , broke them wholly , & trod the most part of them under foot . Most of Goring 's victorious wing then either scattered in pursuit , or fell out to loot the allied baggage train , but some of them under Lucas wheeled to attack the right flank of the allied infantry . Meanwhile , some of Newcastle 's foot counter-attacked the brigade of Fairfax 's foot in the centre of the allied front line and threw them into confusion . Following up this advantage , Blakiston 's brigade of horse , probably reinforced by the troop of \" gentleman volunteers \" under Newcastle himself , charged the allied centre . Under Lucas 's and Blakiston 's assaults in the confusion and the gathering darkness , six of the Covenanter infantry regiments and all of Fairfax 's infantry fled the field . The Scottish sergeant major general , Lumsden , on the right of the allied second line , stated that : These that ran away shew themselves most baselie . I commanding the battel was on the head of your Lordships [ Loudoun 's ] Regiment , and Buccleuch 's ; but they carried themselves not so I could have wished , neither could I prevaile with them : For these that fled , never came to charge with the enemie , but were so possest with ane pannick fear , that they ran for an example to others , and no enemie following them , which gave the enemie [ an opportunity ] to charge them , they intended not , & they had only the losse . One isolated Covenanter brigade that stood its ground was at the right of their front line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland . Lucas launched three cavalry charges against them . In the third charge , Lucas 's horse was killed , and he was taken prisoner . Behind them , Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre , pushing four regiments ( those of the Earl of Cassilis , William Douglas of Kilhead , Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline ) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment forward into the breach in the allied front line . Behind them in turn , the Earl of Manchester 's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston 's brigade . By now it was nearly fully dark , although the full moon was rising . The countryside for miles around was covered with fugitives from both sides . A messenger from Ireland riding in search of Prince Rupert wrote : In this horrible distraction did I coast the country ; here meeting with a shoal of Scots crying out , ' Weys us , we are all undone ' ; and so full of lamentation and mourning , as if their day of doom had overtaken them , and from which they knew not whither to fly ; and anon I met with a ragged troop reduced to four and a Cornet ; by and by with a little foot officer without hat , band , sword , or indeed anything but feet and so much tongue as would serve to enquire the way to the next garrisons , which ( to say the truth ) were well filled with the stragglers on both sides within a few hours , though they lay distant from the place of the fight 20 or 30 miles . Cromwell 's disciplined horsemen had rallied behind the right of the original Royalist position . Sir Thomas Fairfax , finding himself alone in the midst of Goring 's men , removed the \" field sign \" ( a handkerchief or slip of white paper which identified him as a Parliamentarian ) from his hat , and made his way to Cromwell 's wing to relate the state of affairs on the allied right flank . Some five or six troops of Fairfax 's cavalry and Balgonie 's Covenanter regiment of horse ( split into two bodies ) also made their way though the Royalists to join Cromwell . Cromwell now led his cavalry , with Sir David Leslie still in support and Sergeant Major General Crawford 's foot on his right flank , across the battlefield to attack Goring 's cavalry . By this time , Goring 's troops were tired and disorganised , and several of his senior officers were prisoners . They nevertheless marched down the hill from the Parliamentarian baggage to occupy roughly the same position which Fairfax 's cavalry had held at the start of the battle , which most contemporary accounts stated to be a disadvantageous position . When Cromwell attacked , Goring 's outnumbered troops were driven back . Many of them retired to the \" glen \" , the fold of ground beneath Marston Hill , but refused to take any further part in the battle despite the efforts of officers such as Sir Marmaduke Langdale and Sir Philip Monckton to rally them . Eventually they obeyed orders to retreat to York late at night . The triumphant allies meanwhile turned against the remains of the Royalist centre , overrunning successive units and cutting down many fugitives . Finally some of Newcastle 's foot , the \" whitecoats \" , gathered for a last stand in a ditched enclosure . This has usually been stated to be White Sike Close , in the rear of the Royalists ' original position , where some of Newcastle 's infantry would have retreated when they found their right flank \" in the air \" following the defeat of Byron 's and Rupert 's cavalry , and certainly where some mass burials later took place , although the enclosure may instead have been Fox Covert , a mile north of Long Marston on the natural line of retreat towards York . The whitecoats refused quarter and repulsed constant cavalry charges until infantry and Colonel Hugh Fraser 's dragoons were brought up to break their formation with musket fire . The last 30 survivors finally surrendered . = = = Casualties = = = Approximately 4,000 Royalist soldiers had been killed , many in the last stand of the whitecoats , and 1,500 captured , including Lucas and Tillier . The Royalists lost all their guns , with many hundreds of weapons and several standards also falling into the hands of the allied forces . The allied generals ' dispatch , and other Parliamentarian accounts , stated that 300 of their soldiers were killed . One of those mortally wounded among the Parliamentarians was Sir Thomas Fairfax 's brother , Charles . Another was Cromwell 's nephew , Valentine Walton , who was struck by a cannonball early in the day . Cromwell was present when he died afterwards , and wrote a famous letter to the soldier 's father , Cromwell 's brother-in-law , also named Valentine Walton , which briefly described the battle and then informed the father of the son 's last words and death . = = Outcome = = = = = Royalists = = = Late at night , the Royalist generals reached York , with many routed troops and stragglers . The Governor of York , Sir Thomas Glemham , allowed only those who were part of the garrison ( in effect , only a few officers who had participated in the battle as volunteers ) into the city , in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered the city on the heels of the fleeing Royalists . Many fugitives , including wounded , crowded the streets before Micklegate Bar , the western gate into the city . Newcastle , having seen his forces broken and having spent his entire fortune in the Royalist cause , resolved that he would not endure the \" laughter of the court \" . He departed for Scarborough on the day after the battle ( 3 July ) and went into exile in Hamburg , with Eythin and many of his senior officers . Two days after the battle , Rupert rallied 5,000 cavalry and a few hundred infantry whom he mounted on spare horses . He considered that rather than attempt to restore Royalist fortunes in the north , he was required to return south to rejoin the King . Leaving York by way of Monk Bar on the north east side , he marched back over the Pennines , making a detour to Richmond to escape interception . At Marston Moor , Rupert had been decisively beaten for the first time in the war . He was deeply affected by the defeat , and kept the King 's ambiguous dispatch close to him for the remainder of his life . He had suffered an additional blow through the death during the battle of his dog \" Boye \" , who had been a constant companion by his side throughout his campaigns . Parliamentarian propaganda made much of this , treating Boye almost as a Devil 's familiar . With the departure of Newcastle and Rupert , the Royalists effectively abandoned the north , except for isolated garrisons , which were reduced one by one over the next few months . The remnants of Byron 's troops were driven from Lancashire in August , and were involved in another Royalist disaster at the Relief of Montgomery Castle in Wales in September . The Royalist cavalry from the northern counties , the \" Northern Horse \" , continued to fight for Charles under Sir Marmaduke Langdale . They relieved a Royalist garrison at Pontefract Castle in south Yorkshire in February 1645 , but their undisciplined and licentious conduct turned many former sympathisers away from the Royalist cause . After being involved in the defeats of Charles at the battles of Naseby and Rowton Heath , they made a final attempt to reach Scotland and were routed at Sherburn-in-Elmet in October 1645 . = = = Allies = = = The victorious allies regrouped , although too slowly to intercept Rupert as he left York . Once the allied army had reformed ( and had been joined by Meldrum 's and Denbigh 's forces ) they resumed the siege of York . Without hope of relief , and under the agreement that no Scottish soldiers were to be quartered in the city , the garrison surrendered on honourable terms on 16 July . Once York surrendered , the allied army soon dispersed . Leven took his troops north to besiege Newcastle upon Tyne and Carlisle . He sent dispatches to Scotland ordering that all runaways from the Covenanter regiments which broke at Marston Moor be returned , but not before every tenth deserter was hanged according to article 14 of Leven 's Articles of War . Once reunited with the Army of both Kingdoms , the remnants of the six broken regiments were put to base service such as latrine duties and the disposing of corpses until they got the chance to redeem themselves during the storm of Newcastle . Manchester 's army returned to Lincolnshire and eventually moved into the south of England to take part in the Second Battle of Newbury . The Earl of Leven had again demonstrated the importance of disciplined infantry . Even as some of the newly levied allied regiments were routed by the Royalists , he had ensured he had enough veterans in reserve to replace them and overturn the early gains made by his opponents . Cromwell 's reputation as a cavalry commander was also firmly established at this battle . Despite attempts by his political rivals such as Denzil Holles and military critics such as Major General Lawrence Crawford to belittle the part he played , it was acknowledged that the discipline he had instilled into his troops and his own leadership on the battlefield had been crucial to the victory . Cromwell would later declare that Marston Moor was \" an absolute victory obtained by God 's blessing \" . From this moment , he was to exert increasing influence both in the House of Commons and in the Parliamentarian armies in the field . However , the accounts published after the battle exacerbated the rifts which were already growing between the moderates and Presbyterians on the one hand and the Independents on the other . The noted Scottish theologian Robert Baillie wrote from Westminster only a few days later to one of his Independent brethren : We were both grieved and angry , that your Independents there should have sent up Major Harrison to trumpet over all the city their own praises , to our prejudice , making all believe , that Cromwell alone , with his unspeakable valorous regiments , had done all that service : that most of us fled : and who stayed they fought so and so , as it might be . We were much vexed with these reports , against which yow were not pleased , any of yow to instruct us with any ansuer , till Lindesay 's letters came at last , and captain Stewart with his collors . Then we sent abroad our printed relations , and could lift up our face . But within three days Mr Ashe 's relation was also printed , who gives us many good words , but gives much more to Cromwell than we are informed is his due \u2026 See by this inclosed , if the whole victorie both in the right and left wing , be not ascribed to Cromwell , and not a word of David Lesley , who in all places that day was his leader . = = = = Conduct of the allied generals = = = = Much of the resulting many-sided dispute among the Parliamentarians and Covenanters was prompted by accounts very soon after the battle that all three allied generals-in-chief had fled the field . The Earl of Manchester left the field but he subsequently rallied some infantry and returned , although he was able to exercise little control over events . By some accounts , Lord Fairfax and Leven also fled the battlefield with their routed troops , but this has recently been challenged , certainly in Leven 's case . The most detailed account of Leven 's flight was written by the biographer of Lieutenant Colonel James Somerville , who was present at the battle as a volunteer . However , this second hand account was published only in 1679 , and has been challenged by previously unused eye witness accounts . These show most of the Covenanter infantry and cavalry units remained fighting until the end of the battle . As seven different eyewitnesses attested , they did so under the direction of Leven . For example , Simeon Ashe ( the Earl of Manchester 's chaplain ) noted that : The Earl of Manchester \u2019 s new levied Forces began to give backe , the Enemey pursued our men , fell on again and gained two peeces of ordnance there ; Rupert fell upon Sir Thomas Fairfaxes horse , and there was a very hot fight , many slayne on both sides : our forces retreated , but ralleing our men again and General Lessly coming on with his foot , they fell on furiously , many were killed on both sides , and then the enemy beginning to retreat , our men followed pursuing and totally Routed Rupert . The enigmatic English reporter , \" T. M. \" , agreed that Leven still commanded the centre battalia after the initial rout : The Lord of Hosts did so strike up the hearts of the three Noble Generals [ that God ] took boldness and courage unto them , gathering up those Horse Forces that were left into a body to assist those English and Scotts that stood to it , and set upon them , as David with his small Army upon the numerous company of the Amalekites , while they were rejoicing over their spoils , and smote them until the evening . = = Fiction and media = = In 1971 the British band Electric Light Orchestra released a song titled \" The Battle of Marston Moor ( July 2nd 1644 ) \" .",

                    "text": "Attack on German Flatts ( 1778 ) = The Attack on German Flatts ( September 17 , 1778 ) was a raid on the frontier settlement of German Flatts , New York ( which then also encompassed what is now Herkimer ) during the American Revolutionary War . The attack was made by a mixed force of Loyalists and Iroquois under the overall command of Mohawk leader Joseph Brant , and resulted in the destruction of houses , barns , and crops , and the taking of livestock for the raiders ' use . The settlers , warned by the heroic run of Adam Helmer , took refuge in local forts but were too militarily weak to stop the raiders . Brant 's attack was one of a series executed under his command or that of Loyalist and Seneca leaders against communities on what was then the frontier of western New York and northern Pennsylvania . New York authorities responded by ordering an expedition that destroyed Brant 's forward operating bases in Iroquois territory . = = Background = = With the failure of British General John Burgoyne 's campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 , the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war . British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments . During the winter of 1777 \u2013 78 Brant and other British-allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania . In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga ( present-day Windsor , New York ) . He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in late May . One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler , who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley . His first expedition was a raid on Cobleskill , and he raided other frontier communities throughout the summer . When he raided settlements at Springfield and Andrustown ( present-day Jordanville ) in July , Brant left the survivors with warnings that German Flatts would soon also be attacked . The settlement of German Flatts ( now known as Herkimer due to a survey error in 1788 that reversed the names of Herkimer and what is now German Flatts on the south bank of the Mohawk River ) was founded in 1723 by Palatine German immigrants . The district was defended by a local militia regiment under the command of Colonel Peter Bellinger . There were two main forts , Fort Dayton and Fort Herkimer , on either side of the Mohawk . = = Prelude = = Although Brant had planned on raiding German Flatts sooner than September , the absence of John Butler delayed his plans . Butler had returned to Fort Niagara after his attack on the Wyoming Valley communities in July , sending Captain William Caldwell to Unaquaga to recruit men for the unit known as Butler 's Rangers . By early September it was clear that Butler was not returning to the area , so Brant and Caldwell launched the expedition with the men they had . The exact composition of the force that left Unadilla is unclear . Sources generally agree that 152 Iroquois , principally Mohawk , were in the force , but that the Loyalists ( in either Caldwell 's Ranger company or in Brant 's company of volunteers ) numbered between 200 and 300 . Because of warnings received earlier that Brant was planning an attack , Colonel Bellinger had been sending out scouts in the direction of Unadilla to gather intelligence . On September 16 Brant 's company overwhelmed a scouting party of nine , killing a few and scattering the rest . One of the survivors was Adam Helmer , who ran 26 miles ( 42 km ) ahead of the advancing force to warn German Flatts . Colonel Bellinger sounded the call to arms of his regiment and sent an urgent request to Colonel Jacob Klock for the assistance of his regiment , while the settlers took refuge in the forts . = = Raid = = Caldwell , Brant , and their men arrived at German Flatts not long after Helmer 's warning , on the evening of September 16 , and began their attack the next morning . Because the settlers had taken refuge in the forts , there was no significant opportunity for the raiders to take prisoners or scalps . They demonstrated before the forts , but lacked heavy weapons with which to properly assault them . They instead rampaged through the communities on both sides of the Mohawk , destroying 63 homes , a similar number of barns , three grist mills , and one saw mill . They drove off a large number of horses , cattle , and sheep , killing those they could not take with them . The only buildings left standing were the forts , a barn , the church , and the homes of the minister and a few Loyalists . More than 700 people were made homeless by their destruction . Because of Helmer 's warning only three Americans were killed . Captain Caldwell wrote that his men \" would have in all probability killed most of the inhabitants of German Flatts had they not been apprised of our coming by one of the scouts getting in and warning of our approach , and perhaps got to their forts \" . = = Aftermath = = Klock 's regiment did not arrive until after the raiders had left . The militia pursued the raiders , but were unable to catch up with them . Some friendly Oneidas and Tuscaroras , however , capitalized on Brant 's absence from Unadilla to raid that town , freeing prisoners that Brant had taken while en route to German Flatts . The Americans launched retaliatory raids in early October that destroyed Unadilla and Onaquaga . Brant and John Butler 's son Walter organized a retaliatory expedition against Cherry Valley , which was the scene of a massacre in November . This action and others by Brant and Butler contributed to the decision by the Continental Congress to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory . Commanded by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton , the 1779 expedition systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British , but did little to stop the frontier war . The German Flatts area in particular was the subject of repeated raids . Walter D. Edmonds ' 1936 novel Drums Along the Mohawk recounts the story of Adam Helmer 's run and gives an overview of the German settlements along the river . It was adapted as a film by the same name , directed by John Ford and released in 1939 .",

                    "text": "Siege of Savage 's Old Fields = The Siege of Savage 's Old Fields ( also known as the First Siege of Ninety Six , November 19 \u2013 21 , 1775 ) was an encounter between Patriot and Loyalist forces in the back country town of Ninety Six , South Carolina , early in the American Revolutionary War . It was the first major conflict in South Carolina in the war , having been preceded by bloodless seizures of several military fortifications in the province . Patriot forces under the command of Major Andrew Williamson had been dispatched to the area to recover a shipment of gunpowder and ammunition intended for the Cherokees that had been seized by Loyalists . Williamson 's force , numbering over 500 , established a stockaded fort near Ninety Six , where it was surrounded by some 1,900 Loyalists . Because the war was in its early days and the partisan war in the southern back country had not become as brutal as it would be later in the war , the siege was conducted desultorily , and was effectively a stalemate . After two days the Loyalists withdrew , having lost four killed and 20 wounded to one Patriot killed and 12 wounded . The Patriots also withdrew toward the coast , but a major Patriot expedition not long after resulted in the arrest or flight of most of the Loyalist leadership . = = Background = = When the American Revolutionary War began in Massachusetts in April 1775 , the free population of the Province of South Carolina was divided in its reaction . Many English coastal residents were either neutral or favored the rebellion , while significant numbers of back country residents , many of whom were German and Scottish immigrants , were opposed . Loyalist sentiment in the back country was dominated by Thomas Fletchall , a vocal and active opponent of Patriot attempts to resist King and Parliament . By August 1775 tensions between Patriot and Loyalist in the province had escalated to the point where both sides had raised sizable militia forces . Events were largely nonviolent for some time , although there were isolated instances of tarring and feathering , but tensions were high as the sides struggled for control of munitions . The Council of Safety in early August sent William Henry Drayton and Reverend William Tennent to Ninety Six to rally Patriot support and suppress growing Loyalist support in the back country . Drayton was able to negotiate a tenuous truce with Fletchall in September . On September 15 , Patriot militia seized Fort Johnson , the principal fortification overlooking the Charleston harbor . Governor William Campbell dissolved the provincial assembly , and fearing for his personal safety , fled to the Royal Navy sloop of war HMS Tamar . This left the Patriot Council of Safety in control of the provincial capital . The council began improving and expanding Charleston 's coastal defenses ; eventually this culminated in a bloodless exchange of cannon fire between Patriot positions and Royal Navy ships in the harbor on November 11 and 12 . Matters also escalated after the seizure by Loyalists in October of a shipment of gunpowder and ammunition sent by the Council of Safety and intended for the Cherokee . The council responded by organizing a large-scale expedition to recover the munitions . On November 8 it voted to send Colonel Richard Richardson , the commander of the Camden militia , to recover the shipment and arrest Loyalist leaders . = = Siege = = While Richardson gathered his forces , Major Andrew Williamson , who had already been recruiting in the back country , learned of the gunpowder seizure . He arrived at Ninety Six early on November 19 with 560 men . Finding the small town to be not very defensible , he established a camp on John Savage 's plantation , provided a field of fire for the force 's three swivel guns . He began fortifying the camp , ordering the construction of an improvised stockade . Loyalist recruiting had been more successful : Williamson had learned that Captain Patrick Cuningham and Major Joseph Robinson were leading a large Loyalist force ( estimated to number about 1,900 ) toward Ninety Six . In a war council that day , the Patriot leaders decided against marching out to face the Loyalists . The Loyalists arrived the next day , and surrounded the Patriot camp . The leaders of the two factions were in the midst of negotiating an end to the standoff when two Patriot militiamen were seized by Loyalists outside the stockade . This set off a gunfight that lasted for about two hours . The next morning the two sides resumed firing at each other at long range . The Loyalists attempted to set fires , creating a smokescreen they could use to approach the stockade . This attempt was frustrated by the wet ground . The Loyalists next constructed a large wooden shield behind which they sought to bring incendiaries closer to the fort , but they only succeeded in \" [ setting ] Fire to their own Engine themselves \" , according to one account , and it was not proof against the Patriot 's guns . On the afternoon of November 21 the Patriots held a war council , in which they decided to sortie that night . They were preparing for this action at sunset when a Loyalist approached with a parley flag . Nothing was decided in the discussion beyond an agreement to meet the next morning . In that meeting , the Loyalists agreed to withdraw across the Saluda River and the Patriots agreed to destroy the fort . Both sides were to return prisoners taken since November 2 and not interfere with each other 's communications with their respective political leaders . The Patriot leaders were also required to surrender their swivel guns , although they were returned three days later . The truce also included reinforcements for both sides , terms that the Council of Safety claimed did not apply to Colonel Richardson 's force . = = Aftermath = = The reasons why the Loyalists chose to negotiate the truce are unknown . Governor Campbell described the Loyalists as lacking in effective leadership , and historian Martin Cann speculates that it may have been caused by Colonel Richardson 's preparations or approach . Richardson mobilized 2,500 men , which grew by the end of November to more than 4,000 . This force scoured the back country , arresting or driving away most of the Loyalist leadership . The campaign effectively ended on December 22 , when 15 inches ( 38 cm ) of snow fell on the area . Richardson 's men , unprepared for the snow , made a difficult trek back to the lowlands . Some of the Loyalist leaders who escaped Richardson 's expedition , including most notably Thomas Brown , fled to West Florida where they joined regular and irregular forces serving with the British . These events resulted in the end of large-scale Loyalist activity in the southern Appalachians , although what was in many ways a civil war became progressively more brutal in the following years . Ninety Six became a British outpost after the 1780 Siege of Charleston , and was besieged in 1781 by forces under the command of Nathanael Greene . Although Greene was forced to lift that siege by the approach of a relief force , the British abandoned Ninety Six not long afterward .",

                    "text": "Battle of Harlem Heights = The Battle of Harlem Heights was fought during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War . The action took place in what is now the Morningside Heights and east into the future Harlem neighborhoods of northwestern Manhattan Island in what is now New York City on September 16 , 1776 . The Continental Army , under Commander-in-Chief General George Washington , Major General Nathanael Greene , and Major General Israel Putnam , totaling around 9,000 men , held a series of high ground positions in upper Manhattan . Immediately opposite was the vanguard of the British Army totaling around 5,000 men under the command of Major General Henry Clinton . An early morning skirmish between a patrol of Knowlton 's Rangers and British light infantry piquets developed into a running fight as the British pursued the Americans back through woods towards Washington 's position on Harlem Heights . The overconfident British light troops , having advanced too far from their lines without support , had exposed themselves to counter-attack . Washington , seeing this , ordered a flanking manouevre which failed to cut off the British force but , combined with pressure from troops arriving from the Harlem Heights position , succeeded in driving them back . Meeting reinforcements coming from the south with artillery support , the British light infantry turned and made a stand in open fields on Morningside Heights . The Americans , also reinforced , came on in strength and there followed a lengthy exchange of fire . After two hours , with ammunition running short , the British force began to pull back to their lines . Washington cut short the pursuit , unwilling to risk a general engagement with the British main force , and withdrew to his own lines . The battle helped restore the confidence of the Continental Army after suffering several defeats . It was Washington 's first battlefield success of the war . After a month without any major fighting between the armies , Washington was forced to withdraw his army north to the town of White Plains in southeastern New York when the British moved north into Westchester County and threatened to trap Washington further south on Manhattan . Washington suffered two more defeats , at White Plains and Fort Washington . After these two defeats , and also with the evacuation of Fort Lee ( named after his deputy , General Charles Lee ) across the Hudson River guarding the western shore in New Jersey , Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania . The New York and New Jersey campaign ended after the subsequent American Christmas victories at Trenton and Princeton , which reinvigorated the Continental Army and the new nation . = = Background = = On August 27 , 1776 , British troops under the command of General William Howe flanked and defeated the American army at the Battle of Long Island . Howe moved his forces and pinned the Americans down at Brooklyn Heights , with the East River to the American rear . On the night of August 29 , General George Washington , Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army , evacuated his entire army of 9,000 men and their equipment across the water to Manhattan . On September 15 , Howe landed his army in an amphibious operation at Kip 's Bay , on the eastern shore of Manhattan , along the East River . After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore , 4,000 British and Hessian troops landed at Battle of Kip 's Bay . The American troops began to flee at the sight of the enemy , and even with Washington 's arrival on the scene and taking immediate bold command , demanding his soldiers to fight , they refused to obey orders and continued to flee . After scattering the Americans at Kip 's Bay , Howe landed 9,000 more troops , but did not immediately cut off the American retreat from New York Town in the south of the island . Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the westside of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4 : 00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall . = = Battle = = Early on September 16 , Washington received reports , which proved to be unfounded , that the British were advancing . Washington , who had been expecting an attack , had ordered a party of 150 men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton to reconnoiter the British lines . At daybreak , Knowlton 's troops were spotted by the pickets of the British light infantry . The British sent two or three companies to attack the enemy to their front . For more than half an hour the skirmish continued , with fighting in the woods between two farms . When Knowlton realized that the numerically superior British forces were trying to turn his flank , he ordered a retreat , which was conducted \" without confusion or loss \" , although perhaps ten men had been lost in the initial skirmish . The British followed in rapid pursuit . As they advanced , the British light troops signalled with bugle calls , which to Colonel Joseph Reed were reminiscent of a fox hunt , and seemed to him to be intended as an insult . Probably about this time , the Second and Third battalions of British light infantry , along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements . Reed , who had met Knowlton , rode to Washington to tell him what was going on and encouraged him to reinforce the rangers . Instead of retreating , Washington , in what Edward G. Lengel calls \" an early glimmer of the courage and resolve that would rally the Continentals from many a tight spot later on \" , devised a plan to entrap the British light troops . Washington would have some troops make a feint , in order to draw the British down into a an area of open ground known as ' The Hollow Way ' , and then send a detachment of troops around to trap the British . The feint party was composed of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British . After the British were in the hollow way , the 150 volunteers were reinforced by 900 more men . All of the troops were stationed too far away from one another to do much damage . The flanking party consisted of Knowlton 's Rangers , which had been reinforced by three companies of riflemen , in total about 200 men . As they approached , an officer accidentally misdirected the men , and the firing broke out on the British flank , not their rear . The British troops , realizing that they had almost been surrounded , retreated to a field , where there was a fence . The Americans soon pursued and , during the attack , Knowlton was killed . Despite this , the American troops pushed on ; driving the British troops beyond the fence to the top of a hill . When they reached the hill , the British forces received reinforcements ; including some artillery . For two hours , the British troops held their ground at the top of the hill until the Americans once again forced them to retreat , into a buckwheat field . Washington was originally reluctant to pursue the British troops , but after seeing that his men were slowly pushing the British back , he sent in reinforcements and permitted the troops to engage in a direct attack . By the time that all of the reinforcements arrived , nearly 1,800 Americans were engaged in the buckwheat field . To direct the battle , members of Washington 's staff , including Nathanael Greene , were sent in . By this time , the British troops had also been reinforced ; bringing their strength up to about 5,000 men . For an hour-and-a-half , the battle continued in the field and in the surrounding hills until , \" having fired away their ammunition \" , the British withdrew . The Americans kept up a close pursuit until it was heard that British reserves were coming , and Washington , fearing a British trap , ordered a withdrawal . Upon hearing Washington 's orders to withdraw , the troops gave a loud \" huzzah \" and left the field in good order . = = Aftermath = = The British casualties were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded . However , a member of Howe 's staff wrote in his diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded . David McCullough gives much higher figures of 90 killed and 300 wounded . The Americans had about 30 killed and 100 wounded , including among the dead , Knowlton and Major Andrew Leitch . The American victory raised morale in the ranks , even among those who had not been engaged . It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington 's command . There was little fighting for the next month of the campaign , but Washington moved his army to White Plains in October after hearing that the British were attempting to trap him on Manhattan . After being defeated at the Battle of White Plains and later at Fort Washington , Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey , pursued by the British , into Pennsylvania . The loss of Knowlton was a blow to the fledgling American intelligence operations , as he had created and led the first such unit of the Continental Army , at the direction of Washington .",

                    "text": "Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery = The Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery was an American Revolutionary War battle fought in the highlands of the Hudson River valley , not far from West Point , on October 6 , 1777 . British forces under the command of General Sir Henry Clinton captured Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery , and then dismantled the Hudson River Chain . The purpose of the attack was to create a diversion to draw American troops from the army of General Horatio Gates , whose army was opposing British General John Burgoyne 's attempt to gain control of the Hudson . The forts were garrisoned by about 600 Continental Army troops under the command of two brothers , General ( and Governor of New York ) George Clinton , and General James Clinton , while General Israel Putnam led additional troops at nearby Peekskill , New York . ( This battle is also sometimes called the \" battle of the Clintons \" due to the number of participants with that name . The brothers were probably not related to Sir Henry . ) Using a series of feints , Henry Clinton fooled Putnam into withdrawing most of his troops to the east , and then he landed over 2,000 troops on the west side of the Hudson to assault the two forts . After several hours of hiking through the hilly terrain , Clinton divided his troops to stage simultaneous assaults on the two forts . Although the approach to Fort Montgomery was contested by a company armed with a small field piece , they attacked the two forts at nearly the same time and captured them after a relatively short battle . More than half the defenders were killed , wounded , or captured . The British followed up this success with raids as far north as Kingston before being recalled to New York City . The action came too late to be of any assistance to Burgoyne , who surrendered his army on October 17 . The only notable consequences of the action were the casualties suffered and the British destruction of the two forts on their departure . = = Background = = The Hudson River valley was a strategically critical area throughout the American Revolutionary War . Through this area moved supplies , men and materials between the New England states and those further south , something that became even more vitally important when the British largely abandoned New England as an objective of military control later in the war . In June 1777 , General John Burgoyne began an attempt to gain control of this key area by moving south from the British province of Quebec . After his early success at Ticonderoga , his campaign become bogged down in logistical difficulties , not reaching Saratoga , New York until mid-September . Burgoyne held expectations that his campaign would be supported by military forces based in New York City under the command of General William Howe , and that the forces would meet at Albany , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) south of Saratoga . Apparently as result of poor communications with Lord Germain , Britain 's Secretary of State for the Colonies and the political official in charge of the conflict , General Howe decided instead to attempt the capture of Philadelphia , and sailed south with much of his army in July , leaving Sir Henry Clinton in command at New York . Howe 's instructions to General Clinton were primarily to hold New York City , and to only engage in offensive operations that were consistent with that goal . His instructions to Clinton on July 30 included a promise that reinforcements would arrive ( but without any promised time ) , and that Clinton should consider making a move \" in favor or General Burgoyne 's approaching Albany , with security to Kingsbridge \" if the opportunity presented itself . A letter from Howe reached Burgoyne on August 3 informing him of his move to Philadelphia , and of Clinton 's instructions . Clinton wrote a letter on September 12 ( received by Burgoyne on the 21st , after the Battle of Freeman 's Farm ) that he would \" make a push at [ Fort ] Montgomery in about ten days \" if \" you think 2000 men can assist you effectually \" . = = Prelude = = = = = American defenses = = = The highland region of the Hudson River valley ( near West Point ) was defended by Continental Army troops and state militia under the command of Major General Israel Putnam , who was based at Peekskill . Several miles upriver from Peekskill , just above the Popolopen Gorge where Popolopen Creek enters the Hudson , the Americans had placed a chain across the Hudson to prevent British naval vessels from sailing further upriver . The chain 's western end was guarded by Fort Montgomery ( named for the late General Richard Montgomery ) , which also overlooked the gorge to the south . Also on the west side of the river , south of the gorge , they had established Fort Clinton ( probably named for General James Clinton ) . Fort Montgomery , which was still undergoing construction , was under the command of General ( and Governor of New York ) George Clinton , while Fort Clinton was under the command of his older brother James . Their combined forces numbered about 600 . The primary camp at Peekskill , which any British naval movements would need to pass , had roughly 600 men . Of the men at the three sites , about 1,000 were regular troops , while the remainder were short-term New York militia . Putnam 's forces had originally been larger , but General Washington had ordered some of Putnam 's troops to assist either his ( Washington 's ) defense against Howe or Gates ' defense against Burgoyne , and a number of local militia companies had been dismissed when Howe 's movements became known . Putnam received word of the arrival of transports in New York on September 29 , and wrote Governor Clinton for assistance , who immediately came south from Kingston to take charge of the forts . = = = British movements = = = In mid-September ( around the time he wrote the letter to Burgoyne ) , Sir Henry Clinton had around 7,000 men , including around 3,000 poorly trained Loyalists , to defend New York City . His letter to Burgoyne had been predicated on the expectation that the expected reinforcements would arrive in time for him to make a move up the Hudson within ten days . On September 29 , he received a letter from Burgoyne ( written after Freeman 's Farm ) in response to his that was a direct plea for action . By the end of September , 1,700 additional troops were landed from the fleet arriving at New York . On October 3 , Sir Henry started up the Hudson River with 3,000 men in three frigates and a number of smaller vessels . The next day , he landed some troops near Tarrytown as a feint to draw Putnam 's troops from Peekskill . These troops marched about and then reboarded the ships , which continued north . He then made a similar feinting maneuver at Verplanck 's Point , just three miles ( 4.8 km ) south of Peekskill on October 5 , where he dislodged a poorly manned American outpost . These feinting maneuvers completely fooled Putnam , who drew his troops back into the eastern highlands and sent messages across the Hudson for reinforcements . Shortly before this last movement , Sir Henry received a dispatch from Burgoyne . In it , Burgoyne explicitly appeals to Clinton for instruction on whether he should attempt to advance or retreat , based on the likelihood of Clinton 's arrival at Albany for support . He indicated that if he did not receive a response by October 12 , he would be forced to retreat . ( Clinton 's response , not written until October 7 , was a markedly formal response , indicating that he was providing the requested diversion , and had no expectation of reaching Albany , adding that \" Sir Henry Clinton cannot presume to give any Orders to General Burgoyne \" , as Burgoyne outranked him . Fortunately for Clinton none of the three copies of this letter reached Burgoyne ; all of the messengers carrying them were captured . ) = = Battle = = On the foggy morning of October 6 , Sir Henry Clinton landed 2,100 men at Stony Point on the west side of the Hudson and , with the assistance of a Loyalist guide , marched them up onto a local rise called the \" Timp \" . After descending the other side to a place called Doodletown , they encountered a scouting party that Governor Clinton had sent out for reconnaissance , which retreated toward Fort Clinton after a brief exchange of fire . Sir Henry then divided his force into two attack groups to take the forts . A force of about 900 men under Lieutenant Colonel Campbell , composed of the 52nd and 57th regiments , a detachment of Hessian chasseurs , and about 400 Loyalists led by Beverley Robinson , began the 7 miles ( 11 km ) trek around the gorge toward Fort Montgomery , while Sir Henry waited with the remaining 1,200 men at Doodletown before starting on the trail to Fort Clinton in order to give Campbell time to make the longer journey before beginning simultaneous attacks on the two forts . Governor Clinton , when alerted to the first skirmish , had immediately sent to Putnam for reinforcements . Shortly after sending that message he learned from scouts that Sir Henry 's forces were divided . While waiting for reinforcements ( that never came because of Sir Henry 's successful feints ) his brother James sent 100 men from Fort Clinton toward Doodletown , while he sent another company from Fort Montgomery to oppose Campbell 's force . = = = Fort Montgomery = = = The detachment from Fort Montgomery numbered about 100 men , and included a small artillery piece commanded by Captain John Lamb . Setting up a defensive position about one mile ( 1.6 km ) from the fort , they engaged Campbell 's tired forces with spirit . While they were eventually forced to retreat , they were able to spike the field piece before abandoning it to the British . After another stand closer to the fort , supported by 12-pound piece , they again retreated ( again not before spiking the cannon ) . Due to this dogged defense , Campbell was not in position until about one hour before sunset ( having left Doodletown at around 10 am ) . Offered the chance to surrender , Governor Clinton refused , and the battle was joined . Campbell arrayed the Loyalists on the left , the German chasseurs in the center , and the British regiments on the right . Despite vigorous defense and the death of Colonel Campbell , the British forces broke into the fort , where they engaged in a near massacre to avenge the loss of Campbell and other officers . James Clinton narrowly escaped being killed by bayonet when his orderly book deflected the weapon 's point . He and a portion of the fort 's garrison escaped into the woods north of the fort . = = = Fort Clinton = = = The main approach to Fort Clinton was via a narrow strip of land about 400 yards ( 370 m ) wide between a small lake and the river , which , in addition to being covered by the fort 's cannons , Governor Clinton had protected by placing abatis to impeded the British advance . Sir Henry sent the 63rd Foot around the lake to attack the fort from the northwest , while he first sent the light companies of the 7th and 26th regiments and a company of Anspach grenadiers against the main works , followed by the 26th Foot and a detachment from the 17th Light Dragoons , and then the remaining British and German companies . As at Fort Montgomery , the defenders were eventually overwhelmed . Those that surrendered , however , were not subjected to some of the savagery that took place to the north . A number of the garrison , including General Clinton , escaped by scrambling down the embankment to the river , where gunboats took them to safety across the river . = = Aftermath = = = = = Casualties = = = The British casualties were 41 killed and 142 wounded . The Americans had 26 officers and 237 enlisted men captured and about 75 killed and wounded apart from wounded prisoners ; most of them from the garrison of Fort Clinton . The Americans were also forced to destroy a number of boats in the area , as unfavorable winds prevented them from escaping upriver . The next day Sir Henry sent a small detachment to Fort Constitution , a small outpost opposite West Point , and demanded its surrender . The lightly manned garrison at first refused , but it retreated on October 8 in the face of a larger attack force . Governor Clinton and General Putnam strategized on their next move . Clinton opted to move north with troops on the western shore , as a defense against attacks further upriver , while Putnam would take steps to defend against attacks to the east . = = = Further British action = = = Captain James Wallace had begun clearing the river of American-laid obstacles following the battle . By October 13 he was able to report that the river was clear as far north as Esopus . Sir Henry had by then returned to New York due to illness , leaving General John Vaughan in charge at the forts . Due to delays sending transports with reinforcements north , a flotilla carrying Vaughan and 1,700 men did not depart until October 15 , with orders from Clinton to \" proceed up Hudson 's river , to feel for General Burgoyne , to assist his operations \" . They anchored that evening near Esopus . ( It has been speculated that this movement had an effect on the surrender negotiations then ongoing at Saratoga . Due to the slow pace of even horse-based communications , it seems unlikely that General Gates was aware of this movement until after the surrender terms were agreed on October 17 . ) Vaughan 's troops burned Esopus the next day , and then sailed further north , where they raided the Livingston estate , seat of the noted Patriot family . The fleet was pursued by Putnam on the eastern shore . Putnam 's forces , which had grown considerably due to the arrival of militia companies from Connecticut , posed a significant enough threat to Vaughan that he then withdrew back to the boats . On October 17 , Sir Henry received a request for 3,000 men from General Howe ( probably sent after Washington 's failed attack on Germantown ) to support the occupation of Philadelphia . As the New York garrison was the already thinned by the operation on the Hudson , Clinton recalled Vaughan and the garrison holding the two forts . The forts were destroyed and the troops evacuated on October 26 . = = = Legacy = = = The site of Fort Clinton was largely demolished to make way for U.S. Route 9W and the Bear Mountain Bridge , which was completed in 1924 . What remains is preserved within the bounds of Bear Mountain State Park , which also includes the ghost town of Doodletown . Fort Montgomery is a National Historic Landmark , a designation it received in 1972 , when it was also placed on the National Register of Historic Places . It is now located in the Fort Montgomery State Historic Site .",

                    "text": "Meigs Raid = The Meigs Raid ( also known as the Battle of Sag Harbor ) was a military raid by American Continental Army forces , under the command of Connecticut Colonel Return Jonathan Meigs , on a British Loyalist foraging party at Sag Harbor , New York on May 24 , 1777 during the American Revolutionary War . Six Loyalists were killed and 90 captured while the Americans suffered no casualties . The raid was made in response to a successful British raid on Danbury , Connecticut in late April that was opposed by American forces in the Battle of Ridgefield . Organized in New Haven , Connecticut by Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons , the expedition crossed Long Island Sound from Guilford on May 23 , dragged whaleboats across the North Fork of Long Island , and raided Sag Harbor early the next morning , destroying boats and supplies . The battle marked the first American victory in the state of New York after New York City and Long Island had fallen in the British campaign for the city in 1776 . = = Background = = The American Revolutionary War was a qualified success for the British in 1776 . After being forced to abandon Boston , they captured New York City , but were unable to hold New Jersey when General George Washington surprised them at Trenton and Princeton . The British consolidated their hold on New York City and Long Island during the winter months of early 1777 , while the Continental Army established a land blockade around the city in New Jersey , southern New York , and southwestern Connecticut . In the spring of 1777 Lieutenant General William Howe launched raiding expeditions against Continental Army and local militia storage depots near the city . A successful raid against Peekskill , New York in March prompted him to organize a more ambitious expedition to raid a depot in Danbury , Connecticut . This expedition , led by the former royal governor of New York , William Tryon , successfully reached Danbury from a landing point in Fairfield , Connecticut on April 26 , and destroyed provisions and supplies . The Connecticut militia had mobilized , and over the next two days skirmished with the British as they marched back to their ships , most notably on April 27 at Ridgefield . General Samuel Holden Parsons , leading Connecticut 's defenses , decided to organize an act of reprisal . An opportunity arose when they learned that a British foraging expedition had landed at Sag Harbor , Long Island . Sag Harbor had been occupied by British troops after the August 1776 Battle of Long Island , and they had established a strong defensive position on Meeting House Hill , with earthwork fortifications and palisades . The town was well-situated for providing supplies to the Royal Navy , which used Gardiner 's Bay as an anchorage while patrolling the eastern end of Long Island Sound . The forage expedition consisted of 12 smaller boats protected by a schooner mounting 12 guns ; the small boats were manned by crews totalling about 40 men . Sag Harbor was at the time garrisoned by 70 men from the Loyalist battalion of Lieutenant Colonel Stephen DeLancey . The detachment was under the command of Captain James Raymond . = = Raid = = Parsons gave command of the expedition to Colonel Return Jonathan Meigs . According to Parsons ' report to General Washington , they assembled a force totalling 234 men at New Haven from several regiments , and rowed in 13 whaleboats from New Haven to Guilford on May 21 . Rough seas and high winds prevented them from crossing for two days ; when they finally left Guilford on the afternoon of May 23 , they were accompanied on the crossing by two armed sloops and one that was unarmed . Only 170 made the crossing to the vicinity of Southold , New York , where they arrived around 6 pm . Meigs learned that most of the British forces in the area had been ordered to march to New York City , and that only the small force of Loyalists was left at Sag Harbor . He had his men portage 11 of the whaleboats across the North Fork to the bay , and launched those boats with 130 men to cross the bay to Sag Harbor . By midnight they had crossed the bay and landed about 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) from the harbor . Meigs formed his men up and marched to the harbor , arriving about 2 am . Meigs divided his force in two . One detachment stormed the earthworks , while the other went to the harbor , where they destroyed British boats and collected provisions . The land attack was conducted in silence with fixed bayonets and only one shot was said to have been fired . The schooner opened fire on the attackers as they burned the boats , but sources are unclear if the schooner itself was taken and destroyed . Twelve boats were destroyed , and the raiders took 53 prisoners at the earth works and another 37 at the wharf , suffering no casualties in the process . The prisoners were taken back to Connecticut . = = Aftermath = = Long Island 's Loyalist communities organized their own response to the raid . In May 1779 , nine Loyalists crossed the sound and captured Connecticut militia general Gold Selleck Silliman at his home , and took him back to Long Island . Connecticut Patriots captured a judge on Long Island in November 1779 , who they exchanged for General Silliman in May 1780 .

Born 23 February 1760 in La Petite-Pierre , Alsace , Bourcier was a cavalry lieutenant when the French Revolution began . He fought with the Army of the Rhine in the War of the First Coalition . By the War of the Second Coalition , he had been promoted to brigadier general , and served in the Army of the Danube as inspector general of cavalry . In the Napoleonic Wars , he fought at major campaigns on the Danube against Austria and Russia , including the battles of Elchingen , Austerlitz and the Battle of Wagram . He also participated in the campaign against Prussia , which culminated in the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt and the battles of Heilsberg and Friedland . Following the campaign in Prussia , he served briefly in the Peninsular War after he which he was transferred back to northern Europe and participated in the French Invasion of Russia in 1812 . Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 , he retained his titles and honors . After serving in the Chamber of Deputies , Bourcier died 8 May 1828 at his chateau in Ville-au-Val in Meurthe-et-Moselle . = = Career = = Antoine Louis Francois Bourcier was born on 23 February 1760 near Phalsbourg , in La Petite Pierre , a small town , in the Bas-Rhin district , 24 kilometers ( 15 mi ) north of Saverne and 56 kilometers ( 35 mi ) northwest of Strasbourg . The son of a former sergeant of the guard of King Stanislas Leszczynski , he proved himself a bright student in school , and was placed in a cavalry regiment . At the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 , he was lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Cavalry . From this time , his prospects rose quickly . Appointed aide-de-campe to the Duke of Aiguillon ( 9 June 1792 ) , he later he transferred to the staff of General Adam Philippe , Comte de Custine . A general of brigade in 1793 , he became Chief of Staff of the Army of the Rhine , and was raised the following year to the rank of major general . Bourcier commanded a division of cavalry under General Jean Victor Marie Moreau , who had taken an interest in his career , and he was appointed Inspector of Cavalry on 3 August 1797 . When Jean Baptiste Jourdan formed the Army of the Danube , he appointed Bourcier as inspector of cavalry for both his force and the Army of Switzerland , under command of Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na . With command of a brigade , and as inspector of cavalry , Bourcier participated in the campaigns of the War of the Second Coalition in southwestern Germany , Switzerland , and northern Italy . In Italy , he also commanded a column of cavalry that routed a group of rebels near Andrea . In the 1805 War of the Third Coalition , as commander of a division of dragoons , he participated in the Battle of Elchingen and later the Battle of Ulm . Six weeks later , at the Battle of Austerlitz , he made several brilliant and timely charges , including one observed by several parishioners of the town of M\u00f6nitz , who had climbed the church tower to watch the action . The French infantry had been surrounded by Austrian cavalry , which pursued them down the road . Bourcier approached from the other direction with three regiments of dragoons , having left the rest of his division behind to preserve his communication lines in Raigern . Seeing the infantry beleaguered by cavalry , he led his men in a charge , giving the infantry time to escape . His own dragoons were fired upon with cannon and grapeshot , killing or wounding several men and horses , but , as he wrote later , \" [ the Russian cannon fire ] would have done more harm had they been directed better , being within half range . \" After the French victory at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt , Bourcier was placed in charge of the several thousands of horses confiscated from the Prussians . This influx of horses improved the capacity of the French cavalry , as Joachim Murat 's 11,000-strong cavalry reserve demonstrated later at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 . After the defeat of Prussia in 1807 , Bourcier was sent to Spain to support the French efforts there , but he returned to the northern European theater in time for the Battle of Wagram in July 1809 . He was also part of Napoleon 's Russian campaign , but escaped the rigors of the retreat from Moscow , having been previously sent back to Berlin to reorganize the French cavalry . The First Restoration awarded him the Cross of St. Louis . He retired in 1816 , but the following year he was recalled to the State Council and served as commissioner for the management of military supply depots . = = Family and post-military life = = In 1809 , he acquired the Chateau de Ville-au-Val at Meurthe-et-Moselle .

It marked the defeat of Simon de Montfort , Earl of Leicester , and the rebellious barons by Prince Edward \u2013 later King Edward I \u2013 who led the forces of his father , King Henry III . It took place on 4 August 1265 , near the town of Evesham , Worcestershire . With the Battle of Lewes Montfort had won control of royal government , but after the defection of several close allies and the escape from captivity of Prince Edward , he found himself on the defensive . Forced to engage the royalists at Evesham , he faced an army twice the size of his own . The battle soon turned into a massacre ; Montfort himself was killed and his body mutilated . Though the battle effectively restored royal authority , scattered resistance remained until the Dictum of Kenilworth was signed in 1267 . = = Background = = Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester , had gained a dominant position in the government of the Kingdom of England after his victory at the Battle of Lewes a year earlier . He also held the King , Prince Edward , and the King 's brother Richard of Cornwall in his custody . However , his sphere of influence rapidly began to deteriorate due to loss of key allies . In February , Robert de Ferrers , Earl of Derby was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower . An even more important collaborator , Gilbert de Clare , the Earl of Gloucester , deserted to the side of the King in May of the same year . With Gloucester 's assistance , Prince Edward escaped from Montfort 's captivity . With the Lords of the Welsh Marches now in rebellion , Montfort solicited the aid of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , the Prince of Wales . Llywelyn agreed to help , in return for full recognition of his title , and the promise that he could keep all military gains . Whatever benefits this alliance might have brought Montfort , the great concessions cost him popularity at home . Meanwhile , Edward laid siege to the town of Gloucester , which fell on 29 June . Montfort 's goal now became to unite with the forces of his son Simon , and engage with the royal army , but the younger Simon moved much too slowly westwards from London . Eventually Simon made it to the baronial stronghold of Kenilworth , but Edward managed to inflict great losses on the enemy , many of whom were quartered outside the castle walls . From there the Prince moved south , where on 4 August , using many banners captured at Kenilworth to deceive Monfort into thinking his reinforcements were arriving , he managed to trap the older Montfort in a loop of the Avon , blocking off the only bridge and thereby forcing Montfort to fight without his son 's reinforcements . When Montfort realized this , he allegedly commented : \" May the Lord have mercy upon our souls , as our bodies are theirs . \" = = Battle = = Heeding a lesson learned at the Battle of Lewes , the royals took position on the high ground . Along a ridge called Green Hill , just north of Evesham , Edward set up his forces on the left , with Gloucester commanding the right . At about eight in the morning , Montfort left the town of Evesham as a great thunderstorm began to rage . At Lewes , the baronial forces had gained confidence to win the day by a sense of divine destiny , reinforced by white crosses on their uniforms . This time the royal army had taken their lead , and wore a red cross as their distinguishing mark . According to the chronicler William Rishanger , when Montfort saw the advance of the royal troops , he exclaimed that \" They have not learned that for themselves , but were taught it by me . \" The respective forces of the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong . Montfort , facing such unfavourable numbers , decided to concentrate his forces on the centre of the enemy \u2019 s front , hoping to drive a wedge through the line . Though the tactics were initially successful , the baronial forces soon lost the initiative , especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable , and deserted at an early point . The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort 's , surrounding them . With Montfort confronted by a force twice the size of his own , on unfavourable ground , the battle rapidly turned into a massacre . With their defeat at Lewes still fresh in memory , the royalists fought with a strong sense of bitterness and resentment . As a result , and despite attempts to surrender , most of the baronial rebels were killed on the battlefield rather than taken prisoner and ransomed , as was the common custom and practice . In what has been referred to as \" an episode of noble bloodletting unprecedented since the Conquest \" , Montfort 's son Henry was killed first , then Simon himself lost his horse and died fighting . His body was mutilated ; his head , hands , feet and testicles cut off . King Henry himself , who had been in the custody of Montfort and dressed up in his colours , was barely rescued from the m\u00eal\u00e9e by Roger de Leybourne , a converted rebel . = = Aftermath = = The royals were eager to settle scores after Montfort \u2019 s defeat . At the Parliament at Winchester in September the same year , all those who had taken part in the rebellion were disinherited . Yet even though the uprising of the younger Simon Montfort in Lincolnshire was over by Christmas , scattered resistance remained . The main problem was the garrison encamped at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle , and a siege started in the summer of 1266 seemed futile . By the end of October , the royals drew up the so-called Dictum of Kenilworth , whereby rebels were allowed to buy back their land at prices dependent on their level of involvement in the rebellion . The defenders of the castle turned down the offer at first , but by the end of the year conditions had become intolerable , and in 1267 the Dictum was agreed upon . As far as wide-scale confrontations went , the Battle of Evesham and its aftermath marked the end of baronial opposition in the reign of Henry III . The kingdom now entered into a period of unity and progress that lasted until the early 1290s .",

                    "text": "Polish Legions ( Napoleonic period ) = The Polish Legions ( also known as the D\u0105browski Legions ) in the Napoleonic period , were several Polish military units that served with the French Army , mainly from 1797 to 1803 , although some units continued to serve until 1815 . After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 , many Poles believed that Revolutionary France and her allies would come to Poland 's aid . France 's enemies included Poland 's partitioners , Prussia , Austria and Imperial Russia . Many Polish soldiers , officers and volunteers therefore emigrated , especially to Italy ( leading to the expression , \" the Polish Legions in Italy \" ) and to France , where they joined forces with the local military . The number of Polish recruits soon reached many thousands . With support from Napoleon Bonaparte , Polish military units were formed , bearing Polish military ranks and commanded by Polish officers . They became known as the \" Polish Legions \" ; a Polish army in exile , under French command . Their best known Polish commanders included Jan Henryk D\u0105browski , Karol Kniaziewicz and J\u00f3zef Wybicki . The Polish Legions serving alongside the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars saw combat in most of Napoleon 's campaigns , from the West Indies , through Italy and Egypt . When the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 , many of the veterans of the Legions formed a core around which the Duchy 's army was raised under J\u00f3zef Poniatowski . This force fought a victorious war against Austria in 1809 and would go on to fight alongside the French army in numerous campaigns , culminating in the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 , which marked the end of the Napoleonic empire , including the Legions , and allied states like the Duchy of Warsaw . = = Timeframe and numbers = = Among historians there is a degree of uncertainty about the period in which the Legions existed . Magocsi et al. notes that \" the heyday of their activity \" falls in the years 1797 \u2013 1801 , while Lerski defines the Legions as units that operated between 1797 and 1803 . Similarly , Davies defines the time of their existence as five to six years . The Polish PWN Encyklopedia defines them as units operating in the period of 1797 \u2013 1801 ( in 1801 the Legions were reorganized into demi-brigades ) . The Polish WIEM Encyklopedia notes that the Legions ended with the death of most of their personnel in the Haitian campaign , which concluded in 1803 . When recounting the history of the Polish Legions , some works also describe the operations of Polish units under the French in the period after 1803 ; several smaller formations existed in that time , the most notable of which was the Vistula Legion , which existed between 1808 and 1813 . Estimates of the strength of the Polish Legions also vary and it is believed that between 20,000 and 30,000 men served in the Legions ' ranks at any one time over the course of their existence . The WIEM Encyklopedia estimate is 21,000 for the period up to 1803 . Davies suggests 25,000 for the period of up to 1802 \u2013 1803 , as does Magosci et al . Bideleux and Jeffries offer an estimate of up to 30,000 for the period up to 1801 . Most of the soldiers came from the ranks of the peasantry , with only about 10 percent being drawn from the nobility . = = Origins = = After the Third Partition of Poland ( 1795 ) , many Poles believed that revolutionary France , whose public opinion was very sympathetic to the ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791 , would come to Poland 's aid . France 's enemies included Poland 's partitioners , Prussia , Austria and Imperial Russia . Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile , the Deputation ( Deputacja ) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency ( Agencja ) of J\u00f3zef Wybicki . Many Polish soldiers , officers and volunteers therefore emigrated , especially to Italy and to France . Eventually , the Agency was successful in convincing the French government ( the Directory ) to organize a Polish military unit . As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil , the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy , the Cisalpine Republic . Jan Henryk D\u0105browski , a former high-ranking officer in the army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , began his work in 1796 \u2013 a year after the total destruction of the Commonwealth . At that time he went to Paris , and later , Milan , where his idea received support from Napoleon Bonaparte , who saw the Poles as a promising source of new recruits , and who superficially appeared receptive to the idea of liberating Poland . D\u0105browski was soon authorized by the French-allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions , which would be part of the army of the newly created Republic of Lombardy . This agreement , drafted by Napoleon , was signed on 9 January 1797 , and marked the formal creation of the Legions . = = Operational history = = = = = War of the First Coalition : Polish Legions in Italy = = = The Polish soldiers serving in the D\u0105browski Legion were granted Lombardian citizenship and were paid the same wage as other troops . They were allowed to use their own unique Polish-style uniforms , with some French and Lombardian symbols , and were commanded by other Polish speakers . By early February 1797 the Legion was 1,200 strong , having been bolstered by the arrival of many new recruits who had deserted from the Austrian army . The D\u0105browski Legion was first used against Austrians and their allies in Italy . In March 1797 it garrisoned Mantua , and by the end of the month it took part in its first combat during the Ten Days of Brescia . By the end of April the ranks of the Legion had swelled to 5,000 . At that time D\u0105browski lobbied for a plan to push through to the Polish territories in Galicia , but that was eventually rejected by Napoleon who instead decided to use those troops on the Italian front . In April , the Legion took part in quelling the uprising in Verona , known as Veronese Easters . The Treaty of Leoben signed that month , which promised peace between Austrians and French , was a blow to Polish morale , but D\u0105browski correctly assumed that it would not last . Sources vary with regards to when the singular D\u0105browski Legion was expanded into multiple Legions . Pivka and Roffe note that in May 1797 the Legion was reorganized into two formations , the first being commanded by Karol Kniaziewicz and the second by J\u00f3zef Wielhorski , each numbering about 3,750 infantry , not counting artillery support . Davies , however , states that the Second Legion was formed in 1798 under J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105czek . In July 1797 the Legions suppressed another insurrection , this time in Reggio Emilia . The Treaty of Campo Formio , signed on 18 October 1797 , resulted in another short period of relative peace . The Legions , hopeful for a renewal of the war , were seen as the most pro-French foreign forces in the Cisapline . In May 1798 the Poles helped the French to secure the Papal States , putting down some peasant revolts , and garrisoned Rome , which they entered on 3 May . D\u0105browski obtained a number of trophies from a Roman representative , that the Polish king , Jan III Sobieski , had sent there after his victory over the Ottoman Empire at the siege of Vienna in 1683 ; amongst these was an Ottoman standard which subsequently became part of the Legions ' colors , accompanying them from then on . By the end of 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz were fighting against the anti-French forces from the Kingdom of Naples , defeating them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December . Soon afterward , supplies from the captured Gaeta fortress allowed the creation of a Legion cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski . The Poles then fought at Magliano , Falari , Calvi and Capua before Naples capitulated on 23 January . = = = War of the Second Coalition : Italian front = = = The end of the 1798 and the beginning of 1799 marked the beginning of the War of the Second Coalition . Within about a year of its formation , the Legion had become about 10,000 . However , the new series of struggles proved to be much more difficult , as the anti-French coalition advanced upon Italy , now bereft of elite French units which were with Napoleon in Egypt . Overall , 1799 saw the Legions take significant casualties . In mid-1799 , the First Legion under General D\u0105browski fought against the Russians at Trebbia ( 17 \u2013 19 June 1799 ) , where it suffered heavy casualties ( only two of the five battalions survived the battle , and D\u0105browski was wounded ) . Polish legionaries also fought at the Battle of Novi ( 15 July 1799 ) , and the Second Battle of Zurich ( 26 September ) . The Second Legion also suffered heavily ; particularly in the first battles on the Adige ( 26 March \u2013 5 April 1799 ) where it is estimated that it lost about half to two thirds of its complement of 4,000 men . Its commander , General Franciszek Rymkiewicz , was killed at the Battle of Magnano on 5 April . The remainder of the Second Legion became part of the garrison at Mantua , which was soon placed under siege by the Austrians . Finally , at the end of the Siege of Mantua ( April \u2013 July ) , the French commander Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe de Foissac-Latour decided to release Polish soldiers \u2013 then under Wielhorski \u2013 into Austrian custody as the Austrians claimed them to be deserters . This marked the end of the Second Legion , as only a small number of Poles were able to evade capture ( the French were allowed to withdraw most of their forces under the condition that they would remain neutral ) . = = = War of the Second Coalition : German front = = = With the end of the Cisalpine Republic , the Legions were reorganized in France , as Napoleon ascended to power as the First Consul and decreed that foreign troops could now serve in the French Army . On 10 February the remnants of the Italian Legions were reorganized near Marseilles into the Italian Legion ( La Legion Italique ) as a 9,000-strong unit ( although soon reduced to 5,000 ) that would become part of the Army of Italy . The Legion fought at the Peschiera and Mantua . In 1800 or 1799 ( sources vary ) , Karol Kniaziewicz organized the 6,000-strong Third Legion ( the Danube Legion , or the Legion du Rhine ) to fight against the Austrians in Bavaria . The Danube Legion , bolstered by Karwowski 's cavalry unit , fought as part of the Army of the Rhine at Berg , Bernheim and Offenburg , garrisoning the fortress of Philippsbourg after the armistice of Parsdorf ( 15 July ) . Polish forces also fought in the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 . According to Davies , the Danube Legion would suffer significant casualties in the short period after the battle and the end of the campaign on 25 December that year . The size of the Legions decreased after the Treaty of Luneville ( 9 February 1801 ) , which to the disappointment of the legionnaires made no mention of Poland . The Legions was transferred to police duties in the Kingdom of Etruria . The Legions ' morale weakened as Poles were not used in any fights that seemed to directly affect the chance of Poland regaining independence . Many legionnaires , including General Kniaziewicz , felt that they had been used by the French and resigned . D\u0105browski remained in command , and reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6,000-strong units in March 1801 . On 21 December 1801 the Legions were reorganized by the French government into three demi-brigades , with the Italian ( First ) Legion forming the core of the First and Second Foreign Demi-Brigades ( 1er and 2e Demi-Brigade \u00c9trang\u00e8re ) , and the Danube ( Second ) Legion , the Third Foreign Demi-Brigade ( 3e Demi-Brigade \u00c9trang\u00e8re ) . = = = The Haitian campaign = = = In 1802 , France sent most of the disgruntled legionnaires ( two demi-brigades , 5,280 strong ) to Haiti to put down the Haitian Revolution ( on the Caribbean island of Haiti , known then as Saint Domingue , the French West Indies ) . Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue , but preferred to save his main French army for more important matters , closer to home . The now inconvenient Polish units were accompanied by contingents of Germans and Swiss French allies , as well as by French units that had fallen out of favour with Napoleon and the French high command . The Haitian campaign proved disastrous for the legionnaires . Combat casualties and tropical diseases , including the yellow fever , reduced the 5,280-strong Polish contingent to a few hundred survivors in the space of less than two years . By the time the French forces retreated from the island in 1803 , about 4,000 Poles had died ( either from disease or combat ) . Of the survivors , about 400 remained on the island , a few dozen were dispersed to the nearby islands or to the United States , and about 700 returned to France ( Urbankowski claims 6,000 sent and 330 returned ) . The Poles had little interest or desire to support the French cause in the distant colonies , once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence . In Haiti there still is a popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves ' cause and deserted the French , supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers , with entire units changing sides . In fact , the actual desertion rate was much lower ; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels . The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence . The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France 's and Napoleon 's good intentions toward Poland . = = = Wars of the Third and Fourth Coalition = = = By 1805 , during the War of the Third Coalition , the Polish troops in Italy had been renamed the 1st Polish Legion ( 1e Legion Polonaise ) and attached to the Kingdom of Italy . In 1806 , all that was left of the old D\u0105browski and Kniaziewicz 's Legions was one demi-brigade , consisting of one infantry regiment and one cavalry regiment , now in the service of the Kingdom of Naples . It fought at Castel Franco , turning the Austrian attack on 24 November 1805 , but on 3 July 1806 it suffered a severe defeat at Sant 'Eufemia a Maiella . Many Polish officers served in French army or allied formations . During the War of the Fourth Coalition , Napoleon decided to encourage Polish defections from the Prussian army , and on 20 September 1806 decreed the creation of a \" Northern Legion \" under General Zaj\u0105czek . As the Napoleon did not want to commit himself to the Polish cause , the Legion was however not explicitly Polish , and was , in Napoleon 's words , a gathering of \" children of the North \" . French armies , including the Legion units , defeated the Prussians in Saxony at the battle of Jena and Poles under D\u0105browski entered former Polish territories ( near the city of Pozna\u0144 ) , which resulted in the influx of recruits for the legion . A year later , Napoleon , having defeated the Russian armies , met with the Russian Tsar Alexander I at Tilsit and in the ensuing negotiations they agreed that a new , small Polish state under French control ( the Duchy of Warsaw ) would be created . = = = After the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw : the Vistula Legion = = = The main period that the Legions were active was between 1797 and 1803 . Although some chose to remain with the French forces , and fought in Italy under the Kingdom of Naples , in 1807 many veteran legionnaires formed a cadre for the new Army of the Duchy of Warsaw . In February 1807 , the remaining infantry and cavalry regiments who had continued in French service in Italy were reorganized in Silesia , near Breslau , into a Polish-Italian Legion ( PolaccoItalienne ) , with two new infantry regiments added from the newly liberated Polish lands . On 21 February 1808 , the Legion was relocated to France , reinforced with Poles from other French formations , and incorporated into the French army . On 31 March of that year the legion was officially named the Vistula Legion ( L\u00e9gion de la Vistule , Legia Nadwi\u015bla\u0144ska ) . By mid-1808 the Vistula Legion had a strength of 6,000 . After the Battle of Wagram ( 5 \u2013 6 July 1809 ) Napoleon attempted to form a second Polish Vistula Legion from Polish prisoners of war , but the new formation could not attract sufficient recruits , and in 1810 it was merged into the original Vistula Legion . During the Peninsular War ( 1809 \u2013 1814 ) in Spain , the Vistula Legion gained fame at the Battle of Zaragoza . In the Battle of Fuengirola , a small Polish force managed to defeat an Anglo-Spanish expeditionary force outnumbering them 10-1 , capturing their commander in the process . Other troops served in Napoleon 's Imperial Guard and the Polish Chevau-l\u00e9ger regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of Somosierra in 1808 . Another Polish cavalry regiment \u2013 the Vistula uhlans \u2013 also fought in Spain . They distinguished themselves many times there , including at the Battle of Albuhera in 1811 , where they destroyed a British infantry brigade . Their valour in that conflict inspired the British to create their own lancer units equipped with Polish-style uniforms and weapons . In 1812 , as Napoleon entered Russia , the Poles and Lithuanians rallied to Napoleon 's Grande Arm\u00e9e in the hope of resurrecting the Commonwealth . The Vistula Legion , withdrawn from Spain in early 1812 and reorganized into a division ( with a planned strength of 10,500 that was never fully attained ) was part of Napoleon 's invasion forces . Poles formed the largest foreign contingent , 98,000-strong ( the entire French Grande Arm\u00e9e was about 600,000 strong ) . Polish Lancers of the Vistula Legion were the first unit to cross the Neman River when the Grand Armee entered Russia and , as part of the Imperial Guard , the first unit to enter Moscow . They distinguished themselves in the Battle of Borodino and , under Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski ( who personally saved Napoleon 's life ) , were one of the units that served as the rear guard during Napoleon 's retreat . This later led to the claim that just as they had been the first to enter it , they were the last to leave Russia . They sustained heavy losses during the campaign : only 26,000 of the original 98,000-strong contingent returned . The elite Vistula Legion entering Russia was about 7,000 strong ; its strength at the end of the campaign was just 1,500 . The definitive end of the Polish Legions came with the conclusion of Napoleon 's career and the abolition of the Duchy of Warsaw . The Duchy was occupied by Prussian and Russian troops following Napoleon 's retreat from Russia . The Polish troops remained loyal to him until the bitter end , with Polish units holding their ground at his last battles at Leipzig ( 15 \u2013 19 October 1813 ) and Hanau ( 30 \u2013 31 October 1813 ) , where they sustained major losses . The Legion was recreated at Sedan in early 1814 , and fought at Soissons , Reims , Arcis-sur-Aube and St-Dizier . After Napoleon 's defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition , when Napoleon was forced into exile on Elba , the only unit he was allowed to keep as guards were the Polish Lancers . While many Poles returned to the Polish territories , a unit of about 325 men under Colonel Golaszewski fought in Napoleon 's final 1815 campaign , the \" Hundred Days \" , participating in the Battle of Waterloo . After Napoleon 's second and final defeat , some are said to have accompanied him to his exile on Saint Helena . = = Assessment and remembrance = = In analyzing the creation of the Polish Legions , many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state . Among the most notable of Napoleon 's contemporary Polish detractors was Ko\u015bciuszko , who refused to join the Legions , arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form . In this regard , Ko\u015bciuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient , rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty . Nevertheless , the memory of Napoleon 's Polish Legions is strong in Poland , and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there . About the Polish Legion , Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers . Despite their destruction , the Legions became legendary in Poland , helping to spread the civic and democratic ideals of the French Revolution throughout the country . The legionnaires formed a cadre for the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw and also later for the Army of the Congress Kingdom . The Legions are also notable as the source of one of the themes contained in the future Polish national anthem , Mazurek D\u0105browskiego ( Poland Is Not Yet Lost ) . Created by J\u00f3zef Wybicki , the anthem includes words promising \" the return of the Polish army from Italy to Poland \" and states that \" Poland is not lost as long as we live \" in reference to the Polish Legions . = = Fiction = = Michael Large , Song of the Legions , 2011 , a novel about the origin of the Polish Legion , ISBN 978-0-9568853-0-2 .",

The sculpture is modeled on Charles Atlas and depicts a dynamically posed soldier standing on a granite base . Montana 's original design was modified by the East Providence Memorial Committee for being \" too brutal \" . Dedicated on July 30 , 1927 , Major General Charles Pelot Summerall gave an address which highlighted the handicap placed upon the soldiers by a lack of preparedness and \" invoked the fighting ideal embodied by Montana 's doughboy . \" The World War I Memorial was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 . = = Design = = The World War I Memorial was designed by Pietro Montana , an Italian-born painter and sculptor . Montana studied at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in Manhattan , New York City , New York . Montana 's monuments were well-known , particularly in New York , and included an earlier \" Doughboy \" sculpture erected in 1920 to honor the war dead of the Bushwick , Brooklyn and Ridgewood , Queens . The success of this the earlier \" Fighting Doughboy \" memorial resulted in the production of three copies by 1921 . By 1932 , he had produced over 40 statues and won a gold medal from the National Academy of Design for \" Orphans \" in 1931 . For the design of the sculpture , Montana modeled Charles Atlas and \" strove to communicate the U.S. doughboy 's upstanding character and valor by way of a muscle-bound physique \" . In 1926 , the East Providence Memorial Committee expressed concerns that Montana 's design was \" too brutal \" and modified the original design provided by Montana . The statue was erected in 1927 , and formally dedicated on July 30 , 1927 . At the dedication , Major General Charles Pelot Summerall gave an address which highlighted the handicap placed upon the soldiers by a lack of preparedness and \" invoked the fighting ideal embodied by Montana 's doughboy . \" The sculpture of a soldier stands 7.75 feet ( 2.36 m ) tall , 2.583 feet ( 0.787 m ) wide and 2.66 feet ( 0.81 m ) deep . Ronald J. Onorato , author of the National Register nomination , writes that \" the soldier stands with legs apart , his left hand at his belt , the right at his side . The face is impassive and expressionless . He wears a disheveled infantry uniform , rough shoes , the shirt collar open and askew , the sleeves rolled back , the knee torn open , his helmet on the ground behind his left foot . ... A holster hangs from the belt on the soldier 's right hip . \" Montana signed the sculpture with \" Pietro Montana / SC / 1927 . \" The sculpture rests atop a grey granite base that is 6.33 feet ( 1.93 m ) tall , 3.166 feet ( 0.965 m ) wide and 3.5 feet ( 1.1 m ) deep . The corners of the base have small leaf designed and has 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) by 2.66 feet ( 0.81 m ) bronze reliefs with arched tops on each side . The front relief states that it was erected in the memory of the citizens of East Providence who served in World War I from 1917 to 1918 , and lists the names of twenty three soldiers . The left relief depicts a marching infantry column of one man on horseback and four on foot , the right relief depicts four or five men loading a cannon and the rear relief depicts a nurse assisting two wounded soldiers . At the time of its nomination , the sculpture was described as in \" moderately good condition \" , with the surface being both stained and pitted , but free or breaks or missing pieces . The statue still stands in its original location in front of a school that has since been re-purposed for residential housing . = = Importance = = The World War I Memorial designed by Montana is \" historically significant as the city 's principal effort to honor those who served in the first World War and because it is an unusually successful depiction of the soldier in battle . \" The larger-than-life masculine figure depicted in the sculpture stands apart from the stock figures of other war monuments by its dynamic pose , as if the soldier was \" [ arising from ] the heat of battle \" .

                    "text": "Internal Security Act ( Singapore ) = The Internal Security Act ( ISA ) of Singapore ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) is a statute that grants the executive power to enforce preventive detention , prevent subversion , suppress organized violence against persons and property , and do other things incidental to the internal security of Singapore . The present Act was originally enacted by the Parliament of Malaysia as the Internal Security Act 1960 ( No. 18 of 1960 ) , and extended to Singapore on 16 September 1963 when Singapore was a state of the Federation of Malaysia . Before a person can be detained under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs , the President must be satisfied that such detention is necessary for the purposes of national security or public order . In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President 's satisfaction . Two months after the decision , a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision . These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1989 \u2013 1990 ) , which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA . Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists , including members of the socialist opposition party , the Barisan Sosialis . Chia Thye Poh , an alleged Communist , was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998 . The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA . The ISA also empowers the authorities to prohibit political and quasi-military organizations , ban subversive documents and publications , shut down entertainments and exhibitions that are or are likely to be detrimental to the national interest , and to suppress organized violence by declaring parts of Singapore to be security areas . = = History and developments = = British colonial Malaya introduced the Emergency Regulations Ordinance 1948 on 7 July 1948 during the Malayan Emergency in response to a Communist uprising and guerrilla war . The regulations allowed the police to arrest anybody suspected of having acted or being likely to act in a way that would threaten security without evidence or a warrant , hold them incommunicado for investigation , and detain them indefinitely without the detainee ever being charged with a crime or tried in a court of law . The successor to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance , the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance 1955 ( \" PPSO \" ) , was introduced a result of the 1955 Hock Lee bus riots by the Labour Party government in Singapore . There was strong opposition to the PPSO by the party then in opposition , the People 's Action Party ( \" PAP \" ) . In 1958 , Lee Kuan Yew of the PAP accused the Lim Yew Hock government of using the PPSO to stifle political dissent . In 1960 , three years after Malaya 's independence , the Emergency was declared over . However , the Malayan Internal Security Act 1960 ( \" ISA \" ) was passed in place of the PPSO with much of the same powers . During parliamentary debates on the Act , Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman stated that the ISA would only be applied against only the remaining Communist insurgents . The Malayan Communist Party and its insurgents eventually surrendered in 1989 . Nonetheless , the ISA was retained in Malaysia . The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling , a British lawyer , author and professor . In 1989 , he commented that he \" could not imagine then that the time would come when the power of detention , carefully and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution , would be used against political opponents , welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent , peaceful activities \" . Nonetheless , he commented that he supported review of the ISA but it was not for him to say if the law should be scrapped , as \" you 've got a multi-racial society [ in Malaysia ] in which emotions can run high very quickly \" . When Singapore joined the Federation of Malaya in 1963 , the Malayan ISA was extended to Singapore . The Act was retained in Singapore even after its separation from Malaysia in 1965 . The current version of the Act is known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition . In September 2011 , the debate over whether the ISA should be retained was re-opened after Malaysia announced that it was considering repealing the ISA . Prime Minister Najib Razak stated that the Act would be abolished and replaced by new laws to safeguard peace and order . The legitimacy and relevance of the ISA were subsequently debated by former ISA detainees , the Singapore Government , and others . Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris \u2013 Punggol Group Representation Constituency , Dr. Janil Puthucheary , commented in Parliament on 18 August 2011 that \" while he felt it inappropriate to detain a citizen without trial , he is convinced by the hard logic that the safety and security of Singapore must be paramount \" . However , he agreed that there needed to be more safeguards to prevent abuse of the ISA and that \" the ISA needs to be discussed in a more transparent manner , even as the facts associated with a given detainee need to be kept secret \" . The following day , 19 October 2011 , Deputy Prime Minister , Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean explained the relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention . He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations . For the past two decades , though , preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore 's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism . Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat , as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge . Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm . In addition , the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence . Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court . What is more , disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering . However , if confidential information were withheld from the court , a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements , which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused . Finally , court proceedings may stall investigations as part of a broader network , and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved . Opposition political parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished . In its manifesto for the 2011 general election , the Workers ' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws , which allow arrests and detention without trial only under strict conditions , should be enacted to replace the ISA . The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013 . = = Legislative authority for enactment = = The legislative authority for the enactment of the ISA is Article 149 of the Constitution of Singapore , which appears in Part XII ( \" Special Powers against Subversion and Emergency Powers \" ) . Entitled \" Legislation against subversion \" , Article 149 states : ( 1 ) If an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons , whether inside or outside Singapore \u2014 ( a ) to cause , or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear , organised violence against persons or property ; ( b ) to excite disaffection against the President or the Government ; ( c ) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or other classes of the population likely to cause violence ; ( d ) to procure the alteration , otherwise than by lawful means , of anything by law established ; or ( e ) which is prejudicial to the security of Singapore , any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action or any amendment to that law or any provision in any law enacted under clause ( 3 ) is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with Article 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 or 14 , or would , apart from this Article , be outside the legislative power of Parliament . ( 2 ) A law containing such a recital as is mentioned in clause ( 1 ) shall , if not sooner repealed , cease to have effect if a resolution is passed by Parliament annulling such law , but without prejudice to anything previously done by virtue thereof or to the power of Parliament to make a new law under this Article . ( 3 ) If , in respect of any proceedings whether instituted before or after 27th January 1989 , any question arises in any court as to the validity of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by any law referred to in this Article , such question shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of any law as may be enacted by Parliament for this purpose ; and nothing in Article 93 shall invalidate any law enacted pursuant to this clause . To satisfy the requirements of Article 149 ( 1 ) , the preamble to the Malaysian ISA , which has been retained in Singapore 's ISA , contains the following recital : Whereas action has been taken by a substantial body of persons to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear organised violence against persons and property : And Whereas action has been taken and threatened by a substantial body of persons which is prejudicial to the security of Malaya : And Whereas Parliament considers if necessary to stop or prevent that action : Now therefore pursuant to Article 149 of the Constitution be it enacted by the Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong with the advice and consent of the Dewan Negara and Dewan Ra 'ayat in Parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows ... = = Provisions relating to internal security = = Part II of the ISA , the first substantive part of the Act , contains provisions relating to internal security . It is divided into six chapters : I. Prohibition of organisations and associations of a political or quasi-military character and uniforms , etc . II . Powers of preventive detention . III . Special powers relating to subversive publications , etc . IV . Control of entertainments and exhibitions . V. Other powers for the prevention of subversion . VI . Miscellaneous . = = = Prohibition of political or quasi-military organizations = = = Chapter I of Part II of the ISA empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to take action against political or quasi-military organizations and associations . It is a criminal offence to be a member or adherent of any association of persons who are organized , trained or equipped to enable them to be employed \" in usurping the functions of the police or of the Singapore Armed Forces \" or \" for the purpose of enabling them to be employed for the use or display of physical force in promoting any political or other object , or in such a manner as to arouse reasonable apprehension that they are organised or trained or equipped for that purpose \" . It is a more serious crime to promote or conspire with someone else to promote , or to participate in the control or management of , the association , or to organize or train any member or adherent of the association . The Minister is empowered to prohibit any uniform or dress to be worn in public by members or adherents of a political or quasi-military association involved in the activities mentioned in the previous paragraph , or any uniform or dress indicating an association with a political organization or with the promotion of a political object . Wearing such a uniform or dress in contravention of the Minister 's order is an offence . In addition , if the Minister considers it to be in the national interest to do , he may prohibit the \" manufacture , sale , use , wearing , display or possession of any flag , banner , badge , emblem , device , uniform or distinctive dress or any part thereof \" . Currently , the only emblem or device that is prohibited is one \" in the form of a 5-pointed red star or a hammer and sickle in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that the emblem or device was intended or was likely to be used in a manner prejudicial to the interests of Singapore or to promote or foster a purpose prejudicial to or incompatible with peace , welfare or good order in Singapore \" . It is a crime for a person to be present at or to attend any meeting or assembly organized for the participants to train or drill themselves or to be trained or drilled \" in the use of arms ... or for the purpose of practising military exercises , movements or evolutions \" . It is also a crime to train or drill other people in these manners or to take part in the control or management of an association whose members are so trained . The prohibition does not apply to members of the Singapore Armed Forces , the police , a legally constituted volunteer or local force , a visiting force lawfully present in the country , or any organization or association exempted by the Minister . = = = Preventive detention = = = Chapter II of Part II of the ISA , which allows for preventive detention ( also known as detention without trial ) , is the most conspicuous feature of the Act . It confers on the executive a discretionary power to arrest and detain without trial , when necessary , a person with a view to prevent \" that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any part thereof or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein \" . For the purposes of this provision , essential services means services relating to water , electricity , public health , fire , prisons , post , telephony , telegraphy , radiocommunication ( including broadcasting and television ) , ports , docks , harbours , public transport , and the bulk distribution of fuel and lubricants . Instead of detaining a person for the purposes mentioned above , the executive may impose other restrictions upon the person 's liberty such as curfews , requiring the reporting of his or her movements , prohibiting the person from speaking at public meetings or taking part in political activities , and travelling beyond Singapore or any part of the country . = = = = Procedure = = = = = = = = = Before detention = = = = = Before a person can be detained under the ISA , the President must be satisfied that such detention is necessary for the purposes of national security or public order . This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the detention . The detention order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8 . = = = = = Initial detention = = = = = Once an individual has been detained , there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9 , 11 and 12 of the Act . The detainee is to be informed of the grounds of detention as soon as possible , unless their disclosure is against the national interest . He or she is to be served with a copy of the detention order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the detention order was made . The detainee is also to be informed within 14 days of his or her right to make representations against the order to an advisory board , which is required to hear and consider the detainee 's representations . Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President , and has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice . The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses , and to order that documents be produced . It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention . When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister 's decision , the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released . Before exercising his discretion , the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers . Non-citizens detained under the ISA do not have a right to make representations to an advisory board . They may , within two months from the date of the detention order , make written representations to the Minister . The Minister may , but is not bound to , refer the representations to an advisory board . Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court . The burden of proving that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one , and again the Minister 's decision on the matter is final . = = = = = Extension and suspension of detention = = = = = The initial order of the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an individual be detained for up to two years . This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time . The Minister is empowered with discretion to suspend a detention order , but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time , which reactivates the detention order . Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister . If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees , the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release . The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens . When a detention order is extended , the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension . = = = = Scope of judicial review of ISA orders = = = = Under administrative law , judicial review is an exercise in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive 's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law . If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles , the Court can invalidate them . Similarly , if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution , the Court has a duty to declare it invalid . With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial , the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990 . These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively . During that period , the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments . = = = = = Before 1988 : Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs = = = = = Prior to 1988 , the Singapore case of Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1971 ) was authority for the application of the subjective discretion test for judicial review of executive power exercised under the ISA . The subjective test precludes the court from inquiring into the facts and grounds that are relied upon by the executive body in exercising its discretion . It is based on the literal interpretation of the words \" [ i ] f the President is satisfied \" that appear in section 8 of the ISA , such that no more is required than the subjective satisfaction of the President . This reasoning applies similarly to section 10 of the ISA , which requires the Minister 's satisfaction for the suspension of detention orders . = = = = = 1988 \u2013 1989 : Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs = = = = = In the case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal expanded the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion . In contrast to the subjective test , the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker 's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell within the scope of the purposes specified by the ISA . The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient . However , the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case . The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds . The subjective test was rejected for several reasons by the Court of Appeal . It held that applying the subjective test to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional . The word law in Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1980 ) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice . Hence , Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner . If the subjective test were to be adopted , it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention , therefore rendering sections 8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article 12 ( 1 ) . When the case was decided , Article 149 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties , did not cover inconsistencies with Article 12 . Also , the Court noted that adopting the objective test would be consistent with Article 93 of the Constitution , which vests judicial power in the courts . It did not , however , directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test , in conferring arbitrary powers of detention , would be inconsistent with Article 93 . Further , the Court rejected the subjective test on the basis that \" the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law \" . The rule of law requires the courts to examine the exercise of discretionary power and ensure that executive power is exercised within its legal limits . The Court of Appeal also held that legal precedents from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported a rejection of the subjective test in favour of the objective test . The subjective test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson ( 1941 ) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs ( 1941 ) . However , these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords . These courts had rejected the subjective test applied by the majority in Liversidge , preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment . In the light of these developments , the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri ( Minister for Home Affairs ) , Malaysia ( 1969 ) , which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents ' counsel had relied on in support of the subjective test , could no longer be considered good law . Additionally , Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor ( 1978 ) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia , was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test . The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act , which the ISA of Singapore is derived from . Although sections 8 and 10 of the ISA concern matters of national security , the Court held that this concern does not preclude the objective review of executive discretion . Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( 1983 ) , the Court of Appeal decided that it is up to the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security . Similarly , it should also be within the court 's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections 8 and 10 . = = = = = 1989 amendments and Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs = = = = = Parliament subsequently passed the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 and the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 . They took effect on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively . Section 8B ( 1 ) of the amended ISA provides that the law pertaining to the judicial review of decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position applicable in Singapore on 13 July 1971 , the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided . In Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1990 ) , the Court of Appeal held that these amendments reinstated the legal position set out in Lee Mau Seng as the applicable law governing judicial review in Singapore , thus prompting a return to the subjective test in reviewing the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA . The possible inconsistencies the subjective test had with respect to Articles 12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved with the passing of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 . Article 149 ( 1 ) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles 11 and 12 . This was in addition to Articles 9 , 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article 149 ( 1 ) before the amendment . Furthermore , a new Article 149 ( 3 ) provided that nothing in Article 93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article 149 . Hence , the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed , and the subjective test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore . The Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 also introduced section 8B ( 2 ) , which is an ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA . In Teo Soh Lung , the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary for it to decide if the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case . Hence , the position remains to be confirmed by the courts . In addition , the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the effect of section 8B ( 2 ) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA . Parliament also introduced into the ISA section 8D , which dictates that the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 is to be applied retrospectively to proceedings instituted \" before or after \" 30 January 1989 . Article 11 ( 1 ) of the Constitution states : \" No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made , and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed . \" Though the 1989 amendments to the ISA did not retrospectively introduce any criminal offences , the legislature saw fit to amend Article 149 ( 1 ) by inserting a reference to Article 11 to forestall any possible arguments on section 8D 's inconsistency with the Article . As the Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said in Parliament : \" The reference to Article 11 is necessary to ensure the retrospective application of the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Bill is not challenged . \" The test for judicial review on matters not relating to the ISA remains the objective test . In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1992 ) , the High Court held that validity of detention under the Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions ) Act is not dependent on the Minister 's subjective satisfaction . Rather , the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated with criminal activities . = = = = Academic views = = = = = = = = = Mala fides situations = = = = = While the current law in Singapore holds that the Home Affairs Minister 's decision is subjective and not judicially reviewable , there is uncertainty whether there are exceptional situations in which the courts may still step in to practice judicial review even though the ISA deals with national security matters . A possible exception is when the Minister 's decision was made mala fides , that is , in bad faith . Such decisions would involve the clear abuse of power , such as being \" detained solely for having red hair or for failing a professional examination or for having acted as a lawyer against the Government \" . However , the law on this issue is presently unclear . In Lee Mau Seng , the High Court said that mala fides was not a justiciable issue in relation to the ISA . A similar stance was taken in Malaysia in Karam Singh . However , in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal said that it did not need to decide whether Lee Mau Seng has precluded judicial review in mala fides situations until a case with a mala fides factual situation arises . Furthermore , there is an increasing number of Malaysian cases reflecting \" a gradual recognition that ... indicate a retreat from the purely subjective approach \" . In response to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng , academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it . One is that the definition of mala fides used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually unreasonableness and not mala fides in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith . In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly ( 1977 ) , Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is \" dishonesty \" and \" always involves a grave charge \" . This contrasts with the meaning of mala fides in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness . Thus , an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts . = = = = = Freezing of the common law = = = = = After the 1989 amendments to the Constitution and the ISA , there was academic discourse on the effect of section 8B ( 1 ) on the future development of the common law . The amendments merely caused a time warp in the common law , taking it back to 1971 . As they did not amount to a codifying or declaratory Act seeking to replace the common law of judicial review , there is uncertainty whether the courts may continue to develop the common law and move away from the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng . Michael Rutter has asserted that the common law can indeed continue to change . While the Parliament has the power to turn the clock back , \" the Parliament is powerless to stop the clock from running \" and \" as soon as the clock is placed back in the hands of the judiciary , the hands might race forward again \" . Such a stance has wide implications : the High Court and Court of Appeal would not be bound by Lee Mau Seng . They could rule that situations involving mala fides are judicially reviewable , or completely re-adopt the legal position stated in Chng Suan Tze . The justification is that \" if Parliament intended to render judiciary law impossible , it has only to issue its laws in a more detailed shape , so that in the vast complexity of human affairs there may always be at hand a rule sufficiently precise and definite to meet each particular case \" . = = = = = Validity of ouster clause = = = = = Another issue that has undergone academic scrutiny is the nature of section 8B ( 2 ) as an ouster clause . An ouster clause is an objectively worded provision which is drafted to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts . In Teo Soh Lung , the Court of Appeal declined to address the constitutionality of section 8B and , in particular , how section 8B ( 2 ) should be interpreted . Michael Hor has described the judiciary 's reluctance to address these points as \" an elegant piece of judicial ' kung fu ' \" in which it chose to evade the problem . In a lecture to law students in 2010 , Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong commented that , in general , \" ouster clauses may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Constitution , which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the Supreme Court \" , though he expressed no concluded opinion on the matter . However , it seems unlikely that Article 93 can be relied on to invalidate section 8B ( 2 ) since Parliament specifically enacted Article 149 ( 3 ) to protect the 1989 amendments to the ISA from inconsistency with Article 93 . Tham Chee Ho has opined that where a jurisdictional error of law is involved , judicial review will be available despite the presence of an ouster clause . However , an ouster clause still precludes judicial review of non-jurisdictional errors of law . If this distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law exists , section 8B ( 2 ) will preclude judicial review of non-jurisdictional errors of law but not jurisdictional errors . Notably , there is a difference between English and Singapore law as regards this issue . In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council , ex parte Page ( 1992 ) , Lord Browne-Wilkinson commented that the case of Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission ( 1968 ) had the effect of rendering the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law obsolete . This has limited the effect of ouster clauses in the United Kingdom since all errors of law are considered as jurisdictional . However , the Singapore courts have not yet adopted this legal position , and there are cases indicating that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law still exists . = = = = = Basic features doctrine = = = = = The basic features doctrine developed in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala ( 1973 ) and Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India ( 1980 ) by the Supreme Court of India rests on the notion that there are certain elements of the nation 's constitutional structure which cannot be amended by Parliament . In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1989 ) , the plaintiff argued that the 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power , and contravening the rule of law . The Court rejected the application of the basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution , and the fact that the framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament 's power of amendment . The Court also held that , in any case , there had been no violation of the Constitution 's basic features on the facts of the case . On appeal , the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds , and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore . = = = = = Role of the judiciary in national security matters = = = = = There are competing views over the appropriate role of the judiciary in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA . A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters . The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit the role of the courts in national security matters . In 1989 , Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were needed because the courts would effectively be responsible for national security matters if judicial review was permitted . The subjective test was deemed necessary to reserve to the executive the responsibility for national security matters , and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats . Tham Chee Ho contends that , based on the objective test set out in Chng Suan Tze , the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced . This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes , but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues . The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment . Another reason that was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the judiciary was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues . Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly , hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial . By its nature , however , preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing . Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped to determine whether there are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action . Tham agrees with this view , but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power . He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar , since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved . Thio Li-ann has opined that the 1989 measures taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate a preference for non-legal institutional checks . One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees ' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated . Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review . She contends that since Article 149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties , meaningful restraints should be placed on the wide discretionary powers under the ISA . Similarly , in Chng Suan Tze , the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive 's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power . Eunice Chua argues against adopting the subjective test and limiting judicial review to breaches of the procedures stated in the ISA . Her argument is based on the premise that courts should consider notions of substantive democracy in performing their judicial role . Chua argues that in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal should have considered whether there were sufficient safeguards for the protection of detainees after the curtailment of judicial review through constitutional and legislative amendments . She suggests that Article 151 , which provides for restrictions on preventive detention , should be read liberally in favour of detainees , bearing in mind the exclusion of fundamental liberties by Article 149 . In her view , the curtailment of judicial review should therefore be rejected , as it does not accord with the \" spirit \" of Article 151 of the Constitution which ensures safeguards for detainees . Conversely , Jayakumar argued in 1989 that judicial review is an inappropriate safeguard in preventing abuse of the detention powers under the ISA in the situation where a dishonest government is in power . He argued that judicial safeguards are illusory because such a dishonest government would \" pack the courts \" and appoint judges which would rule in their favour . He regarded the best safeguard to be for voters to elect honest and incorruptible men into the Government . = = = = Criticisms of preventive detention = = = = In 2006 , the United States Department of State noted that although the ISA had not been used against the Singapore Government 's political opponents for some years , \" political opposition and criticism remained restricted by the government 's authority to define these powers broadly . In the past , occasional government references to speech that it considered ' out-of-bounds ' were understood to be implicit threats to invoke the ISA . \" The Singapore Government itself has regularly raised the need to prevent national security threats from materializing as a justification for preventive detention . However , there have been suggestions that the criminal law is apt for dealing with this matter as well . Crimes of accessory liability such as abetment , conspiracy and unlawful assembly in the Penal Code may apply even if harm has not actualized . Furthermore , restrictions imposed by the Societies Act , as well as the offences in the Sedition Act , may be viable alternatives to preventive detention . Preventive detention has been preferred over open court trials , as it has been suggested that the criminal trial could be used as a platform for radicals to publicize their views , and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons . However , it has been suggested that an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country . Under the framework of the ISA , detainees are theoretically accorded due process . For instance , detainees have a right to make representations against their detention to an advisory board . However , Article 151 ( 3 ) of the Constitution prevents any government authority from disclosing any information which would , \" in its own opinion , be against national interest \" . Therefore , there is no means to compel the authorities to disclose information which may be pertinent for the detainee to make a proper representation to an advisory board , thus compromising due process . Moreover , the secrecy of advisory board hearings has been criticized as it may lead to the public questioning the legitimacy of the hearings , and to an impression that justice has not manifestly been done . Due to the limited form of judicial review available under the ISA , whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs . This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes ? \u2013 who guards the guardians ? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately in a manner that cripples lawful democratic opposition , the absence of judicial review would preclude the exposure of such abuse . It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose . = = = = Instances of the application of the PPSO and ISA = = = = According to The Sunday Times of 28 October 1956 , 234 people , including trade union leaders Lim Chin Siong , James Puthucheary and C. V. Devan Nair , were detained under the PPSO as suspected Communist subversives . On 2 February 1963 Operation Coldstore , a joint Malaysian \u2013 Singaporean anti-Communist operation , led to the arrest of 133 people . As of 5 April 1963 , 17 were being detained in the Federation of Malaya and 107 in Singapore , while the remaining nine had been released . On 30 October 1966 , Chia Thye Poh , leader of the leftist Barisan Sosialis political party , was detained . He was subsequently held for 32 years pursuant to the ISA , the last nine of which under forms of house arrest and civil rights restrictions , including confinement on the island of Sentosa . All such restrictions were finally lifted on 27 November 1998 . As of that date , the South China Morning Post referred to him as \" the world 's second longest serving prisoner-of-conscience after South Africa 's Nelson Mandela \" . The Straits Times of 28 May 1976 reported that 50 people allegedly involved in a Communist plot had been arrested . Among them were the playwright and theatre director Kuo Pao Kun , then a secretary for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce , and his wife Goh Lay Kuan . Kuo was detained under the ISA for four years and seven months , and his citizenship was revoked . Following his release he was placed under residence and travel restrictions until 1983 . His citizenship was reinstated in 1992 . In 1987 , in a security operation known as Operation Spectrum , 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals were detained under the ISA . They were accused of being members of a dangerous Marxist conspiracy bent on subverting the government by force and replacing it with a Marxist state . The detentions led to , among others , the Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases . Two people were arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities . Of those arrested in 1997 , one was a male permanent resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service who had used the other person , a female Singaporean , as a collaborator . Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency . One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization . All the detainees were subsequently released . From 2001 , the ISA was mainly used against al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists in Singapore . In December that year , 15 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) militant group were arrested for involvement in the Singapore embassies attack plot . JI member Mohamed Khalim bin Jaffar was detained in January 2002 ( and later released in September 2011 ) , and another 21 members were arrested and detained in August 2002 . In February 2006 , alleged JI head Mas Selamat bin Kastari was extradited from Indonesia and detained under the ISA . He escaped from custody on 27 February 2008 and was only rearrested by the Malaysian authorities on 1 April 2009 . He was transferred back to Singapore for detention under the ISA on 24 September 2010 . Between November 2006 and April 2007 , four Singaporean JI members were detained under the ISA while one had a restriction order issued against him . In addition , lawyer and lecturer Abdul Basheer s / o Abdul Kader , who radicalized himself by reading extremist propaganda on the Internet , was detained in February 2007 for preparing to engage in militant activities in Afghanistan . He was released on 21 February 2010 , but rearrested in September 2012 and detained under the ISA the following month for planning to resume jihadist terrorism against foreign military operations abroad , including leaving Singapore \u2013 illegally , if necessary \u2013 to do so . Full-time National Serviceman Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid was detained on 4 April 2010 . He was described by the media as self-radicalized , having been deeply influenced by the lectures of Feiz Mohammad and Anwar al-Aulaqi which he had accessed online . Around this time , two other people influenced by al-Aulaqi were placed under restriction orders . Between January and July 2011 , three Muslim radicals were deported to Singapore from other countries and detained . JI members Jumari bin Kamdi and Samad bin Subari were arrested in Malaysia and Indonesia respectively ; while Abdul Majid s / o Kunji Mohammad , a member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , was arrested in Malaysia . As of 13 September 2011 , there were 17 people on orders of detention , one whose detention had been suspended , and 49 people on restriction orders . On 7 March 2013 , it was mentioned in Parliament that 64 people had been detained under the ISA for activities related to terrorism since 2002 . In September 2013 , the Singapore media reported that Asyrani Hussaini had been detained in March that year and was the fifth Singaporean to have been influenced by radical ideology he had read online . Asyrani had entered Thailand illegally to take part in the armed insurgency in Southern Thailand , but was arrested and deported to Singapore . Another Singaporean , Mustafa Kamal Mohammad , was placed on a two-year restriction order from September 2013 for being a member of the MILF in the Philippines . Three Singaporean former JI members had their restriction orders lifted ; they were Jahpar Osman and Samad Subari , and Abdul Majid Kunji Mohamad who had trained with the MILF . = = = Subversive documents = = = Under Chapter III of Part II of the ISA , the minister responsible for printing presses and publications \u2013 currently the Minister for Communications and Information \u2013 is authorized to ban documents and publications that are subversive or otherwise undesirable . For instance , the Minister may prohibit ( absolutely or conditionally ) the printing , publication , sale , issue , circulation or possession of a document or publication that : ( a ) contains any incitement to violence ; ( b ) counsels disobedience to the law or to any lawful order ; ( c ) is calculated or likely to lead to a breach of the peace , or to promote feelings of hostility between different races or classes of the population ; or ( d ) is prejudicial to the national interest , public order or security of Singapore ... Such a prohibition order can extend to any past or future issue of a periodical publication , and to other publications which have been issued or appear to have been issued by the publishing house , agency or other source which issued the prohibited publication . The proprietor of a prohibited publication can lodge an objection to a prohibition order within a month of the date when the order is published in the Government Gazette to the President , whose decision on the matter is \" final and shall not be called in question in any court \" . When exercising this discretion , the President is required to follow the advice of the Cabinet . It is a criminal offence to print , publish , sell , issue , circulate , reproduce or possess a prohibited publication or an extract from it ; and to import , abet the importation of , or have in one 's possession any imported prohibited publication . There is a rebuttable presumption a person knows the contents of a publication and their nature immediately after the publication comes into his or her possession . However , it is a defence for a person to demonstrate that the publication was \" printed , published , sold , issued , circulated or reproduced , as the case may be , without his authority , consent and knowledge , and without any want of due care or caution on his part , and that he did not know and had no reason to suspect the nature of the document or publication \" . Among the publications that have been interdicted under the Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong , and the Russian political newspaper Pravda . A crime is committed if any person posts or distributes a placard , circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence , counsels disobedience to the law or a lawful order , or is likely to lead to a breach of the peace . Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally , in writing , or in any newspaper , periodical , book , circular or other printed publication is also an offence . Finally , it is an offence to carry or have in one 's possession or under one 's control a subversive document . A document is deemed to be subversive if , in whole or in part , it has a tendency : ( a ) to excite organised violence against persons or property in Singapore ; ( b ) to support , propagate or advocate any act prejudicial to the security of Singapore or the maintenance or restoration of public order therein or inciting to violence therein or counselling disobedience to the law thereof or to any lawful order therein ; or ( c ) to invite , request or demand support for or on account of any collection , subscription , contribution or donation , whether in money or in kind , for the direct or indirect benefit or use of persons who intend to act or are about to act , or have acted , in a manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or to the maintenance of public order therein , or who incite to violence therein or counsel disobedience to the law thereof or any lawful order therein . A document that purports to be a subversive document is presumed to be one until the contrary has been proved , and if it is proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document , he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature . Nevertheless , a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents and the nature of the contents of the document , and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive . The ISA places a duty on any person , any office-bearer of an association , or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay . Failure to do so without police authorization , or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence . = = = Control of entertainments and exhibitions = = = The Home Affairs Minister may , under Chapter IV of Part II of the ISA , order that any entertainment or exhibition be closed if satisfied if it \" is or is likely to be in any way detrimental to the national interest \" . Entertainment is defined by the Act as \" any game , sport , diversion , concert or amusement of any kind to which the public has or is intended to have access and in which members of the public may or may not take part , whether on payment or otherwise \" , while exhibition \" includes every display of goods , books , pictures , films or articles to which the public has or is intended to have access , whether on payment or otherwise \" . It is an offence to be the promoter of or a person concerned in the promotion of an entertainment or exhibition held or continued in contravention of an order requiring it to be closed , or the proprietor of the premises on which such an event is held . However , it is a defence to show that the event was \" promoted or continued without his authority , consent and knowledge and without any want of due care or caution on his part \" . Alternatively , to ensure that an entertainment or exhibition is not detrimental to the public interest , the Minister can impose conditions relating to the holding of the event on its promoter , every person involved in its promotion , and the proprietor of the premises on which the event is to be held . Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence , unless the person involved is able to show he or she was not responsible for the breach and exercised due care and caution . The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition , or kept open in contravention of an order by the Minister . To enable the Minister to determine whether an entertainment or exhibition should be banned or allowed to be held subject to conditions , the Minister can require that its promoter , any person involved in its promotion , or the proprietor of the premises on which it is to be held to provide information on the following matters : ( a ) particulars of persons concerned in the promotion of the entertainment or exhibition and the interests represented by those persons ; ( b ) particulars of the persons who have agreed to participate or participated in the entertainment or exhibition or have been invited to do so and the interests represented by those persons ; ( c ) the purposes to which any profits from the entertainment or exhibition are intended to be or have been applied ; and ( d ) such other matters as the Minister may direct . Furnishing false or incomplete information is an offence , and also entitles the Minister to prohibit an event from being held or direct it to be closed . The person providing the information also commits a crime if the event is held in a manner contrary to the information provided . = = = Other powers = = = Chapter VI of Part II of the ISA confers additional powers on the Minister for Home Affairs to prevent subversion . If a written law confers power on a person , body or authority to appoint people to positions , the Minister can order that he or she be provided with a list of the people from which the appointment will be made , and other information . The Minister can then direct that people whose appointment would be prejudicial to the interests of Singapore shall not be appointed or recruited . Furthermore , no person is permitted to disclose any communication received from the Minister except in the course of official duty . The Minister , if satisfied that a school or educational institution is being used for a purpose detrimental to the interests of Singapore or the public , for instruction that is detrimental to the interests of the public or pupils , or as a meeting-place of an unlawful society , can order that it be closed for a period not exceeding six months at a time . The board of managers or governors of an affected school or educational institution can lodge an objection against an order with the President , whose decision on the matter is final and may not be questioned in any court . The Minister 's power does not extend to places where the teaching \" is of a purely religious character , or for a purely religious purpose \" . A person who requires a certificate of suitability for admission to an institution of higher education must apply to the Director of Education , who must not issue a certificate if \" there appear to him to be reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant , if admitted to the institution in question , would be likely to promote , or otherwise participate in , action prejudicial to the interests or security of Singapore or any part thereof \" . A person who does not hold a certificate of suitability may not be admitted to an institution of higher learning as a student . A person who has been refused a certificate may appeal to the Home Affairs Minister , whose decision on the matter is final and cannot be called into question in any court . The Minister can forbid pupils , students , teachers or members ; any class of pupils , students , teachers or members ; or any named pupil , student , teacher or member of any school , college , educational institution or students ' union or association situated or established outside Singapore to enter into or travel within Singapore as a group unless they first obtain permission from the police to do so . An individual pupil , student , teacher or member can also be barred from Singapore if he or she intends to carry out within the country some common object of the group to which he or she belongs . The police can grant permission for such travel subject to conditions . If there is a reason for the Commissioner of Police to believe that any person : ( i ) is a pupil , student , teacher or member affected by an order made under subsection ( 1 ) [ that is , an order by the Minister that the person must obtain police permission to travel to Singapore ] ; ( ii ) has entered Singapore from a place outside and has not since the date of such entry continuously remained in Singapore for a period exceeding 3 months ; ( iii ) is not the holder of a valid identity card issued to him in Singapore in accordance with the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to identity cards and which bears an address within Singapore ; and ( iv ) has contravened or intends to contravene the provisions of any such order ; ... or any person has breached any conditions imposed , the Commissioner can require that the person leave Singapore within a certain time and remain abroad for six months or a lesser period ; or take the person into custody and remove him or her from Singapore , whereupon the person must remain out of Singapore for six months . Failure to comply with any order by the Minister or a breach of the conditions of any permission to travel to Singapore is an offence . The above provisions do not authorize the removal from Singapore of any citizen of Singapore ordinarily resident in the country . = = Provisions relating to security areas = = Part III of the ISA deals with security areas . Section 48 , which is the only provision in Chapter I of Part III , empowers the President , acting on the Cabinet 's advice , to proclaim any area in Singapore a security area if in his opinion public security in the area \" is seriously disturbed or threatened by reason of any action taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons , whether inside or outside Singapore , to cause or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear organised violence against persons or property \" and \" he considers it to be necessary for the purpose of suppressing such organised violence \" . A proclamation of a security area must be published by the Home Affairs Minister in any way that the Minister thinks necessary for bringing it to the notice of all persons who , in the Minister 's view , should have notice of it . It comes into effect once notice has been given , even if it has not yet been published in the Government Gazette . A proclamation remains in force until the President revokes it or Parliament annuls it by passing a resolution . = = = Preservation of public security = = = Chapter II of Part III of the ISA empowers the Minister to take various steps to preserve public security . Within a security area , the Minister may declare areas to be danger areas , controlled areas or protected places . No person is allowed to enter or remain in a danger area unless escorted by a member of a security force , and to enforce this prohibition security forces can take all necessary measures , including those that are \" dangerous or fatal to human life \" . A person who is injured while in a danger area unlawfully cannot make any legal claim for it , though compensation may be awarded if a compensation board thinks it is equitable to do so . The declaration of an area as a controlled area enables the Minister to order that people within the area may only reside within that portion of the area declared to be the \" residential part \" , and that they may not venture beyond the residential part during certain hours . Failure to comply with such orders is a criminal offence . If the Commissioner of Police is of the view that it is \" necessary or expedient in the interests of public security or order , for the maintenance of supplies or services essential to the life of the community , that special precautions should be taken to prevent the entry of unauthorised persons \" , he may declare a place or premises within a security area to be a protected place . While such a declaration is in force , no person is permitted to enter or remain in the place without the permission of the authority or person stated in the declaration . Persons wishing to enter a protected place must submit to being searched by police officers and other authorized persons , and must comply with directions concerning their conduct . A failure to do so can result in their removal from the protected place . It is an offence to be present in a protected place without permission , and to wilfully fail to stop after being challenged by a police officer or unlawfully refuse to submit to a search . The Commissioner of Police can take steps that he considers necessary to secure a protected place , including those that endanger the life of anyone entering the place . If the Commissioner employs such steps , he must take precautions ( including displaying prominent warning notices ) that he considers reasonably necessary to prevent accidental entry into the place . Once such precautions have been put in place , if any person enters the protected place without permission and is injured or killed , he or she is not entitled to receive any compensation or damages . The Minister can declare any fence or barrier surrounding a part of a security area to be a perimeter fence . The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over , through or under the fence , including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life . If the measures are taken in a place other than on , under or within the perimeter fence , the Commissioner must take precautions \u2013 including displaying prominent warning signs \u2013 to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area . If anyone is injured or dies as a result of a defensive measure , no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid . It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross , or pass or attempt to pass any article over , though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point ; and to damage , attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point . In the interests of public safety , the Minister can make a \" clearance order \" concerning land that is within 46 metres ( 151 ft ) of any railway , public road or perimeter fence within a security area , or land in a security area that is \" used for or in connection with the cultivation of rubber , oil palm , gutta-percha , coconut , bananas or any other fruit growing on trees , or any other agricultural or food crops \" . Such an order directs the owner or occupier of the land , their agent , or any person living in the area surrounded by a perimeter fence to clear away \" all herbage , bush and undergrowth and any other object mentioned in the order , other than permanent buildings \" , prevent the undergrowth from growing higher than 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) , and maintain the cleanliness of the land . Failure to comply with a clearance order is a criminal offence . The officer in charge of a police division that forms part of a security area can do the following : Exclusion of persons . Give a written order excluding any person or persons from the police division . Curfew . Impose a curfew on specified persons , designating that they stay indoors or within a particular area between certain hours , unless they obtain a permit to the contrary issued by a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant . Control of roads . Regulate , restrict , control or prohibit the use of a road or waterway by any person or class of persons ; or any vehicle or vessel , or type or description of vehicle or vessel . In addition , can issue permits to regulate , restrict , control or prohibit persons or classes of persons from travelling in any bus , car , train or other vehicle , or in a vessel . A police officer or member of the security forces who is of or above the rating of leading rate or rank of non-commissioned officer and on duty , or a person authorized by the officer in charge of a police division , is empowered to seize any rice or other food if , because of its quantity or situation , it \" is likely to or may become available to any persons who intend or are about to act or have recently acted in a manner prejudicial to public security or to the maintenance of public order \" . In support of this power , people , premises , vehicles and vessels can be searched without a warrant . If it appears to the Minister to be \" necessary or expedient ... in the interests of public security , or for the accommodation of any security forces \" , he or she may take possession of any land or building ( or part of a building ) in a security area . Police officers are permitted to use reasonable force when effecting the taking of possession , and the Minister can require the owner or occupier of the land or building to provide information relating to it . Once the land or building is in the Minister 's possession , he or she has wide power to determine how to use it . The Minister is entitled to disregard any legal restrictions on how it may be utilized , authorize other persons to do with the property anything which the owner or occupier is entitled to do , and ban or limit anyone from exercising rights of way over , and other rights relating to , the land or building . Anyone who feels aggrieved by the Minister taking possession of land or a building can lodge an objection with an advisory committee . The committee is required to consider the objections and any grounds against the objections put forward by the person given possession of the property , and make recommendations to the Minister . The Minister can give \" such directions [ on the recommendations ] as he may think fit \" , and award compensation . If a building or structure in a security area is left unoccupied due to an order relating to the security area , and the officer in charge of the police division in which the building or structure is situated takes the view that it may be used by \" any person or persons who intend , or are about , to act or have recently acted in a manner prejudicial to public security or by any other person who is likely to harbour any such persons \" , and it is not practical to prevent such use , the officer can authorize the destruction of the building or structure . Compensation is payable for such destruction to a person if he or she can demonstrate to the Minister that the building or structure was constructed with the consent of the person lawfully entitled to the land on which it stood , and it was not liable to be forfeited . Even if the building or structure was subject to forfeiture , the Minister can still pay compensation to the owner or occupier if the latter person can prove that it was used by persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public security or for harbouring such persons without his or her knowledge or consent , and that he or she exercised due diligence to ensure that the building would not be used in this manner . = = = Offences = = = Chapter III of Part III of the ISA creates a number of criminal offences relating to security areas . = = = = Firearms , ammunition and explosives = = = = It is an offence to carry , or have in one 's possession or under one 's control in a security area without lawful excuse , any firearm , ammunition or explosive without lawful authority . The penalty for the offence is death . The onus is on the person charged to prove that he or she has a lawful excuse for having the item , and this can only be done by demonstrating that he or she acquired the item in a lawful manner for a lawful purpose , and did not act \" in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order \" while in possession of or having control of it . Furthermore , the person charged has lawful authority to have the item only if he or she : is a police officer , member of the security forces , or person employed in the Prisons Department , and has the item in connection with the performance of his or her duty ; is licensed , or authorized without a licence , to have the item ; or has been granted an exemption by an officer in charge of a police division , or is a member of a class of persons exempted by the Commissioner of Police . However , even if any of the above situations applies to a person , he or she will not be regarded as having lawful authority if he or she has the item for the purpose of using it in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order . In Liew Sai Wah v. Public Prosecutor ( 1968 ) , the appellant was arrested at the Singapore train station for having six grenade bodies in his bag . He was charged and found guilty of possession of ammunition by the High Court , and sentenced to death . The conviction was upheld by the Federal Court of Malaysia ( then part of Singapore 's court hierarchy ) . However , on further appeal to the Privy Council , their Lordships held that grenade bodies did not come within the term ammunition , which was defined as \" ammunition for any fire-arm as hereafter defined and includes grenades , bombs and other like missiles whether capable of use with such a fire-arm or not and any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to contain any noxious liquid , gas or other thing \" . Counsel for the Public Prosecutor suggested that grenade bodies might fall within the definition of explosive , which includes \" any material for making an explosive and any apparatus , machine , implement or material used or intended to be used or adapted for causing or aiding in causing any explosion in or with any explosive , and any part of any such apparatus , machine or implement \" . However , the Privy Council declined to allow this submission as it involved the presentation of a case completely different to the one that the appellant was required to meet during his trial and the appeal before the Federal Court . The appellant was therefore acquitted . It is a crime , while in a security area , to consort with or to be found in the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm , ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above , if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order . The penalty is either death or life imprisonment . It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items . The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years . If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm , ammunition or explosive , there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above . = = = = Supplies = = = = It is an offence for a person , whether inside or outside a security area , to demand , collect or receive supplies from another person under circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that : the first person intends or is about to act , or has recently acted , in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order ; or the supplies are intended for someone who intends or is about to act , or has recently acted in such a manner , or are for a terrorist to use . It is also an offence , inside or outside a security area , to be found in possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for , or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person , in circumstances which raise the reasonable presumption referred to above . The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment . However , in the latter situation , a person will not be convicted if he or she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence . = = = = Other offences = = = = A person inside or outside a security area who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA , or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be a terrorist , but who fails to report the matter to a police officer , commits an offence punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years . However , if the person voluntarily gives full information to a police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence , he or she will not be convicted . It is also an offence to attempt to commit an offence under Part III ; to assist someone that one knows or has reasonable cause to believe has committed an offence to prevent , hinder or interfere with that person 's arrest , trial or punishment ; or generally to contravene or fail to comply with any provision of Part III or any order made , direction given or requirement imposed under Part III , or to abet any contravention or failure by another person . = = Miscellaneous provisions = = The final part of the ISA , Part IV , contains various miscellaneous provisions . Some notable provisions are described in this section . A police officer is entitled to use such force as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances , including lethal weapons : to arrest a person subject to a detention order ; to arrest a person in respect of whom the officer has reason to believe that there are grounds justifying his or her preventive detention , or that he or she has acted or is about to act or is likely to act in a manner prejudicial to national security ; to arrest a person suspected of having committed an offence under the ISA , the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act , or sections 435 or 436 of the Penal Code which criminalize the commission of mischief by fire or an explosive substance to damage property or destroy a building ; to overcome forcible resistance by a person to such an arrest ; or to prevent an arrested person from escaping or being rescued from arrest . A person who has been arrested for any of the offences mentioned above must , as soon as possible after arrest , be \" clearly warned of his liability to be shot at if he endeavours to escape from custody \" . In addition to a police officer , the power to use force can be exercised by a member of the security forces , any guard or watchman in a protected place , and any person authorized by the Commissioner of Police . Provisions exist in the ISA to make it easier to admit statements made by people charged with offences under the Act or certain offences under other laws specified in the Second Schedule to the Act . A statement is admissible in evidence in a trial and , if the person who made the statement chooses to testify during a trial , it may be used in cross-examination and to impeach his or her credit , \" whether the statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing , made at any time , whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions , by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant and whether or not interpreted to him by any other police officer or any other person concerned , or not , in the arrest \" . This is subject to two limitations : A statement is not admissible \" if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement , threat or promise having reference to the charge against that person , proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give that person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him \" . If a statement has been made by a person after being arrested , it is only admissible if the court is satisfied that a caution along the following lines was administered : \" It is my duty to warn you that you are not obliged to say anything or to answer any question , but anything you say , whether in answer to a question or not , may be given in evidence . \" However , if a person makes a statement before there is time to administer a caution , the statement remains admissible if the caution is then administered as soon as possible . Once a person has been cautioned , he or she has a right to remain silent and is not required to answer any questions . = = = Cases = = = Lee Mau Seng v.

                    "text": "Vicinage Clause = The Vicinage Clause is a provision in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution regulating the vicinity from which a jury pool may be selected . The clause says that the accused shall be entitled to a jury \" of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law \" . The Vicinage Clause limits the vicinity of criminal jury selection to both the state and the federal judicial district where the crime has been committed whereas the venue provision of Article Three of the United States Constitution regulates the location of the actual trial . The Vicinage clause has its roots in medieval English criminal procedure , the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution . The clause is one of the few constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts , along with the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and ( maybe ) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment . The Clause has led to very little litigation , in part because of its overlap ( as a practical matter ) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure . Further , with the exception of the District of Wyoming , which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana ( see below ) , no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states ( although the short-lived District of Potomac once did ) . = = Background = = = = = English law during the Colonial period = = = The Oxford English Dictionary defines \" vicinage \" as \" A number of places lying near to each other taken collectively ; an area extending to a limited distance round a particular spot ; a neighbourhood . \" The OED cites Thomas Fuller 's Church History ( 1655 ) : \" King Ethelred . . . began the tryal of Causes by a Jury of twelve men to be chosen out of the Vicenage . \" According to Blackstone , in medieval England , the \" vicinage of the jury \" referred to a jury drawn from the relevant county . A 1543 statute of Henry VIII of England permits treason committed outside the \" realm \" to be tried \" before such commissioners , and in such shire of the realm , as shall be assigned by the King 's majesty 's commission . \" Parliament renewed the statute in 1769 . This law was used to try colonists accused of treason in England . A 1772 statute of George III of the United Kingdom permits destruction of dockyards , magazines , ships , ammunition , and supplies committed outside the \" realm \" to be tried in any \" shire or county within this realm . \" A 1772 statute permitted capital crimes committed in Massachusetts to be tried in England or a neighboring province if \" an indifferent trial cannot be had within \" Massachusetts . = = = Protests from the Revolutionary period = = = The Virginia House of Burgesses condemned the renewal of the treason law on May 16 , 1769 in the Virginia Resolves : [ A ] ll Trials for Treason , Misprison for Treason , and for any Felony or Crime whatsoever , committed and done in this his Majesty 's said Colony and Dominion , by any Person or Persons residing therein , ought of right to be had , and conducted in and before his Majesty 's Courts , held within the said Colony , according to the fixed and known Course of Proceedings ; and that the seizing of any Person or Persons , residing in this Colony , suspected of any Crime whatsoever , committed therein , and sending such Person or Persons to Places beyond the Sea , to be tried , is highly derogatory of the Rights of British subjects . . . . The same resolution referred to the \" inestimable Privilege of being tried by a Jury from the Vicinage . \" The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress adopted on October 14 , 1774 , resolved : That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England , and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage , according to the course of that law . On October 26 , 1774 , the Continental Congress approved an address to the people of Quebec , drafted by Thomas Cushing , Richard Henry Lee , and John Dickinson , arguing that : [ One ] great right is that of trial by jury . This provides , that neither life , liberty nor property , can be taken from the possessor , until twelve of his unexceptionable countrymen and peers of his vicinage , who from that neighbourhood may reasonably be supposed to be acquainted with his character , and the characters of the witnesses . . . . The United States Declaration of Independence ( 1776 ) accuses King George III of \" transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences . \" = = = Drafting of the Constitution = = = The New Jersey Plan contained a provision that : \" [ N ] o person shall be liable to be tried for any criminal offense , committed within any of the United States , in any other state than that wherein the offense shall be committed . . . . \" The proposals of Alexander Hamilton and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were similar . The Committee of Detail and Committee of the Whole amended this language and included it within Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three . Article III provides : \" The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed . \" This provision received almost no debate in the Constitutional Convention . The omission of a vicinage right from the United States Constitution was among the objections of the Anti-federalists to the ratification of the Constitution . James Madison explained the omission of a vicinage clause in the Virginia Ratifying Convention as follows : It was objected yesterday , that there was no provision for a jury from the vicinage . If it could have been done with safety , it would not have been opposed . It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county . Suppose a rebellion in a whole district , would it not be impossible to get a jury ? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America . There are deviations of it in England : yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence , than have taken place there for a long time , though it be left to the legislative discretion . It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from , yet in some cases it is necessary . It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances . This is a complete and satisfactory answer . Virginia ratified the Constitution , with a proviso that a Bill of Rights , including a right to \" trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage , \" be added by amendment . North Carolina adopted the same proviso as Virginia , but refused to ratify the Constitution in its absence . New York and Rhode Island ratified the constitution with similar provisos as Virginia ( but , in the case of Rhode Island , the Sixth Amendment had already been sent to the states for ratification ) . The ratifying provisos of Massachusetts did not include a vicinage right ; a proviso including a vicinage right was considered and rejected in Pennsylvania . = = Drafting of the Clause = = = = = House = = = James Madison 's ( A-VA ) original draft of the jury provision of the Sixth Amendment provided : The trial of all crimes ( except in cases of impeachment , and cases arising in the land or naval forces , or the militia when on actual service , in time of war or public danger ) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage , with the requisite of unanimity for conviction , of the right of challenge , and other accustomed requisites . . . provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy , or in which a general insurrection may prevail , the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same state , as near as may be to the seat of the offence . Madison intended this language to replace Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three , rather than be appended to the Constitution . The Committee of Eleven of the House amended Madison 's language as follows : The trial of all crimes ( except in cases of impeachment , and in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia when on actual service in the time of war , or public danger , ) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage , with the requisite of unanimity for conviction , the right of challenge , and other accustomed requisites . . . . [ B ] ut if a crime be committed in a place in the possession of an enemy , or in which an insurrection may prevail , the indictment and trial may by law be authorized in some other place within the same State ; and if it be committed in a place not within a state , the indictment and trial may be at such place or places as the law may have directed . Aedanus Burke ( A-SC ) proposed that \" vicinage \" be replaced by \" district or county in which the offence has been committed . \" Richard Henry Lee ( A-VA ) argued that \" vicinage \" was better , \" it being a term well understood by every gentleman of legal knowledge . \" Rep. Burke 's amendment was defeated . As amended by the Committee of Eleven , this language passed the House . The Committee of Three , undertaking the task of transforming the amendments to the body of the Constitution into a separate Bill of Rights , moved the language to Article X and deleted the language concerning crimes not committed within a state . = = = Senate = = = The Senate debated the Bill of Rights from September 2 to September 9 and returned a version to the House on September 10 . The Senate deleted every clause from the House version of the Sixth Amendment , with the exception of the grand jury indictment clause . A motion to restore the House wording failed . Little is known about the Senate debate due to the illness of Senator Samuel Maclay whose journal is a key source for the proceedings of the Senate during the first Congress . A September 14 , 1789 letter from Madison to Edmund Pendleton reports : The Senate have sent back the plan of amendments with some alternations , which strike , in my opinion , at the most salutary articles . In many of the States , juries , even in criminal cases , are taken from the State at large ; in others , from districts of considerable extent ; in very few from the County alone . Hence a dislike to the restraint with respect to vicinage , which has produced a negative on that clause . . . . Several others have had a similar fate . = = = Conference Committee = = = The altered form in which the Senate returned the Bill of Rights to the House lead to a conference committee composed of members of both bodies . The members of the committee from the House proposed that the jury simply be defined as comporting with \" the accustomed requisites . \" The members of the committee from the Senate were opposed to constitutionalizing the vicinage requirement , believing that the vicinage provisions of the first Judiciary Act ( already being debate ) were sufficient . A second letter from Madison to Pendleton recounts that the Senators were inflexible in opposing a definition of the locality of Juries . The vicinage they contend is either too vague or too strict a term ; too vague if depending on limits to be fixed by the pleasure of the law , too strict if limited to the county . It was proposed to insert after the word Juries , \" with the accustomed requisites , \" leaving the definition to be construed according to the judgment of professional men . Even this could not be obtained . The truth is that in most of the States the practice is different , and hence the irreconcilable difference of ideas on the subject . In most States , jurors are drawn from the whole body of the community indiscriminately ; in others , from large districts comprehending a number of Counties ; and in a few only from a single County . The Senate suppose , also , that the provision for vicinage in the Judiciary bill will sufficiently quiet the fears which called for an amendment on this point . The committee adopted the version that passed Congress and was ratified by the states : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . . = = Interpretation = = \" Jury ... \" The Vicinage Clause applies only to petit juries , not grand juries ( although some cases finding no violation of the Clause have assumed without deciding that the Clause does apply to grand juries ) . \" ... of the State and district ... \" In murder cases arising from the Indian Territory , Navassa Island , and the No Man 's Land of the Oklahoma Panhandle , the Supreme Court has held that the Clause places no limits on the prosecution of crimes committed outside the territory of a state . The Clause does not require a jury drawn from the judicial division ( a subset of a federal judicial district ) within which the crime occurred ; rather , the jury may be drawn from any division of the district . Nor does the Clause prevent the jury from being drawn solely from a judicial division , or any other subset of a judicial district ( rather than the entire judicial district ) . \" ... wherein the crime shall have been committed , ... \" The \" wherein the crime shall have been committed \" language of the clause is in parallel with the venue provision of Article Three \u2014 \" where the said Crimes shall have been committed . \" \u2014 and with Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \u2014 \" where the offense was committed . \" The three provisions have been interpreted in tandem to refer to the locus delicti of the offense . \" ... which district shall have been previously ascertained by law \" Lower courts are split on whether the Clause requires that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence at the time the crime was committed . Some courts have held that it does . Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial . Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district , but retains the former configuration for past offenses . = = = Incorporation = = = The Third , Fifth , and Sixth Circuits have held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . = = = The perfect crime ? = = = Professor Brian C. Kalt of Michigan State University College of Law argues that the Vicinage Clause may permit the commission of the \" perfect crime \" in the portion of Yellowstone National Park within the state of Idaho because the entire park is within the District of Wyoming and the Idaho portion of the park has no residents ( and that a less perfect crime could be committed in the lightly populated Montana portion of the park ) . Kalt argues that two arguments the government might make in favor of prosecution would be unsuccessful : that the Idaho portion of the park is not part of a state and that the judicial district could be changed after the crime . However , Kalt argues that the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial strategies that would at least partially close this loophole . First , the government might be able to charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park ( for example , if the defendant ( s ) conspired elsewhere ) . Second , the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less , to which the jury right does not attach . Third , the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime . Fourth , the government might argue for a purposive , rather than textualist , interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause . Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice . This same problem also was cited by the Nevada Legislature as a reason to dissolve Bullfrog County , Nevada , a short-lived county specially created in 1987 for purposes of shifting federal transfer payments related to the creation of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility directly to the state treasury . = = Similar provisions in state constitutions = = Before the adoption of the federal Constitution , only two state constitutions provided an explicit vicinage right . The Virginia Constitution of 1776 provided : \" in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to . . . an impartial jury of twelve men of his vicinage . \" The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 read similarly , but said \" county \" instead of \" vicinage \" ; it was amended in 1790 to say \" vicinage . \" By contrast , four of the original thirteen state constitutions contained explicit criminal venue provisions . New Hampshire ( 1784 ) and Georgia ( 1777 and 1789 ) required crimes to be tried in the county where committed . Maryland ( 1776 ) and Massachusetts ( 1780 ) contained similar provisions . In Coleman 's Appeal ( 1874 ) , the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that \" a man shall only be liable to be called on to answer for civil wrongs in the forum of his home , and the tribunal of his vicinage . \"",

It was adopted on December 15 , 1791 , as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights . The Bill of Rights was originally proposed as a measure to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification . Initially , the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress , and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today . Beginning with Gitlow v. New York ( 1925 ) , the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states \u2014 a process known as incorporation \u2014 through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , the Court drew on Thomas Jefferson 's correspondence to call for \" a wall of separation between church and State \" , though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute . Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th and 21st-century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech , anonymous speech , campaign financing , pornography , and school speech ; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections . The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for defamation and libel suits , most notably in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) . Commercial speech , however , is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech , and is therefore subject to greater regulation . The Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions , and applies to a wide variety of media . In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) and New York Times v. United States ( 1971 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint \u2014 pre-publication censorship \u2014 in almost all cases . The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action . In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause , the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association . = = Text = = The amendment as adopted in 1791 reads as follows : Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . = = Background = = In 1776 , the second year of the American Revolutionary War , the Virginia colonial legislature passed a Declaration of Rights that included the sentence \" The freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty , and can never be restrained but by despotic Governments . \" Eight of the other thirteen states made similar pledges . However , these declarations were generally considered \" mere admonitions to state legislatures \" , rather than enforceable provisions . After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation , a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17 , 1787 , featuring among other changes a stronger chief executive . George Mason , a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia 's Declaration of Rights , proposed that the Constitution include a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties . Other delegates \u2014 including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison \u2014 disagreed , arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other , unnamed rights were unprotected . After a brief debate , Mason 's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations . For the constitution to be ratified , however , nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions . Opposition to ratification ( \" Anti-Federalism \" ) was partly based on the Constitution 's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties . Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification ( including Virginia , Massachusetts , and New York ) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights . The U.S. Constitution was eventually ratified by all thirteen states . In the 1st United States Congress , following the state legislatures ' request , James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments , and his proposed draft of the First Amendment read as follows : The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship , nor shall any national religion be established , nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner , or on any pretext , infringed . The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak , to write , or to publish their sentiments ; and the freedom of the press , as one of the great bulwarks of liberty , shall be inviolable . The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good ; nor from applying to the Legislature by petitions , or remonstrances , for redress of their grievances . This language was greatly condensed by Congress , and passed the House and Senate with almost no recorded debate , complicating future discussion of the Amendment 's intent . The First Amendment , along with the rest of the Bill of Rights , was submitted to the states for ratification on September 25 , 1789 , and adopted on December 15 , 1791 . = = Establishment of religion = = Thomas Jefferson wrote with respect to the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) : Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , & not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \" make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof \" , thus building a wall of separation between Church & State . Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience , I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights , convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties . In Reynolds v. United States ( 1878 ) the Supreme Court used these words to declare that \" it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere [ religious ] opinion , but was left free to reach [ only those religious ] actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order . \" Quoting from Jefferson 's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom the court stated further in Reynolds : In the preamble of this act [ . . . ] religious freedom is defined ; and after a recital ' that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion , and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency , is a dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty ' , it is declared ' that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere [ only ] when [ religious ] principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order . ' In these two sentences is found the true distinction between what properly belongs to the church and what to the State . Originally , the First Amendment applied only to the federal government , and some states continued official state religions after ratification . Massachusetts , for example , was officially Congregationalist until the 1830s . In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court incorporated the Establishment Clause ( i.e. , made it apply against the states ) : The \" establishment of religion \" clause of the First Amendment means at least this : Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church . Neither can pass laws which aid one religion , aid all religions , or prefer one religion to another . . . in the words of Jefferson , the [ First Amendment ] clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ' a wall of separation between church and State ' . . . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . In Torcaso v. Watkins ( 1961 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits states and the federal government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office . In the Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) , The Court concluded that \" government should not prefer one religion to another , or religion to irreligion . \" In a series of cases in the first decade of the 2000s \u2014 Van Orden v. Perry ( 2005 ) , McCreary County v. ACLU ( 2005 ) , and Salazar v. Buono ( 2010 ) \u2014 the Court considered the issue of religious monuments on federal lands without reaching a majority reasoning on the subject . = = = Separationists = = = Everson used the metaphor of a wall of separation between church and state , derived from the correspondence of President Thomas Jefferson . It had been long established in the decisions of the Supreme Court , beginning with Reynolds v. United States in 1879 , when the Court reviewed the history of the early Republic in deciding the extent of the liberties of Mormons . Chief Justice Morrison Waite , who consulted the historian George Bancroft , also discussed at some length the Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments by James Madison , who drafted the First Amendment ; Madison used the metaphor of a \" great barrier \" . In Everson , the Court adopted Jefferson 's words . The Court has affirmed it often , with majority , but not unanimous , support . Warren Nord , in Does God Make a Difference ? , characterized the general tendency of the dissents as a weaker reading of the First Amendment ; the dissents tend to be \" less concerned about the dangers of establishment and less concerned to protect free exercise rights , particularly of religious minorities . \" Beginning with Everson , which permitted New Jersey school boards to pay for transportation to parochial schools , the Court has used various tests to determine when the wall of separation has been breached . Everson laid down the test that establishment existed when aid was given to religion , but that the transportation was justifiable because the benefit to the children was more important . In the school prayer cases of the early 1960s , ( Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District v. Schempp ) , aid seemed irrelevant ; the Court ruled on the basis that a legitimate action both served a secular purpose and did not primarily assist religion . In Walz v. Tax Commission ( 1970 ) , the Court ruled that a legitimate action could not entangle government with religion ; in Lemon v. Kurtzman ( 1971 ) , these points were combined into the Lemon test , declaring that an action was an establishment if : the statute ( or practice ) lacked a secular purpose ; its principal or primary effect advanced or inhibited religion ; or it fostered an excessive government entanglement with religion . The Lemon test has been criticized by justices and legal scholars , but it remains the predominant means by which the Court enforces the Establishment Clause . In Agostini v. Felton ( 1997 ) , the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice . In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris ( 2002 ) , the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect ; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test . Further tests , such as the endorsement test and coercion test , have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause . In Lemon the Court stated that that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : \" Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable \" , the court wrote . \" Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a ' wall ' , is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . \" = = = Accommodationists = = = Accommodationists , in contrast , argue along with Justice William O. Douglas that \" [ w ] e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being \" . This group holds that the Lemon test should be applied selectively . As such , for many conservatives , the Establishment Clause solely prevents the establishment of a state church , not public acknowledgements of God nor \" developing policies that encourage general religious beliefs that do not favor a particular sect and are consistent with the secular government 's goals . \" = = Free exercise of religion = = \" Freedom of religion means freedom to hold an opinion or belief , but not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good order . \" In Reynolds v. United States ( 1878 ) , the Supreme Court found that while laws cannot interfere with religious belief and opinions , laws can be made to regulate some religious practices ( e.g. , human sacrifices , and the Hindu practice of suttee ) . The Court stated that to rule otherwise , \" would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land , and in effect permit every citizen to become a law unto himself . Government would exist only in name under such circumstances . \" In Cantwell v. Connecticut ( 1940 ) , the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Free Exercise Clause to the states . While the right to have religious beliefs is absolute , the freedom to act on such beliefs is not absolute . In Sherbert v. Verner ( 1963 ) , the Supreme Court required states to meet the \" strict scrutiny \" standard when refusing to accommodate religiously motivated conduct . This meant that a government needed to have a \" compelling interest \" regarding such a refusal . The case involved Adele Sherbert , who was denied unemployment benefits by South Carolina because she refused to work on Saturdays , something forbidden by her Seventh-day Adventist faith . In Wisconsin v. Yoder ( 1972 ) , the Court ruled that a law that \" unduly burdens the practice of religion \" without a compelling interest , even though it might be \" neutral on its face \" , would be unconstitutional . The need for a compelling governmental interest was narrowed in Employment Division v. Smith ( 1990 ) , which held no such interest was required under the Free Exercise Clause regarding a neutral law of general applicability that happens to affect a religious practice , as opposed to a law that targets a particular religious practice ( which does require a compelling governmental interest ) . In Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah ( 1993 ) , the Supreme Court ruled Hialeah had passed an ordinance banning ritual slaughter , a practice central to the Santer\u00eda religion , while providing exceptions for some practices such as the kosher slaughter . Since the ordinance was not \" generally applicable \" , the Court ruled that it needed to have a compelling interest , which it failed to have , and so was declared unconstitutional . In 1993 , the Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , seeking to restore the compelling interest requirement applied in Sherbert and Yoder . In City of Boerne v. Flores ( 1997 ) , the Court struck down the provisions of RFRA that forced state and local governments to provide protections exceeding those required by the First Amendment , on the grounds that while the Congress could enforce the Supreme Court 's interpretation of a constitutional right , the Congress could not impose its own interpretation on states and localities . According to the court 's ruling in Gonzales v. UDV ( 2006 ) , RFRA remains applicable to federal laws and so those laws must still have a \" compelling interest \" . = = Freedom of speech and of the press = = = = = The wording of the clause = = = The First Amendment bars Congress from \" abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press \u2026 . \" U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens commented about this phraseology in a 1993 journal article : \" I emphasize the word ' the ' in the term ' the freedom of speech ' because the definite article suggests that the draftsmen intended to immunize a previously identified category or subset of speech . \" Stevens explained that , otherwise , the clause might absurdly immunize things like false testimony under oath . Like Stevens , the journalist Anthony Lewis wrote : \" The word ' the ' can be read to mean what was understood at the time to be included in the concept of free speech . \" But what was understood at the time is not 100 % clear . In the late 1790s , the lead author of the speech and press clauses , James Madison , argued against narrowing this freedom to what had existed under English common law : The practice in America must be entitled to much more respect . In every state , probably , in the Union , the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men , of every description , which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law . Madison wrote this in 1799 , when he was in a dispute about the constitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Laws , which was legislation enacted in 1798 by President John Adams ' Federalist Party to ban seditious libel . Madison believed that legislation to be unconstitutional , and his adversaries in that dispute , such as John Marshall , advocated the narrow freedom of speech that had existed in the English common law . = = = Speech critical of the government = = = The Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of any federal law regarding the Free Speech Clause until the 20th century . For example , the Supreme Court never ruled on the Alien and Sedition Acts ; three of the Supreme Court 's justices ( riding circuit ) presided over resulting sedition trials without indicating any reservations . The leading critics of the law , Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , argued for the Acts ' unconstitutionality based on the First Amendment and other Constitutional provisions . Jefferson succeeded Adams as president , in part due to the unpopularity of the latter 's sedition prosecutions ; he and his party quickly overturned the Acts and pardoned those imprisoned by them . In the majority opinion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) , the Court noted the importance of this public debate as a precedent in First Amendment law and ruled that the Acts had been unconstitutional : \" Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court , the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history . \" = = = = World War I = = = = During the patriotic fervor of World War I and the First Red Scare , the Espionage Act of 1917 imposed a maximum sentence of twenty years for anyone who caused or attempted to cause \" insubordination , disloyalty , mutiny , or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States \" . Specifically , the Espionage Act of 1917 states that if anyone allows any enemies to enter or fly over the United States and obtain information from a place connected with the national defense , they will be punished . Hundreds of prosecutions followed . In 1919 , the Supreme Court heard four appeals resulting from these cases : Schenck v. United States , Debs v. United States , Frohwerk v. United States , and Abrams v. United States . In the first of these cases , Socialist Party of America official Charles Schenck had been convicted under the Espionage Act for publishing leaflets urging resistance to the draft . Schenck appealed , arguing that the Espionage Act violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment . In Schenck v. United States , the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Schenck 's appeal and affirmed his conviction . This conviction continued to be debated over whether Schenck went against the right to freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment . Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . , writing for the Court , explained that \" the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent . \" One week later , in Frohwerk v. United States , the court again upheld an Espionage Act conviction , this time that of a journalist who had criticized U.S. involvement in foreign wars . Both of these cases show that the government can overrule The Bill of Rights with certain acts like The Espionage Act of 1917 . It all depends on what was done to put the United States in danger . In Debs v. United States , the Court elaborated on the \" clear and present danger \" test established in Schenck . On June 16 , 1918 , Eugene V. Debs , a political activist , delivered a speech in Canton , Ohio , in which he spoke of \" most loyal comrades were paying the penalty to the working class \u2013 these being Wagenknecht , Baker and Ruthenberg , who had been convicted of aiding and abetting another in failing to register for the draft . \" Following his speech , Debs was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act . In upholding his conviction , the Court reasoned that although he had not spoken any words that posed a \" clear and present danger \" , taken in context , the speech had a \" natural tendency and a probable effect to obstruct the recruiting services \" . In Abrams v. United States , four Russian refugees appealed their conviction for throwing leaflets from a building in New York ; the leaflets argued against President Woodrow Wilson 's intervention in Russia against the October Revolution . The majority upheld their conviction , but Holmes and Justice Louis Brandeis dissented , holding that the government had demonstrated no \" clear and present danger \" in the four 's political advocacy . = = = = Extending protections = = = = The Supreme Court denied a number of Free Speech Clause claims throughout the 1920s , including the appeal of a labor organizer , Benjamin Gitlow , who had been convicted after distributing a manifesto calling for a \" revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat \" . In Gitlow v. New York ( 1925 ) , the Court upheld the conviction , but a majority also found that the First Amendment applied to state laws as well as federal laws , via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Holmes and Brandeis dissented in several more cases in this decade , however , advancing the argument that the Free Speech Clause protected a far greater range of political speech than the Court had previously acknowledged . In Whitney v. California ( 1927 ) , in which Communist Party USA organizer Charlotte Anita Whitney had been arrested for \" criminal syndicalism \" , Brandeis wrote a dissent in which he argued for broader protections for political speech : Those who won our independence . . . believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth ; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile ; that with them , discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine ; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people ; that public discussion is a political duty ; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government . In Herndon v. Lowry ( 1937 ) , the Court heard the case of African American Communist Party organizer Angelo Herndon , who had been convicted under the Slave Insurrection Statute for advocating black rule in the southern United States . In a 5 \u2013 4 decision , the Court reversed Herndon 's conviction , upholding Holmes ' \" clear and present danger \" test for the first time and arguing that the state of Georgia had not demonstrated that Herndon 's actions met this standard . In 1940 , Congress enacted the Smith Act , making it illegal to advocate \" the propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force and violence \" . The statute provided law enforcement a tool to combat Communist leaders . After Eugene Dennis was convicted in the Foley Square trial for attempting to organize a Communist Party , he petitioned for certiorari , which the Supreme Court granted . In Dennis v. United States ( 1951 ) , the Court upheld the law , 6 \u2013 2 . Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson relied on Holmes ' \" clear and present danger \" test as adapted by Learned Hand : \" In each case [ courts ] must ask whether the gravity of the ' evil ' , discounted by its improbability , justifies such invasion of free speech as necessary to avoid the danger . \" Clearly , Vinson suggested , clear and present danger did not intimate \" that before the Government may act , it must wait until the putsch is about to be executed , the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited . \" In a concurring opinion , Justice Felix Frankfurter proposed a \" balancing test \" , which soon supplanted the \" clear and present danger \" test : The demands of free speech in a democratic society as well as the interest in national security are better served by candid and informed weighing of the competing interests , within the confines of the judicial process . In Yates v. United States ( 1957 ) , the Supreme Court limited the Smith Act prosecutions to \" advocacy of action \" rather than \" advocacy in the realm of ideas \" . Advocacy of abstract doctrine remained protected while speech explicitly inciting the forcible overthrow of the government was punishable under the Smith Act . During the Vietnam War , the Court 's position on public criticism of the government changed drastically . Though the Court upheld a law prohibiting the forgery , mutilation , or destruction of draft cards in United States v. O 'Brien ( 1968 ) , fearing that burning draft cards would interfere with the \" smooth and efficient functioning \" of the draft system , the next year , the court handed down its decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio ( 1969 ) , expressly overruling Whitney v. California . Now the Supreme Court referred to the right to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms : [ Our ] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or cause such action . Brandenburg discarded the \" clear and present danger \" test introduced in Schenck and further eroded Dennis . In Cohen v. California ( 1971 ) , the Court voted 5 \u2013 4 to reverse the conviction of a man wearing a jacket reading \" Fuck the Draft \" in the corridors of a Los Angeles County courthouse . Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote in the majority opinion that Cohen 's jacket fell in the category of protected political speech despite the use of an expletive : \" one man 's vulgarity is another man 's lyric . \" = = = Political speech = = = = = = = Anonymous speech = = = = In Talley v. California ( 1960 ) , the Court struck down a Los Angeles city ordinance that made it a crime to distribute anonymous pamphlets . Justice Hugo Black wrote in the majority opinion : \" There can be no doubt that such an identification requirement would tend to restrict freedom to distribute information and thereby freedom of expression . . . . Anonymous pamphlets , leaflets , brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind . \" In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission ( 1995 ) , the Court struck down an Ohio statute that made it a crime to distribute anonymous campaign literature . However , in Meese v. Keene ( 1987 ) , the Court upheld the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 , under which several Canadian films were defined as \" political propaganda \" , requiring their sponsors to be identified . = = = = Campaign finance = = = = In Buckley v. Valeo ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court reviewed the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and related laws , which restricted the monetary contributions that may be made to political campaigns and expenditure by candidates . The Court affirmed the constitutionality of limits on campaign contributions , stating that they \" serve [ d ] the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion . \" However , the Court overturned the spending limits , which it found imposed \" substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech . \" The court again scrutinized campaign finance regulation in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission ( 2003 ) . The case centered on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 ( BCRA ) , a federal law that imposed new restrictions on campaign financing . The Supreme Court upheld provisions which barred the raising of soft money by national parties and the use of soft money by private organizations to fund certain advertisements related to elections . However , the Court struck down the \" choice of expenditure \" rule , which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates , or permit candidates to spend independently , but not both , which the Court agreed \" placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties ' right to make unlimited independent expenditures . \" The Court also ruled that the provision preventing minors from making political contributions was unconstitutional , relying on Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District . In Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life , Inc . ( 2007 ) , the Court sustained an \" as applied \" challenge to BCRA , holding that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election . In Davis v. Federal Election Commission ( 2008 ) , the Supreme Court declared the \" Millionaire 's Amendment \" provisions of the BCRA to be unconstitutional . The Court held that easing BCRA restrictions for an opponent of a self-financing candidate spending at least $ 350,000 of his or her own money violated the freedom of speech of the self-financing candidate . In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ( 2010 ) , the Court ruled that the BCRA 's federal restrictions on electoral advocacy by corporations or unions were unconstitutional for violating the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment . The Court overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce ( 1990 ) , which had upheld a state law that prohibited corporations from using treasury funds to support or oppose candidates in elections did not violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments . The Court also overruled the portion of McConnell that upheld such restrictions under the BCRA . In other words , the ruling was considered to hold that \" political spending is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment \" . In McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission ( 2014 ) , the Court ruled that federal aggregate limits on how much a person can donate to candidates , political parties , and political action committees , combined respectively in a two-year period known as an \u201c election cycle , \u201d violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment . = = = = Flag desecration = = = = The divisive issue of flag desecration as a form of protest first came before the Supreme Court in Street v. New York ( 1969 ) . In response to hearing an erroneous report of the murder of civil rights activist James Meredith , Sidney Street burned a 48-star U.S. flag . Street was arrested and charged with a New York state law making it a crime \" publicly [ to ] mutilate , deface , defile , or defy , trample upon , or cast contempt upon either by words or act [ any flag of the United States ] . \" In a 5 \u2013 4 decision , the Court , relying on Stromberg v. California ( 1931 ) , found that because the provision of the New York law criminalizing \" words \" against the flag was unconstitutional , and the trial did not sufficiently demonstrate that he was convicted solely under the provisions not yet deemed unconstitutional , the conviction was unconstitutional . The Court , however , \" resist [ ed ] the pulls to decide the constitutional issues involved in this case on a broader basis \" and left the constitutionality of flag-burning unaddressed . The ambiguity with regard to flag-burning statutes was eliminated in Texas v. Johnson ( 1989 ) . In that case , Gregory Lee Johnson burned an American flag at a demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas , Texas . Charged with violating a Texas law prohibiting the vandalizing of venerated objects , Johnson was convicted , sentenced to one year in prison , and fined $ 2,000 . The Supreme Court reversed his conviction in a 5 \u2013 4 vote . Justice William J. Brennan , Jr. wrote in the decision that \" if there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment , it is that government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable . \" Congress then passed a federal law barring flag burning , but the Supreme Court struck it down as well in United States v. Eichman ( 1990 ) . A Flag Desecration Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has been proposed repeatedly in Congress since 1989 , and in 2006 failed to pass the Senate by a single vote . = = = = Falsifying military awards = = = = While the unauthorized wear or sale of the Medal of Honor has been a punishable offense under federal law since the early 20th century , the Stolen Valor Act made criminal the act of not only wearing , but also verbally claiming entitlement to military awards that a person did not in fact earn . In United States v. Alvarez ( 2012 ) , the Supreme Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act , ruling that the law violated the right to free speech for the government to punish people for making false claims regarding military service or honors . The decision was a 6 \u2013 3 ruling , but the six justices in the majority could not agree on a single rationale for it . = = = Commercial speech = = = Commercial speech is speech done on behalf of a company or individual for the purpose of making a profit . Unlike political speech , the Supreme Court does not afford commercial speech full protection under the First Amendment . To effectively distinguish commercial speech from other types of speech for purposes of litigation , the Court uses a list of four indicia : The contents do \" no more than propose a commercial transaction \" . The contents may be characterized as advertisements . The contents reference a specific product . The disseminator is economically motivated to distribute the speech . Alone , each indicium does not compel the conclusion that an instance of speech is commercial ; however , \" [ t ] he combination of all these characteristics . . . provides strong support for . . . the conclusion that the [ speech is ] properly characterized as commercial speech . \" In Valentine v. Chrestensen ( 1942 ) , the Court upheld a New York City ordinance forbidding the \" distribution in the streets of commercial and business advertising matter . \" Writing for a unanimous court , Justice Owen Roberts explained : This court has unequivocally held that streets are proper places for the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion and that , though the states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest , they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in their public thoroughfares . We are equally clear that the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising . In Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council ( 1976 ) , the Court overruled Valentine and ruled that commercial speech was entitled to First Amendment protection : What is at issue is whether a State may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity , fearful of that information 's effect upon its disseminators and its recipients . . . . [ W ] e conclude that the answer to this one is in the negative . In Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association ( 1978 ) , the Court ruled that commercial speech was not protected by the First Amendment as much as other types of speech : We have not discarded the \" common-sense \" distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction , which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation , and other varieties of speech . To require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike could invite a dilution , simply by a leveling process , of the force of the [ First ] Amendment 's guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech . In Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission ( 1980 ) , the Court clarified what analysis was required before the government could justify regulating commercial speech : Is the expression protected by the First Amendment ? Lawful ? Misleading ? Fraud ? Is the asserted government interest substantial ? Does the regulation directly advance the governmental interest asserted ? Is the regulation more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest ? Six years later , the U.S. Supreme Court , applying the Central Hudson standards in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico ( 1986 ) , affirmed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico 's conclusion that Puerto Rico 's Games of Chance Act of 1948 , including the regulations thereunder , was not facially unconstitutional . The lax interpretation of Central Hudson adopted by Posadas was soon restricted under 44 Liquormart , Inc. v. Rhode Island ( 1996 ) , when the Court invalidated a Rhode Island law prohibiting the publication of liquor prices . = = = School speech = = = In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District ( 1969 ) , the Supreme Court extended free speech rights to students in school . The case involved several students who were punished for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War . The Court ruled that the school could not restrict symbolic speech that did not \" materially and substantially \" interrupt school activities . Justice Abe Fortas wrote : First Amendment rights , applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment , are available to teachers and students . It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate . . . . [ S ] chools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism . School officials do not possess absolute authority over their students . Students . . . are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect , just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State . In Healy v. James ( 1972 ) , the Court ruled that Central Connecticut State College 's refusal to recognize a campus chapter of Students for a Democratic Society was unconstitutional , reaffirming Tinker . However , since 1969 the Court has also placed several limitations on Tinker interpretations . In Bethel School District v. Fraser ( 1986 ) , the Court ruled that a student could be punished for his sexual-innuendo-laced speech before a school assembly and , in Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier ( 1988 ) , the Court found that school newspapers enjoyed fewer First Amendment protections and are subject to school censorship . In Morse v. Frederick ( 2007 ) , the Court ruled that schools could , consistent with the First Amendment , restrict student speech at school-sponsored events , even events away from school grounds , if students promote \" illegal drug use \" . = = = Obscenity = = = The federal government and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography . While the Supreme Court has generally refused to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment , pornography is subject to little regulation . However , the definitions of obscenity and pornography have changed over time . In Rosen v. United States ( 1896 ) , the Supreme Court adopted the same obscenity standard as had been articulated in a famous British case , Regina v. Hicklin ( 1868 ) . The Hicklin test defined material as obscene if it tended \" to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences , and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall \" . In the early twentieth century , literary works including An American Tragedy ( Theodore Dreiser , 1925 ) and Lady Chatterley 's Lover ( D.H. Lawrence , 1928 ) were banned for obscenity . In the federal district court case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses ( 1933 ) , Judge John M. Woolsey established a new standard to evaluate James Joyce 's novel Ulysses ( 1922 ) , stating that works must be considered in their entirety , rather than declared obscene on the basis of an individual part of the work . The Supreme Court ruled in Roth v. United States ( 1957 ) that the First Amendment did not protect obscenity . It also ruled that the Hicklin test was inappropriate ; instead , the Roth test for obscenity was \" whether to the average person , applying contemporary community standards , the dominant theme of the material , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest \" . This definition proved hard to apply , however , and in the following decade , members of the Court often reviewed films individually in a court building screening room to determine if they should be considered obscene . Justice Potter Stewart , in Jacobellis v. Ohio ( 1964 ) , famously stated that , although he could not precisely define pornography , \" I know it when I see it \" . The Roth test was expanded when the Court decided Miller v. California ( 1973 ) . Under the Miller test , a work is obscene if : ( a ) . . . \u2018 the average person , applying contemporary community standards \u2019 would find the work , as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest . . . ( b ) . . . the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law , and ( c ) . . . the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . Note that \" community \" standards \u2014 not national standards \u2014 are applied whether the material appeals to the prurient interest , leaving the question of obscenity to local authorities . Child pornography is not subject to the Miller test , as the Supreme Court decided in New York v. Ferber ( 1982 ) and Osborne v. Ohio ( 1990 ) , ruling that the government 's interest in protecting children from abuse was paramount . Personal possession of obscene material in the home may not be prohibited by law . In Stanley v. Georgia ( 1969 ) , the Court ruled that \" [ i ] f the First Amendment means anything , it means that a State has no business telling a man , sitting in his own house , what books he may read or what films he may watch . \" However , it is constitutionally permissible for the government to prevent the mailing or sale of obscene items , though they may be viewed only in private . Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition ( 2002 ) further upheld these rights by invalidating the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 , holding that , because the act \" [ p ] rohibit [ ed ] child pornography that does not depict an actual child \" it was overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment and that : First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end . The right to think is the beginning of freedom , and speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning of thought . In United States v. Williams ( 2008 ) , the Court upheld the PROTECT Act of 2003 , ruling that prohibiting offers to provide and requests to obtain child pornography did not violate the First Amendment , even if a person charged under the Act did not possess child pornography . = = = Memoirs of convicted criminals = = = In some states , there are Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from publishing memoirs for profit . These laws were a response to offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed . The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York as a violation of the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board ( 1991 ) . That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal . Instead , it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time . The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board \u2013 an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime . Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged . = = = Defamation = = = American tort liability for defamatory speech or publications traces its origins to English common law . For the first two hundred years of American jurisprudence , the basic substance of defamation law continued to resemble that existing in England at the time of the Revolution . An 1898 American legal textbook on defamation provides definitions of libel and slander nearly identical to those given by William Blackstone and Edward Coke . An action of slander required the following : Actionable words , such as those imputing the injured party : is guilty of some offense , suffers from a contagious disease or psychological disorder , is unfit for public office because of moral failings or an inability to discharge his or her duties , or lacks integrity in profession , trade or business ; That the charge must be false ; That the charge must be articulated to a third person , verbally or in writing ; That the words are not subject to legal protection , such as those uttered in Congress ; and That the charge must be motivated by malice . An action of libel required the same five general points as slander , except that it specifically involved the publication of defamatory statements . For certain criminal charges of libel , such as seditious libel , the truth or falsity of the statements was immaterial , as such laws were intended to maintain public support of the government and true statements could damage this support even more than false ones . Instead , libel placed specific emphasis on the result of the publication . Libelous publications tended to \" degrade and injure another person \" or \" bring him into contempt , hatred or ridicule \" . Concerns that defamation under common law might be incompatible with the new republican form of government caused early American courts to struggle between William Blackstone 's argument that the punishment of \" dangerous or offensive writings . . . [ was ] necessary for the preservation of peace and good order , of government and religion , the only solid foundations of civil liberty \" and the argument that the need for a free press guaranteed by the Constitution outweighed the fear of what might be written . Consequently , very few changes were made in the first two centuries after the ratification of the First Amendment . The Supreme Court 's ruling in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) fundamentally changed American defamation law . The case redefined the type of \" malice \" needed to sustain a libel case . Common law malice consisted of \" ill-will \" or \" wickedness \" . Now , a public officials seeking to sustain a civil action against a tortfeasor needed to prove by \" clear and convincing evidence \" that there was actual malice . The case involved an advertisement published in The New York Times indicating that officials in Montgomery , Alabama had acted violently in suppressing the protests of African-Americans during the civil rights movement . The Montgomery Police Commissioner , L. B. Sullivan , sued the Times for libel , stating that the advertisement damaged his reputation . The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the $ 500,000 judgment against the Times . Justice Brennan suggested that public officials may sue for libel only if the publisher published the statements in question with \" actual malice \" \u2014 \" knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not . \" In sum , the court held that \" the First Amendment protects the publication of all statements , even false ones , about the conduct of public officials except when statements are made with actual malice ( with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity ) . \" While actual malice standard applies to public officials and public figures , in Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps ( 1988 ) , the Court found that , with regard to private individuals , the First Amendment does \" not necessarily force any change in at least some features of the common-law landscape . \" In Dun & Bradstreet , Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders , Inc . ( 1985 ) the Court ruled that \" actual malice \" need not be shown in cases involving private individuals , holding that \" [ i ] n light of the reduced constitutional value of speech involving no matters of public concern . . . the state interest adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive damages \u2014 even absent a showing of ' actual malice . ' \" In Gertz v. Robert Welch , Inc . ( 1974 ) , the Court ruled that a private individual had to prove actual malice only to be awarded punitive damages , but not to seek actual damages . In Hustler Magazine v. Falwell ( 1988 ) , the Court extended the \" actual malice \" standard to intentional infliction of emotional distress in a ruling which protected parody , in this case a fake advertisement in Hustler suggesting that evangelist Jerry Falwell 's first sexual experience had been with his mother in an outhouse . Since Falwell was a public figure , the Court ruled that \" importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern \" was the paramount concern , and reversed the judgement Falwell had won against Hustler for emotional distress . In Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co . ( 1990 ) , the Court ruled that the First Amendment offers no wholesale exception to defamation law for statements labeled \" opinion \" , but instead that a statement must be provably false ( falsifiable ) before it can be the subject of a libel suit . Nonetheless , it has been argued that Milkovich and other cases effectively provide for an opinion privilege . In consequence a significant number of states have enacted state opinion privilege laws . = = = Private action = = = State constitutions provide free speech protections similar to those of the U.S. Constitution . In a few states , such as California , a state constitution has been interpreted as providing more comprehensive protections than the First Amendment . The Supreme Court has permitted states to extend such enhanced protections , most notably in Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins . In that case , the Court unanimously ruled that while the First Amendment may allow private property owners to prohibit trespass by political speakers and petition-gatherers , California was permitted to restrict property owners whose property is equivalent to a traditional public forum ( often shopping malls and grocery stores ) from enforcing their private property rights to exclude such individuals . However , the Court did maintain that shopping centers could impose \" reasonable restrictions on expressive activity \" . Subsequently , New Jersey , Colorado , Massachusetts and Puerto Rico courts have adopted the doctrine ; California 's courts have repeatedly reaffirmed it . = = = Freedom of the press = = = The free speech and free press clauses have been interpreted as providing the same protection to speakers as to writers , except for wireless broadcasting which has been given less constitutional protection . The Free Press Clause protects the right of individuals to express themselves through publication and dissemination of information , ideas and opinions without interference , constraint or prosecution by the government . This right was described in Branzburg v. Hayes as \" a fundamental personal right \" that is not confined to newspapers and periodicals . In Lovell v. City of Griffin ( 1938 ) , Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes defined \" press \" as \" every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion \" . This right has been extended to media including newspapers , books , plays , movies , and video games . While it is an open question whether people who blog or use social media are journalists entitled to protection by media shield laws , they are protected equally by the Free Speech Clause and the Free Press Clause , because both clauses do not distinguish between media businesses and nonprofessional speakers . This is further shown by the Supreme Court consistently refusing to recognize the First Amendment as providing greater protection to the institutional media than to other speakers . For example , in a case involving campaign finance laws the Court rejected the \" suggestion that communication by corporate members of the institutional press is entitled to greater constitutional protection than the same communication by \" non-institutional-press businesses . A landmark decision for press freedom came in Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) , in which the Supreme Court rejected prior restraint ( pre-publication censorship ) . In this case , the Minnesota legislature passed a statute allowing courts to shut down \" malicious , scandalous and defamatory newspapers \" , allowing a defense of truth only in cases where the truth had been told \" with good motives and for justifiable ends \" . In a 5 \u2013 4 decision , the Court applied the Free Press Clause to the states , rejecting the statute as unconstitutional . Hughes quoted Madison in the majority decision , writing , \" The impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and official neglect emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press \" . However , Near also noted an exception , allowing prior restraint in cases such as \" publication of sailing dates of transports or the number or location of troops \" . This exception was a key point in another landmark case four decades later : New York Times Co. v. United States ( 1971 ) , in which the administration of President Richard Nixon sought to ban the publication of the Pentagon Papers , classified government documents about the Vietnam War secretly copied by analyst Daniel Ellsberg . The Court found , 6 \u2013 3 , that the Nixon administration had not met the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint . Justice Brennan , drawing on Near in a concurrent opinion , wrote that \" only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably , directly , and immediately cause the occurrence of an evil kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the issuance of an interim restraining order . \" Justices Black and Douglas went still further , writing that prior restraints were never justified . The courts have rarely treated content-based regulation of journalism with any sympathy . In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo ( 1974 ) , the Court unanimously struck down a state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses . The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility . The Supreme Court found that freedom , but not responsibility , is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish . Content-based regulation of television and radio , however , have been sustained by the Supreme Court in various cases . Since there is a limited number of frequencies for non-cable television and radio stations , the government licenses them to various companies . However , the Supreme Court has ruled that the problem of scarcity does not allow the raising of a First Amendment issue . The government may restrain broadcasters , but only on a content-neutral basis . In Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation , the Supreme Court upheld the Federal Communications Commission 's authority to restrict the use of \" indecent \" material in broadcasting . State governments retain the right to tax newspapers , just as they may tax other commercial products . Generally , however , taxes that focus exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional . In Grosjean v. American Press Co . ( 1936 ) , the Court invalidated a state tax on newspaper advertising revenues , holding that the role of the press in creating \" informed public opinion \" was vital . Similarly , some taxes that give preferential treatment to the press have been struck down . In Arkansas Writers ' Project v. Ragland ( 1987 ) , for instance , the Court invalidated an Arkansas law exempting \" religious , professional , trade and sports journals \" from taxation since the law amounted to the regulation of newspaper content . In Leathers v. Medlock ( 1991 ) , the Supreme Court found that states may treat different types of the media differently , such as by taxing cable television , but not newspapers . The Court found that \" differential taxation of speakers , even members of the press , does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at , or presents the danger of suppressing , particular ideas . \" In Branzburg v. Hayes ( 1972 ) , the Court ruled that the First Amendment did not give a journalist the right to refuse a subpoena from a grand jury . The issue decided in the case was whether a journalist could refuse to \" appear and testify before state and Federal grand juries \" basing the refusal on the belief that such appearance and testimony \" abridges the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment \" . The 5 \u2013 4 decision was that such a protection was not provided by the First Amendment . However , a concurring opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell , in which he stated that a claim for press privilege \" should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct . The balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a case-by-case basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating such questions . \" , has been frequently cited by lower courts since the decision . = = Petition and assembly = = The Petition Clause protects the right \" to petition the government for a redress of grievances \" . This includes the right to communicate with government officials , lobbying government officials and petitioning the courts by filing lawsuits with a legal basis . The Petition Clause first came to prominence in the 1830s , when Congress established the gag rule barring anti-slavery petitions from being heard ; the rule was overturned by Congress several years later . Petitions against the Espionage Act of 1917 resulted in imprisonments . The Supreme Court did not rule on either issue . In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited , 404 U.S. 508 ( 1972 ) , the Supreme Court stated that the right to petition encompass \" the approach of citizens or groups of them to administrative agencies ( which are both creatures of the legislature , and arms of the executive ) and to courts , the third branch of Government . Certainly the right to petition extends to all departments of the Government . The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition . \" Today thus this right encompasses petitions to all three branches of the federal government \u2014 the Congress , the executive and the judiciary \u2014 and has been extended to the states through incorporation . According to the Supreme Court , \" redress of grievances \" is to be construed broadly : it includes not solely appeals by the public to the government for the redressing of a grievance in the traditional sense , but also , petitions on behalf of private interests seeking personal gain . The right not only protects demands for \" a redress of grievances \" but also demands for government action . The petition clause includes according to the Supreme Court the opportunity to institute non-frivolous lawsuits and mobilize popular support to change existing laws in a peaceful manner . In Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri ( 2011 ) , the Supreme Court stated regarding the Free Speech Clause and the Petition Clause : It is not necessary to say that the two Clauses are identical in their mandate or their purpose and effect to acknowledge that the rights of speech and petition share substantial common ground . . . . Both speech and petition are integral to the democratic process , although not necessarily in the same way . The right to petition allows citizens to express their ideas , hopes , and concerns to their government and their elected representatives , whereas the right to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is integral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole realm of ideas and human affairs . Beyond the political sphere , both speech and petition advance personal expression , although the right to petition is generally concerned with expression directed to the government seeking redress of a grievance . The right of assembly was originally distinguished from the right to petition . In United States v. Cruikshank ( 1875 ) , the Supreme Court held that \" the right of the people peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances , or for anything else connected with the powers or duties of the National Government , is an attribute of national citizenship , and , as such , under protection of , and guaranteed by , the United States . The very idea of a government , republican in form , implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances . \" Justice Morrison Waite 's opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right , while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right . Later cases , however , paid less attention to these distinctions . In two 1960s decisions collectively known as forming the Noerr-Pennington doctrine , the Court established that the right to petition prohibited the application of antitrust law to statements made by private entities before public bodies : a monopolist may freely go before the city council and encourage the denial of its competitor 's building permit without being subject to Sherman Act liability . = = Freedom of association = = Although the First Amendment does not explicitly mention freedom of association , the Supreme Court ruled , in National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama ( 1958 ) , that this freedom was protected by the Amendment and that privacy of membership was an essential part of this freedom . The U.S. Supreme Court decided in Roberts v. United States Jaycees ( 1984 ) that \" implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment \" is \" a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political , social , economic , educational , religious , and cultural ends \" . In Roberts the Court held that associations may not exclude people for reasons unrelated to the group 's expression , such as gender . However , in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay , Lesbian , and Bisexual Group of Boston ( 1995 ) , the Court ruled that a group may exclude people from membership if their presence would affect the group 's ability to advocate a particular point of view . Likewise , in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale ( 2000 ) , the Court ruled that a New Jersey law , which forced the Boy Scouts of America to admit an openly gay member , to be an unconstitutional abridgment of the Boy Scouts ' right to free association .",

                    "text": "Section Thirty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms = Section 34 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the last section of Canada 's Charter of Rights , which is entrenched in the Constitution Act , 1982 . Section 34 provides guidance for the legal citation of the Charter . The section has been interpreted by Canadian writers , who have analyzed both its intention and its meaning . Because the section affirms the name of the Charter and thus entrenches it in the Constitution Act , it came into focus in 1994 when a Member of Parliament ( MP ) proposed to change the name of the Charter . = = Text = = Under the heading \" Citation , \" the section reads : = = Function = = Section 34 , as part of the Constitution Act , 1982 , came into force on April 17 , 1982 . According to the government of Canada , section 34 's function \" simply \" relates to citation . The section clarifies that the first 34 sections of the Constitution Act , 1982 may be collectively called the \" Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , \" which is an \" official name . \" This would be the name of the English version . The French version of section 34 states \" Titre de la pr\u00e9sente partie : Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . \" In 1982 , constitutional scholar Peter Hogg suggested that the section also clarifies the size and scope of the Charter . Only section 34 and the sections that come before it compose the Charter . The next sections of the Constitution Act , 1982 , including section 35 ( which affirms Aboriginal rights ) and section 36 ( which affirms equalization payments ) , are thus not Charter rights . This is significant , since section 1 of the Constitution Act , 1982 allows for limits on Charter rights , so it cannot apply to sections 35 or 36 . However , this also means that a \" judicial remedy \" under section 24 of the Act is not available for sections 35 or 36 , since section 24 refers only to the Charter . = = Discussion = = Canadian poet George Elliott Clarke once analyzed section 34 , calling it \" bland legalese . \" He wrote it was \" reassuring \" because it was dull , signalling neither fear nor excitement . Thus , it seemed to imply the Charter of Rights was not a radical constitutional change , despite the fact that it was potentially revolutionary for a constitutional monarchy . In considering the name Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , Clarke felt the first word , \" Canadian , \" hinted at Canadian nationalism . He then compared this to the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the United States Bill of Rights , saying that those documents were written by men who had just emerged from conflict and still remembered it , and thus Canada could be duller . However , he noted there was some drama in the Charter in that it was written when there was a threat of Quebec separatism , and section 27 ( multiculturalism ) , section 25 ( Aboriginal rights ) , and section 15 ( 2 ) ( affirmative action ) of the Charter could change the country . In 1994 , the Canadian House of Commons debated changing the name of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the Canadian Charter of Rights , Freedoms and Responsibilities . As Parliamentary Secretary Russell MacLellan pointed out , this would have to be done through a constitutional amendment , particularly to section 34 , since section 34 \" establishes the charter 's title . The charter 's title is thus part of the Constitution . \" MacLellan believed the amending formula needed would be the one requiring the support of seven provincial governments representing at least half of Canada 's population . Edmonton Southwest MP Ian McClelland had suggested the change , believing it to be necessary because \" I felt we were becoming a nation of entitlement . \" MacLellan replied that \" The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is and aspires to be a statement by Canadians about the rights and freedoms which we as Canadians deeply value in our democratic society . \" MacLellan added that section 1 implied a need for responsibilities , so \" It is not necessary to change the title of this charter to emphasize the integral relationship between the individual 's rights and his or her responsibility to the rest of society . \"",

                    "text": "Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom = The royal prerogative is a body of customary authority , privilege , and immunity , recognised in the United Kingdom as the sole prerogative of the Sovereign and the source of many of the executive powers of the British government . Prerogative powers were formerly exercised by the monarch acting on his or her own initiative . Since the 19th century , by convention , the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet \u2014 who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision \u2014 has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised . The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet , but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question . Today the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom , including foreign affairs , defence , and national security . The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters , but limited power , because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials . = = Definition = = The royal prerogative has been called \" a notoriously difficult concept to define adequately \" , but whether a particular type of prerogative power exists is a matter of common law to be decided by the courts as the final arbiter . A prominent constitutional theorist , A. V. Dicey , proposed in the nineteenth century that : The prerogative appears to be historically and as a matter of fact nothing else than the residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the crown . The prerogative is the name of the remaining portion of the Crown 's original authority ... Every act which the executive government can lawfully do without the authority of an Act of Parliament is done in virtue of the prerogative . While many commentators follow the Diceyan view , there are constitutional lawyers who prefer the definition given by William Blackstone in the 1760s : By the word prerogative we usually understand that special pre-eminence which the King hath , over and above all other persons , and out of the ordinary course of common law , in right of his regal dignity ... it can only be applied to those rights and capacities which the King enjoys alone , in contradiction to others , and not to those which he enjoys in common with any of his subjects . Dicey 's opinion that any action of governance by the monarch beyond statute is under the prerogative diverges from Blackstone 's that the prerogative simply covers those actions that no other person or body in the United Kingdom can undertake , such as the dissolution of Parliament . Case law exists to support both views . Blackstone \u2019 s notion of the prerogative being the powers of an exclusive nature was favoured by Lord Parmoor in the De Keyser \u2019 s Royal Hotel case of 1920 , but some difficulty with it was expressed by Lord Reid in the Burmah Oil case of 1965 . A clear distinction has not been necessary in the relevant cases , and the courts may never need to settle the question as few cases deal directly with the prerogative itself . = = History = = The royal prerogative originated as the personal power of the monarch . From the 13th century in England , as in France , the monarch was all-powerful , but this absolute power was checked by \" the recrudescence of feudal turbulence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries \" . An early attempt to define the royal prerogative was stated by Richard II 's judges in 1387 . During the 16th century , this \" turbulence \" began to recede , and the monarch became truly independent . Under Henry VIII and his successors , the king was the head of the Protestant English church , and therefore not answerable to the clergy . The rise of Parliament in this period , however , was problematic . While the monarch was \" the predominant partner in the English constitution \" , the courts stopped short of declaring him all-powerful , recognizing the role that Parliament played . In Ferrer 's Case , Henry recognised this , noting that he was far more powerful with the consent of Parliament than without . Nowhere was this more apparent than in the matter of taxation : Sir Thomas Smith and other writers of the period pointed out the monarch could not impose taxation without Parliament 's consent . At the same time , Henry and his descendants normally followed the will of the courts , despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges . William Holdsworth infers that by regularly asking the legal officers of the crown and judiciary for legal advice and consent , Henry recognised the need for a stable government to follow the law . He also contends that the view that the law is supreme over all \" was the view of all the leading lawyers and statesmen and publicists of the Tudor period \" . It was accepted that while the King had \" unfettered discretion \" , he was limited in areas where the courts had imposed conditions on the use of the prerogative , or where he had chosen to do so . The first dent in this stability came about in 1607 , with the Case of Prohibitions . James VI and I claimed that as monarch , he had a divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit . Led by Sir Edward Coke , the judiciary rejected this idea , stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual , he was subject to the law . Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law , he had no right to interpret it ; Coke pointed out that such knowledge \" demanded mastery of an artificial reason ... which requires long study and experience , before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it \" . Similarly , in the Case of Proclamations in 1611 , Coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had , and not create new ones . With the Glorious Revolution , King James VII and II was replaced by Queen Mary II and her husband King William III . At the same time the Bill of Rights 1689 was drafted , which cemented the monarch 's subservience to Parliament . It specifically limited the royal prerogative , with Article 1 holding that the \" power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal \" , and article 4 confirming that \" levying money for or to the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative , without grant of Parliament , for longer time , or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted , is illegal \" . The Bill also confirmed that Parliament had the right to limit the use of remaining prerogatives , as evidenced by the Triennial Act 1694 , which required the monarch to dismiss and call Parliament at certain times . = = Prerogative powers = = = = = Legislature = = = One of the monarch 's historic prerogatives was the dissolution of Parliament , which was \" perhaps the most important residual prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign , and represents the greatest potential for controversy . \" This prerogative was normally exercised at the request of Parliament and the prime minister , either at his or her discretion or following a motion of no confidence . Constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of Parliament would be possible today ; Sir Ivor Jennings wrote that a dissolution involves \" the acquiescence of ministers \" , and as such the monarch could not dissolve Parliament without ministerial consent ; \" if ministers refuse to give such advice , she can do no more than dismiss them \" . A. V. Dicey , however , believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single-handedly , on the condition that \" an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors ... A dissolution is allowable , or necessary , whenever the wishes of the legislature are , or may fairly be presumed to be , different from the wishes of the nation . \" The monarch could force the dissolution of Parliament through a refusal of royal assent ; this would inevitably lead to a government resigning . By convention , the monarch always assents to bills ; the last time the royal assent was not given was in 1704 during the reign of Queen Anne . This does not mean that the right to refuse has died : George V believed he could veto the Third Irish Home Rule Bill ; Jennings writes that \" it was assumed by the King throughout that he had not only the legal power but the constitutional right to refuse assent \" . The royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament was abrogated by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 . Section 6 ( 1 ) of the Act however specifically states that the monarch 's power to prorogue Parliament is not affected by the Act . The appointment of the prime minister is also , theoretically , governed by the royal prerogative . Technically the monarch may appoint as prime minister anyone she wants to appoint , but in practice the appointee is always the person who commands a majority in the House of Commons . Usually , this is the leader of the political party that is returned to Parliament with a majority of seats after a general election . Difficulties may result with a so-called hung parliament , in which no party commands majority support , as last occurred in 2010 . In this situation , constitutional convention is that the previous incumbent has the first right to form a coalition government and seek appointment . If the prime minister decides to retire in the middle of a parliamentary session , as Anthony Eden did in 1957 , the monarch has no discretion . There is usually a \" prime minister-in-waiting \" who commands the support of the majority of the Commons ; he or she will near-automatically be appointed . = = = Judicial system = = = The most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy , which has two elements : the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi . Pardons may eliminate the \" pains , penalties and punishments \" from a criminal conviction , though they do not remove convictions themselves . This power is commonly exercised on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department ; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use . Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations , a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced , on certain conditions . The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review , as confirmed by Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service , but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof , as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Bentley . Granting nolle prosequi is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales ( or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland ) in the name of the crown , to stop legal proceedings against an individual . This is not reviewable by the courts , as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents , and does not count as an acquittal ; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date . = = = Foreign affairs = = = The royal prerogative is in much use in the realm of foreign affairs . It is the monarch who recognises foreign states ( although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives ) , issues declarations of war and peace , and forms international treaties . The monarch also has the power to annex territory , as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall . Once territory has been annexed , the monarch has complete discretion as to the extent to which the government will take over the former government 's liabilities ; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King . The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory . Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful , in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights . When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890 , Parliamentary approval was first sought . The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council . The courts have long fought against the monarch 's use of this power : in R ( Bancoult ) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ( No 2 ) , the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power , although this ruling was later overturned . British passports are also issued under the prerogative , though these are also covered by statute law . Under the common law , citizens have the right freely to leave and enter the United Kingdom . In R v Foreign Secretary ex parte Everett , the courts held that it was their right to review the granting of passports to , and the withholding of passports from , British citizens . The writ of ne exeat regno is also used to prevent a person leaving the country . The right to make treaties is a disputed prerogative power : under Blackstone 's definition , a prerogative power must be one unique to the monarch . = = = Other prerogative powers = = = The monarch also has power to exercise her prerogative over the granting of honours , the regulation of the armed forces and ecclesiastical appointments . Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive , the monarch is still the person who technically awards them . Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter , the Order of the Thistle , the Order of Merit , the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain , which the monarch has complete discretion to grant . In relation to the armed forces , the monarch is the Commander in Chief , and members are regulated under the royal prerogative . Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces , although some areas , such as military discipline , are governed by Acts of Parliament . Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 , the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces , and as such their organisation , disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts . This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces , appoint commissioned officers , and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory . The prerogative empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England , and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible . R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Northumbria Police Authority , recognised that the prerogative also includes the power to \" take all reasonable steps to preserve the Queen 's peace \" , and in Burmah Oil Co. v Lord Advocate , the House of Lords took the view that it extended to \" doing all those things in an emergency which are necessary for the conduct of [ the Second World War ] . \" = = Use = = Today , the monarch exercises the prerogative almost exclusively in line with the advice of her government . Leyland notes that : The present Queen ... is kept very closely in touch with the exercise of governmental power by means of a weekly audience with the prime minister during which she is fully briefed about the affairs of government ... [ But it ] should be emphasised that the prime minister is not under any obligation to take account of royal opinions . In simple terms , the prerogative is used to govern the realm in the name of the Crown ; although the monarch has the \" right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn \" , her role involves no exercise of discretion . Today , some prerogative powers are directly exercised by ministers without the approval of Parliament , including the powers of declaring war and of making peace , the issue of passports , and the granting of honours . Prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch , but on the advice of the prime minister ( whom the monarch meets weekly ) and of the cabinet . Some key functions of the British government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative , but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis . = = = Limitations = = = Several influential decisions of the House of Lords have determined the limited scope for the use of prerogative powers . In 1915 , an appeal was made to the House of Lords , Re Petition of Right ( ' Shoreham Aerodrome Case ' ) , but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation . The appeal was from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Crown , both under the statutory Defence of the Realm Regulations and by the royal prerogative , was entitled to take and occupy , for military purposes in wartime , a commercial airfield on the south coast . The government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion ; the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised , the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists . This was backed up by The Zamora ( 1916 ) , where the Privy Council , on appeal from the Prize Court , held generally that to exercise a power not granted by statute ( such as a prerogative power ) the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified . The next decision came in Attorney General v De Keyser 's Royal Hotel Ltd ( 1920 ) , where the House of Lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use \" abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force to this extent \u2013 that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions , and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance \" . This principle of statutory superiority was extended in Laker Airway Ltd v Department of Trade , concerning the revocation of a commercial airline operator 's licence ( December 1976 ) , where it was confirmed that prerogative powers could not be used to contradict a statutory provision , and that in situations to which the power and the statute both applied , the power could only be used to further the aim of the statute . Another extension came with R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Fire Brigades Union , where the Court of Appeal held that even if a statute had not yet come into force , the prerogative could not be used to alter this statute to \" conflict with Parliament 's wishes \" . = = = Judicial review = = = Before the modern judicial review procedure superseded the petition of right as the remedy for challenging the validity of a prerogative power , the courts were traditionally only willing to state whether or not powers existed , not whether they had been used appropriately . They therefore applied only the first of the Wednesbury tests : whether the use was illegal . Constitutional scholars such as William Blackstone consider this appropriate : In the exertion therefore of those prerogatives , which the law has given him , the King is irresistible and absolute , according to the forms of the constitution . And yet if the consequence of that exertion be manifestly to the grievance or dishonour of the kingdom , the Parliament will call his advisers to a just and severe account . During the 1960s and 70s this attitude was changing , with Lord Denning saying in the Laker Airway case that \" seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good , it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive . \" The most authoritative case on the matter is Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service , generally known as the GCHQ case . The House of Lords confirmed that the application of judicial review would be dependent on the nature of the government 's powers , not their source . Foreign policy and national security powers are considered outside the scope of judicial review , while the prerogative of mercy is considered within it , as per R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Bentley . = = Reform = = Abolition of the royal prerogative is not on the immediate horizon , and recent movements to abolish the role of the monarchy and its royal prerogative in government have been unsuccessful . The Ministry of Justice undertook a \" review of executive Royal Prerogative powers \" in October 2009 . Former Labour MP and cabinet minister Tony Benn campaigned unsuccessfully for the abolition of the royal prerogative in the United Kingdom in the 1990s , arguing that all governmental powers in effect exercised on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and require parliamentary approval . Later governments argued that such is the breadth of topics covered by the royal prerogative that requiring parliamentary approval in each instance where the prerogative is currently used would overwhelm parliamentary time and slow the enactment of legislation .",

The only court that may reverse or modify a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the United States . The OSC holds court at the Oregon Supreme Court Building in Salem , Oregon , near the capitol building on State Street . The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state 's law library , while the courtroom is also used by the Oregon Court of Appeals . Tracing its heritage to 1841 when Oregon pioneers selected a supreme judge with probate powers , the court has grown from a single judge to its current make up of seven justices . Justices of the court serve six-year terms upon election , however vacancies are filled by appointments of the Governor of Oregon until the next general election when any qualified candidate may run for the position , including the appointee . These seven justices then select one member to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice . The court \u2019 s Chief Justice is not only responsible for assigning cases to the other justices to write the court \u2019 s opinions , but is also the chief executive of the Oregon Judicial Department . Primarily an appeals court , the Oregon Supreme Court is also the court of last resort in Oregon . Although most oral arguments before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building , the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools . All cases are heard en banc by the court . It receives appeals from the Oregon Tax Court , the Oregon Court of Appeals , and some select cases such as death penalty appeals . Decisions of the court are published in the Oregon Reporter published by the Oregon Judicial Department . The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was formed out of the old Oregon Country region , followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14 . = = Selection = = The court is composed of seven elected justices , each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election . Justices , like other Oregon state court judges , must be United States citizens , Oregon residents for at least three years , and lawyers admitted to practice in the state of Oregon . The newest justice receives the smallest office ( nicknamed \u201c the broom closet \u201d ) and is responsible for opening the door when a conference is interrupted . When a state court judge retires , resigns , or dies before completing a term , the Governor may appoint another qualified person to the position . To retain that position , the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next general election . On occasion , a judge will leave office at the end of a term , in which case a general election determines their replacement . If the Supreme Court needs an additional judge on a temporary basis due to illness , an unfilled position , or a justice is disqualified from sitting on a case due to a conflict of interest , the court can appoint a senior judge to serve as a judge pro tempore . Senior judges are all former , qualified judges ( a minimum of 12 years on the bench ) that have retired from a state court . Only former Supreme Court justices , elected Oregon circuit court judges , or elected Oregon Court of Appeals judges can be assigned to temporary service on the Supreme Court . = = Administrative = = The court can appoint retired judges , lawyers , and other judges to serve temporarily as judges at any level in Oregon . They can also appoint senior judges to serve on any state court at or below the highest level of court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation . The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon , disciplining attorneys , and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners . This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon . Oversight of state judges is also in the hands of the Supreme Court . The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur . The Supreme Court can then suspend judges , censure them , remove them from office , or take no action . = = = Chief Justice = = = One justice of the court is elected by the court to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice . The Chief Justice is then responsible for all administration of the Supreme Court . Under a law enacted in 1981 the chief is not only the titular head of the Supreme Court , but also is the chief executive officer of the Oregon Judicial Department . In that role the Chief Justice supervises all of the Oregon courts , appoints the Chief Judge of the Oregon Court of Appeals , assigns presiding judges for the trial level state courts , makes court rules , and is in charge of the department \u2019 s budget . As administrator the chief is also the recipient of many reports from the court system including non-legal employees of the department . The first Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court was William P. Bryant , while the longest serving chief was Wallace P. Carson , Jr. who held the position for 15 years . = = = Oregon Reports = = = Beginning in 1853 , the official court reporter for the publication of all Supreme Court decisions was the Oregon Reports , abbreviated Or. or Ore. in case citations . These bound editions are published under the authority of the Oregon Supreme Court as authorized by state law . Joseph G. Wilson started in 1853 as the clerk for the court and was responsible for the Oregon Reports until 1870 , though he also served as a justice on the court from 1862 to 1870 . Later federal judge Charles B. Bellinger then took over editing the reports , and served as clerk until 1880 . He was followed by T. B. Odeneal , J. A. Stratton , and W. H. Holmes , until 1889 when a law was passed that included a provision that the Chief Justice take over this responsibility . This arrangement only lasted a few years , as in 1891 a new law allowed the court to hire an official reporter , with later Chief Justice George H. Burnett serving as the first official reporter . The first reported opinion in the Oregon Reports was Thompson v. Backenstos , involving a case about trespassing . In the case , Justice George Henry Williams wrote the opinion , Justice Thomas Nelson had served as the judge at the trial level due to circuit riding , while future justice Reuben P. Boise served as counsel for the defense , and fellow future justice Aaron E. Waite provided counsel for the plaintiff . = = Powers and jurisdiction = = The powers of the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution \u2019 s Article VII . Like other supreme courts in the United States , the Oregon Supreme Court acts primarily as a court of appeals . They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions . In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court . Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal . With those cases that are denied an appeal to the Supreme Court , the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding . As of 1995 , the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary . The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings . Once a case is accepted , the court hears the case en banc . That is the court is not divided into panels , and instead all justices participate in all the cases , unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern . The court also reviews death penalty cases , state tax court appeals , and items regarding legal discipline on direct review . Direct review means that the Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals . Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons , placement of energy production facilities , locations of sites for solid waste disposal , and some labor law injunctions . Additionally , the court has original jurisdiction in , writs of mandamus , writs quo warranto , writs of habeas corpus , reapportionment of state legislative districts , and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles , the fiscal impact statement , and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter \u2019 s Pamphlet . Oregon \u2019 s state courts are courts of general jurisdiction , unlike federal courts . That is , the state courts can hear all cases regardless of whether the dispute is based on state law , federal law , or a combination of both , with a few exceptions . Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law . Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court , Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts . Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law , regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state . However , federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law , even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon , per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court . For this reason federal courts , and courts from other states , can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case ( see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20 ) . Although only the United States Supreme Court can overturn the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court , they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law , though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court . The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case . The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law , and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law ( see adequate and independent state ground ) . Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court , decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law . Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process . Also , in most criminal decisions Oregon \u2019 s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon ( some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur ) . = = History = = Following the journey of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805 , the region known as Oregon Country experienced increased activity and exploration by Europeans and Americans . Beginning with the fur trade , settlement by Euro-Americans began as early as 1811 with the founding of Fort Astoria and slowly increased until the 1830s . In the 1830s additional settlement occurred , agricultural production increased , and missionaries started religious missions in the region . In 1835 , the first trial in the region was held with John Kirk Townsend presiding as magistrate over a murder charge . Pioneer settlers continued to immigrate to the region , with larger wagon trains crossing the Oregon Trail in the 1840s bringing more immigrants and a need for courts . = = = Pre-statehood = = = The Oregon Supreme Court traces its roots back to the early settlement period of Oregon Country . In 1841 , pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of Idaho , Washington , and Oregon . In February of that year , settlers met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government , including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young \u2019 s estate . Although the overall government plans fell through , the group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a supreme judge to exercise probate powers . The first judge was Dr. Ira L. Babcock , serving from February 18 , 1841 , to May 1 , 1843 . In 1843 , a later set of meetings at Champoeg created the Provisional Government of Oregon with a judiciary consisting of a supreme judge and two justices of the peace for trial level courts . Albert E. Wilson was the first judge chosen as the supreme judge under this new government , but never severed . Other judges were appointed or elected during this pre-territory period over the next six years . Until 1846 with the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute , the region was not under the jurisdiction of any foreign power . With the resolution of the boundary issue , Britain retained the territory north of the 49th degree of latitude , with the United States taking the land south to the border of Mexican control California . In 1848 , when the Oregon Territory was created by the United States Congress , William P. Bryant was appointed as the first judge of the Oregon Supreme Court . Justices in the territorial period were appointed by the President of the United States . In those early days of the court , the justices would \u201c ride circuit \u201d in addition to their appellate court functions . Riding circuit involved acting as appeals court judges around the state in addition to the supreme court functions of ultimate appeal , a common practice in early American courts . = = = Oregon State Supreme Court = = = Beginning with statehood in 1859 , the court had just four justices , one for each judicial district in the state . The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices . This was set to remain until the population of the state reached 100,000 people . Each justice was assigned one district , and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals , which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed . On appeals , the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings . Then in 1862 the court was expanded to five justices with the addition of a fifth judicial district . Also that year the Court hired its first clerk after the legislature authorized that position . In 1878 , the legislature passed an act to separate the circuit and supreme courts after the population reached 100,000 . With the creation of a separate Circuit Court and Supreme Court , riding circuit was abandoned and the Supreme Court was reduced to three members , with members of each court elected separately . Governor Thayer then appointed James K. Kelly , Reuben P. Boise , and Paine Page Prim to the court as temporary justices until elections could be held . During these early years of the court the selection of the Chief Justice was governed by the Oregon Constitution , with the senior justice or the justice with their term was next to expire was designated as the Chief Justice . This meant that a new chief would be selected at least every two years , and in general meant someone elected would serve their first four years on the bench as an associate justice and the last two years as the Chief Justice . Mary Leonard became the first woman admitted to the state bar on April 13 , 1886 , when the court admitted her after a year-long battle that included the state legislature passing a new law to allow women to be admitted . In 1906 , the Oregon court upheld a maximum hour law for women in State v. Muller , 48 Or . 252 , 85 P. 855 ( 1906 ) . Due partly to a brief by future U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Oregon law in Muller v. Oregon , 208 U.S. 412 ( 1908 ) despite ruling in 1905 in Lochner v. New York that a maximum hour law for bakers was unconstitutional . Then in 1910 , the state legislature expanded the court back to five justices , and lastly , in 1913 the court expanded to the current seven justices . The next important case came in 1935 when the state 's top court ruled in State v. De Jonge , 152 Or . 315 , 51 P.2d 674 ( 1935 ) that the 14th Amendment did not protect Communist Party organizers from prosecution under Oregon \u2019 s criminal syndicate law . However , the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn this decision in DeJonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353 ( 1937 ) . Another important case came in 1960 as the Oregon court ruled against the United States government in State Land Board v. United States , 222 Or . 40 , 352 P.2d 539 ( 1960 ) . In that case the court ruled that state estate laws trumped a federal statute concerning the property of U.S. Veterans who died at Veterans Administration hospitals without a valid will . The U.S. Supreme Court then overturned the Oregon Supreme Court 's decision in United States v. Oregon , 366 U. S. 643 ( 1961 ) . On the administrative end of the court , the Oregon Court of Appeals was created in 1969 as an intermediate appellate court in Oregon . With this change , the Supreme Court now generally does not hear appeals directly from the trial level courts of the state , with some exceptions such as death penalty cases . Other changes came in 1981 when the Oregon Legislature and justice Arno Denecke reformed the chief justice position from a simple head of the court in title only , to the administrative head of the entire Oregon judicial system . The following year , 1982 , the court received its first female member when Governor Vic Atiyeh appointed Betty Roberts as an associate justice . Then from 1991 to 2005 Wallace P. Carson , Jr. served as chief justice of the court for a record 14 years . The next landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving the Oregon Supreme Court was Dolan v. City of Tigard , 512 U.S. 374 ( 1994 ) . In that land use case the Oregon court found the requirements placed on the business owner as conditions to approve an expansion were not a taking under the United States Constitution \u2019 s takings clause . However , the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed and overturned the Oregon court . Then the Oregon court ruled in February 2006 that Oregon \u2019 s land use law , Measure 37 , was constitutional . Macpherson v. Department of Administrative Services , 340 Or . 117 , 130 P.3d 308 ( 2006 ) allowed people to make claims against the government forcing the government to either pay compensation when land use regulations reduced the value of a property owners land or waive the regulation . = = = Location = = = In the early years of the Supreme Court , business was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem . The first public building to house the court was the Territorial Capitol Building in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855 . In that building the courtroom was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor . On December 29 , 1855 , after the building was partially occupied , it burned to the ground . In 1876 , the state finished construction on a second capitol building where the court was located on the third floor . This courtroom measured 54 feet by 46 feet , while the state law library was 75 feet by 70 feet . A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court , and this is now the oldest building on the Capitol Mall after the second capitol building burned down on April 25 , 1935 . In addition to holding court in the Supreme Court Building 's third floor courtroom , the court also travels around the state to hold sessions . This includes sessions at colleges , high schools , and the state \u2019 s three law schools . These three law schools , Willamette University College of Law , University of Oregon Law School , and Lewis & Clark Law School , use the visits as educational tools . = = Current justices = = Further information : List of Oregon Supreme Court Justices The court has had a total of 103 individuals serve on the court since its creation during the territorial period . This has ranged from a membership of three justices to seven justices . Since 1913 , the number of positions on the bench has been seven . Of the current membership , five are men and two are women . Overall , the court has had five women compared to ninety-four men serve on the court . Additionally , two current justices are the first two openly gay judges on the court . Thomas A. Balmer is the most senior of the seven justices , starting service in 2001 . The newest member of the court is Lynn Nakamoto , who joined the court in 2016 . Four of the seven justices first joined the court as appointees of the Governor of Oregon to fill mid-term vacancies . = = Notable Supreme Court cases = = Over the course of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number decisions as the highest court in Oregon . These cases cover a wide range of topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to contract law to torts and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory . Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided , some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court . Below are some of the cases that have had scholarly discussion , some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court .",

Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore , his role is largely ceremonial . It is the Cabinet , composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President , that generally directs and controls the Government . The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election . A statutory board is an autonomous agency of the Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry . Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries , statutory boards are not staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations . There are five Community Development Councils ( CDCs ) appointed by the board of management of the People 's Association ( PA ) for districts in Singapore . Where there are not less than 150,000 residents in a district , the PA 's board of management may designate the Chairman of a CDC to be the Mayor for the district that the CDC is appointed for . As it is the practice for MPs to be appointed as Chairmen of CDCs , these MPs have also been designated as Mayors . From the founding of modern Singapore in 1819 until 1826 , Singapore was headed by two Residents in succession . Following Singapore 's amalgamation into the Straits Settlements in 1826 , it was governed by a Governor together with a Legislative Council . An Executive Council of the Straits Settlements was introduced in 1877 to advise the Governor but wielded no executive power . In 1955 , a Council of Ministers was created , appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House . Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958 , and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959 . The Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara , who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly , and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister 's advice . In the 1959 general elections , the People 's Action Party ( PAP ) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly , and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore . The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore 's merger with Malaysia in 1963 , and subsequent independence in 1965 . The PAP has been returned to power in every general election and has thus formed the Cabinet since 1959 . The Government is generally perceived to be competent in managing the country 's economy and largely free from political corruption . On the other hand , it has been criticized for using unfair election tactics and violating freedom of speech . = = Terminology = = The term Government of Singapore can have a number of different meanings . At its widest , it can refer collectively to the three traditional branches of government \u2013 the Executive branch , Legislative branch ( the President and Parliament of Singapore ) and Judicial branch ( the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts of Singapore ) . The term is also used colloquially to mean the Executive and Legislature together , as these are the branches of government responsible for day-to-day governance of the nation and lawmaking . At its narrowest , the term is used to refer to the Members of Parliament ( MPs ) belonging to a particular political party ( or coalition of parties ) holding a majority of seats in Parliament sufficient to enable the party ( or coalition ) to form the Cabinet of Singapore \u2013 this is the sense intended when it is said that a political party \" forms the Government \" . The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore uses the word Government to mean the Executive branch , made up of the President and the Cabinet . This article describes the Government of Singapore in this technical sense , as well as selected aspects of the Executive branch of the Government . = = History = = On 30 January 1819 Sir Stamford Raffles , an Englishman who was the Governor of Bencoolen ( now Bengkulu , Indonesia ) , entered into a preliminary agreement with the Temenggung of Johor , Abdul Rahman Sri Maharajah , for the British East India Company to establish a \" factory \" or trading post on the island of Singapore . This was confirmed by another agreement signed by Raffles , the Temenggung and Sultan Hussein Shah on 6 February . In June 1823 Singapore ceased to be a dependency of Bencoolen and was placed under the control of the Presidency City of Calcutta ( Kolkata ) in the Bengal Presidency . On 24 June 1824 , Singapore and Malacca were formally transferred to the East India Company , with the result that they came under the control of Fort William . Full cession of Singapore to the Company by the Sultan and Temenggung was effected by a treaty of 19 November 1824 , which was ratified by Calcutta on 4 March 1825 . Between 1819 and 1826 , Singapore was headed by two Residents of Singapore in succession , Maj.-Gen. William Farquhar and Dr. John Crawfurd . In 1826 , Malacca , Penang and Singapore were amalgamated into the Straits Settlements , which were made a Crown colony with effect from 1 April 1867 . The Colony was governed by a Governor together with a Legislative Council . An Executive Council was introduced in 1877 by letters patent issued by the Crown , Composed of \" such persons and constituted in such manner as may be directed \" by royal instructions , it existed to advise the Governor and wielded no executive power . The Governor was required to consult the Executive Council on all affairs of importance unless they were too urgent to be laid before it , or if reference to it would prejudice the public service . In such urgent cases , the Governor had to inform the Council of the measures he had taken . Following the Second World War , the Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore became a Crown colony in its own right . The reconstituted Executive Council consisted of six officials and four nominated \" unofficials \" . In February 1954 , the Rendel Constitutional Commission under the chairmanship of Sir George William Rendel , which had been appointed to comprehensively review the constitution of the Colony of Singapore , rendered its report . Among other things , it recommended that a Council of Ministers be created , composed of three ex officio Official Members and six Elected Members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House , who would be the leader of the largest political party or coalition of parties having majority support in the legislature . The recommendation was implemented in 1955 . In the general election held that year , the Labour Front took a majority of the seats in the Assembly , and David Saul Marshall became the first Chief Minister of Singapore . Major problems with the Rendel Constitution were that the Chief Minister and Ministers ' powers were ill defined , and that the Official Members retained control of the finance , administration , and internal security and law portfolios . This led to confrontation between Marshall , who saw himself as a Prime Minister governing the country , and the Governor , Sir John Fearns Nicoll , who felt that important decisions and policies should remain with himself and the Official Members . In 1956 , members of the Legislative Assembly held constitutional talks with the Colonial Office in London . The talks broke down as Marshall did not agree to the British Government 's proposal for the casting vote on a proposed Defence Council to be held by the British High Commissioner to Singapore , who would only exercise it in an emergency . Marshall resigned as Chief Minister in June 1956 , and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock . The following year , Lim led another delegation to the UK for further talks on self-government . This time , agreement was reached on the composition of an Internal Security Council . Other constitutional arrangements were swiftly settled in 1958 , and on 1 August the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the State of Singapore Act 1958 , granting the colony full internal self-government . Under Singapore 's new constitution which came into force on 3 June 1959 , the Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara ( Head of State ) , who had power to appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Legislative Assembly , and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister 's advice . The Constitution also created the post of the British High Commissioner , who was entitled to receive the agenda of each Cabinet meeting and to see all Cabinet papers . In the 1959 general elections , the People 's Action Party ( PAP ) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly , and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore . Nine other Ministers were appointed to the Cabinet . The British High Commissioner 's role became that of an ambassador following Singapore 's independence from Britain and merger with Malaysia in 1963 . Apart from that , the executive branch of the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged , although now it governed a state within a larger federation . However , with effect from 9 August 1965 , Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became a fully independent republic . On separation from Malaysia , the Singapore Government retained the executive authority it held , and took on additional executive authority over Singapore that the Parliament of Malaysia relinquished . The Yang di-Pertuan Agong , the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia , also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty , jurisdiction , power and authority , executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore , which was revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore . The Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 then vested the executive authority of Singapore in the newly created post of President , and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet . The PAP has been repeatedly returned to power by voters and has thus formed the Cabinet since Singapore 's 1959 general election . The Government is generally perceived to be competent in managing the country 's economy , and largely free from political corruption . Transparency International 's 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index , which compares countries according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians , ranked Singapore in joint first place with Denmark and New Zealand out of 178 countries . In addition , Singapore was second only to New Zealand in the Asia-Pacific region . On the other hand , the Government has been criticized for using unfair election tactics , such as discouraging voting for opposition parties in the 2006 general election by stating that wards that elect opposition candidates will receive state-subsidized improvements to public housing only after all PAP-held wards have been attended to . It has also been accused of violating freedom of speech through Ministers bringing defamation suits against opposition politicians , and by restricting the circulation of foreign newspapers deemed to have engaged in domestic politics . = = Composition = = The Constitution defines the Government of Singapore as the President and the Cabinet of Singapore . The executive authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him or by the Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet . However , the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role in the executive branch of government . Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore , he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet . It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government . As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government , the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet . At the start of each new Parliamentary session , the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session . Each parliament lasts for a maximum of five years from the date of its first sitting , and once a parliament has been dissolved a general election must be held within three months . Following a general election , the President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who , in his judgment , is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the MPs . In practice , the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament . The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs , acting in accordance with the Prime Minister 's advice . = = = Ministries and responsibilities of Ministers = = = The Prime Minister may , by giving written directions , charge any Minister with responsibility for any department or subject . In practice , this is done by issuing notifications that are published in the Government Gazette . For instance , the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Responsibility of Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security , Prime Minister 's Office ) Notification 2009 states : It is hereby notified for general information that , pursuant to Article 30 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore , the Prime Minister has directed that Mr S. Jayakumar shall , with effect from 1st April 2009 , be charged with the responsibility for the following matters : ( a ) national security issues involving or affecting more than one Ministry ; ( b ) Chairmanship of the Security Policy Review Committee ; ( c ) foreign policy issues involving or affecting more than one Ministry ; and ( d ) foreign policy issues which involve legal negotiation or international adjudication , and that he shall be designated as Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security . Ministers may be designated by the Prime Minister to be in charge of particular ministries , or as Ministers in the Prime Minister 's Office . Such Ministers were formerly known as Ministers without portfolio . The Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge . Some Ministers are appointed as Second Ministers for portfolios other than their own to assist the primary Minister in his or her duties . For instance , with effect from 1 April 2009 during the 11th Parliament , Lim Hwee Hua , who was a Minister in the Prime Minister 's Office , also held the posts of Second Minister for Finance and Second Minister for Transport . On 31 July 2012 , the Prime Minister announced that , as of 1 November 2012 , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports ( MCYS ) and the Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts ( MICA ) would be reorganized into three ministries : the Ministry of Communications and Information ( MCI ) ; the Ministry of Culture , Community and Youth ( MCCY ) ; and the Ministry of Social and Family Development ( MSF ) . Thus , the ministries of the Government as of that date are the following : Prime Minister 's Office ( PMO ) Ministry of Communications and Information ( MCI ) Ministry of Culture , Community and Youth ( MCCY ) Ministry of Defence ( MINDEF ) Ministry of Education ( MOE ) Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources ( MEWR ) Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MFA ) Ministry of Health ( MOH ) Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ) Ministry of Law ( MinLaw ) Ministry of Manpower ( MOM ) Ministry of National Development ( MND ) Ministry of Social and Family Development ( MSF ) Ministry of Trade and Industry ( MTI ) Ministry of Transport ( MOT ) A ministry is usually composed of a headquarters and a number of departments , boards or other subordinate entities , and statutory boards . For instance , as of May 2007 the Ministry of Law had three departments ( the Chief Information Officer 's Office , Insolvency and Public Trustee 's Office and Legal Aid Bureau ) , three boards and tribunals ( the Appeals Board for Land Acquisitions , Copyright Tribunal and Land Surveyors Board ) , and two statutory boards ( the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and Singapore Land Authority ) . The names in bold are the surnames of Chinese persons , and the personal names of Indian and Malay persons ( except for Vivian Balakrishnan and Tharman Shanmugaratnam , where they indicate surnames as well ) .

In addition , the Constitution provides that the President , acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister , may appoint Parliamentary Secretaries from among the MPs to assist Ministers in the discharge of their duties and functions . Such office holders are not regarded as members of the Cabinet . Where in any written law a Minister is empowered to exercise any power or perform any duty , he may , in the absence of any provision of law to the contrary , with the approval of the President and by notification in the Government Gazette , depute any person by name or the person for the time being discharging the duties of an office designated by him to exercise that power or perform that duty on behalf of the Minister subject to such conditions , exceptions and qualifications as the President may determine . For instance , under the Delegation of Powers ( Ministry of Law ) ( Consolidation ) Notification , the Senior Minister of State for Law is deputed to exercise certain powers of the Minister for Law under the Copyright Act , Criminal Procedure Code , Land Acquisition Act , Land Surveyors Act , and Pawnbrokers Act ; while the Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs is deputed the powers of the Minister for Home Affairs under regulation 157 of the Prisons Regulations pursuant to the Delegation of Powers ( Ministry of Home Affairs ) ( Consolidation ) Notification . Template : Fourth Lee Hsien Loong Cabinet / Current Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries = = = Statutory boards = = = A statutory board is an autonomous agency of the Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry . The Act sets out the purposes , powers and rights of the agency . Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries , statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations . They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen , professionals , senior civil servants and officials of trade unions . The Agency for Science , Technology and Research ( A * STAR ) , the Central Provident Fund Board ( CPF ) , the Housing and Development Board ( HDB ) , the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore ( IPOS ) , the Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) , the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore ( MPA ) , the National Heritage Board ( NHB ) , and the Urban Redevelopment Authority ( URA ) are all statutory boards . The National Heritage Board is an example of a typical statutory board . It was established on 1 August 1993 with the enactment of the National Heritage Board Act . Section 3 of the Act states : \" There shall be established a body to be known as the National Heritage Board which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and shall , by that name , be capable of \u2014 ( a ) suing and being sued ; ( b ) acquiring , owning , holding , developing and disposing of property , both movable and immovable ; and ( c ) doing and suffering all such acts or things as bodies corporate may lawfully do or suffer . \" The functions of the Board are : to explore and present the heritage and nationhood of the people of Singapore in the context of their ancestral cultures , their links with South-East Asia , Asia and the world through the collection , preservation , interpretation and display of objects and records ; to promote public awareness , appreciation and understanding of the arts , culture and heritage , both by means of the Board \u2019 s collections and by such other means as it considers appropriate ; to promote the establishment and development of organizations concerned with the national heritage of Singapore ; to provide a permanent repository of records of national or historical significance and to facilitate access thereto ; to conduct records management programmes for the Government ; to record , preserve and disseminate the history of Singapore through oral history methodology or other means ; and to advise the Government in respect of matters relating to the national heritage of Singapore . The Board is empowered to \" do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions \" . Without prejudice to the generality of that provision , the Board also has power to , for example , develop and manage museums , archives , oral history centres and other facilities related to its functions ; to advise and facilitate the preservation of historic sites ; and to establish liaison with other museums , archives , oral history centres , universities and other institutions to secure maximum collaboration of all activities relevant to its functions . The Board consists of a Chairman , a Deputy Chairman , and not less than 10 nor more than 25 other members as the Minister for Information , Communications and the Arts may from time to time determine . The members of the Board are appointed by the Minister , and hold office for such term as the Minister may determine unless they resign during their term of office or their appointment is revoked by the Minister . The Minister is not required to provide any reason for revoking the appointment of a board member . The Minister may , in consultation with the Board or otherwise , give the Board directions as he thinks fit that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act concerning the exercise and performance by the Board of its functions , and the Board is required to give effect to such directions . With the approval of the Minister , the Board is required to appoint a chief executive officer who is responsible to the Board for the proper administration and management of the Board 's affairs in accordance with the policy laid down by the Board . The Board is entitled to appoint employees and officers on such terms as to remuneration or otherwise as it may determine , and to engage other persons and pay for their services as it considers necessary for carrying out its functions and duties . = = = Community Development Councils and Mayors of districts = = = The People 's Association ( PA ) is a statutory board , the objects of which include the organisation and the promotion of group participation in social , cultural , educational and athletic activities for the people of Singapore in order that they may realize that they belong to a multiracial community , the interests of which transcend sectional loyalties ; and the establishment of institutions for the purpose of leadership training in order to instill in leaders a sense of national identity and a spirit of dedicated service to a multiracial community . There are five Community Development Councils ( CDCs ) appointed by the board of management of the PA for districts in Singapore , namely , the Central Singapore CDC , North East CDC , North West CDC , South East CDC and South West CDC . The functions of a CDC include fostering community bonding and strengthening social cohesion amongst the people of Singapore ; and advising the PA on matters affecting the well-being of residents in districts , the provision and use of public facilities and services within districts , and the use of public funds allocated to districts for community activities . Each CDC consists of a Chairman and between 12 and 80 other members . Where the number of residents in a district is not less than 150,000 , the PA 's board of management is empowered to designate the Chairman of a CDC to be the Mayor for the district that the CDC is appointed for . As it is the practice for MPs to be appointed as Chairmen of CDCs , these MPs have also been designated as Mayors . As of 1 October 2015 , the Mayors are : The names in bold are the surnames of Chinese persons , and the personal names of Indian and Malay persons . Even if Mayors are required to vacate their seats in Parliament because Parliament has been dissolved or otherwise , they continue to hold office until their terms of office expire or they are directed to vacate their office by the PA 's board of management .",

Typically , this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament , or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively . Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom . The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are , subject to some exceptions , not effective in denying or restricting the extent to which the courts are able to exercise judicial review . In contrast , Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law , but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law . A partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period , after which no remedy will be available . Such clauses are generally effective , unless the public authority has acted in bad faith . Similarly , the existence of bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts . In the absence of bad faith , the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses . In general , subjectively worded powers are also viewed restrictively by the Singapore courts . In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal took the view that an objective test applied to the exercise of discretion conferred by the Internal Security Act ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) ( \" ISA \" ) on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs concerning the detention without trial of persons thought to be a risk to national security . Hence , the jurisdiction of the High Court was not completely ousted , and it could objectively examine whether the relevant decision-makers had exercised their powers properly . However , legislative amendments to the ISA in 1989 reversed the effect of Chng Suan Tze by mandating that the courts are to apply a subjective test to the exercise of the discretion , and by excluding judicial review except where there is doubt whether the procedures set out in the Act were adhered to . Nevertheless , the subjective test is only applicable in the context of the ISA , and the rule that an objective test applies to subjectively worded powers continues to apply where statutes other than the ISA are concerned . = = Total ouster or finality clauses = = An ouster clause in a statute is an attempt by the legislature to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts . Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage . One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause , which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court . The main legal issue with ouster clauses is whether it is in fact possible to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts by the use of carefully drafted provisions . Thio Li-ann has noted that \" courts generally loathe ouster clauses as these contradict the rule of law whereby judges finally declare the legal limits of power and also as the individual 's ultimate recourse to the law is denied . Hence , courts try to construe these strictly to minimise their impact . In so doing , they may be going against the grain of parliamentary will . \" Ouster clauses are related to another administrative law concept : jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law . Traditionally , at common law , an ouster clause precludes a court from interfering with a decision made by a public authority which was acting within its jurisdiction , but committed a non-jurisdictional error of law . However , the clause is not effective in preventing judicial review of errors of law that affect the jurisdiction of the authority to make the decision . For instance , in R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal , ex parte Gilmore ( 1957 ) , Lord Justice of Appeal Alfred Denning said that it was \" well settled that the remedy by certiorari is never to be taken away by any statute except by the most clear and explicit words . The word ' final ' is not enough . \" The effect of such a clause is to make \" the decision final on the facts , but not final on the law . Notwithstanding that the decision is by a statute made ' final , ' certiorari can still issue for excess of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record . \" However , in the light of developments in the law , such a differentiation may no longer be applicable depending on the judicial school of thought employed . = = = UK position = = = = = = = General rule = = = = The starting point for analysing ouster clauses and their effects is the landmark decision Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission ( 1968 ) . In that case , the House of Lords is regarded as having abolished the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law when it was considering the effect of an ouster clause . In Anisminic , their Lordships were faced with a provision which stated that \" the determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law \" . In his judgment , Lord Reid differentiated between the arguments put forth by the parties . He held that while the respondents had argued that the provision clearly denied the court the ability to question the determination made by the Foreign Compensation Commission , the question at hand did not even involve the questioning of the purported determination and instead focused on whether there was in fact a valid determination . He pointed out that \" if you seek to show that a determination is a nullity you are not questioning the purported determination \u2013 you are maintaining that it does not exist as a determination \" . He then held it was a well-established principle that a provision ousting the ordinary jurisdiction of the court must be construed strictly \u2013 if such a provision is reasonably capable of having two meanings , the meaning which preserves the ordinary jurisdiction of the court should be taken . If Parliament had intended to introduce a new kind of ouster clause that would protect such nullities from being questioned , better drafting of the provision would be required . In his judgment , Lord Reid also took the opportunity to deal with the issue of jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law . While recognizing the traditional understanding that jurisdictional errors of law are of no effect , his Lordship also stated that there are many cases where although the decision-maker has jurisdiction to decide , the determination is also a nullity . He then gave a non-exhaustive list of these cases : The decision-maker may have given its decision in bad faith . It may have made a decision which it had no power to make . It may have failed in the course of the inquiry to comply with the requirements of natural justice . It may , in perfect good faith , have misconstrued the provisions giving it power to act so that it failed to deal with the question remitted to it and decided some question which was not remitted to it . It may have refused to take into account something which it was required to take into account . It may have based its decision on some matter which , under the legal provisions establishing the decision-maker , it had no right to take into account . However , what is of significance is that his Lordship did not expressly reject the effectiveness of such ouster clauses where the decision is valid . He recognized that \" [ u ] ndoubtedly such a provision protects every determination which is not a nullity \" . Peter Cane has written that Lord Reid thus affirmed that \" the ouster clause in question would be effective to prevent the award of a judicial review remedy only if the error of law was within jurisdiction \" . However , it appears that Anisminic had defined the concept of jurisdictional error of law so broadly that it had made redundant the old divide between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors and had \" led to the use of the word ' jurisdictional ' in a wide sense to cover all errors of law which entailed illegality \" . The judgment thus had the effect of reducing the effect of statutory ouster clauses and expanding the limits of judicial review . Later cases have treated Anisminic as implying that any action committed in error by an administrative agency or body is deemed to affect the jurisdiction of the body to carry out the action , and hence is reviewable by a court of law despite the ouster clause . The blurred distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law was recognized and discussed in R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council , ex parte Page ( 1992 ) . The House of Lords reviewed the development of general principles of judicial review since Anisminic and concluded that the courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision-making bodies are exercised lawfully . In his judgment , Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred to O 'Reilly v. Mackman ( 1983 ) and opined that \" the decision in [ Anisminic ] rendered obsolete the distinction between errors of law on the face of the record and other errors of law by extending the doctrine of ultra vires . \" Thus , an ouster clause is ineffective when the decision-maker has acted unlawfully , whether the unlawfulness is jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional in nature . This is because \" Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis : a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires \" . The issue was revisited in the subsequent case of R. ( on the application of Cart ) v. Upper Tribunal ( 2011 ) . The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom disapproved of certain pronouncements by the lower courts which appeared to signal a return to the pre-Anisminic position . According to Lord Dyson , this was not justified as \" the importance of Anisminic is that it showed that a material error of law renders a decision a ' nullity ' so that the decision is in principle judicially reviewable \" . He went on to state that \" as a matter of principle , there is no justification for drawing the line at jurisdictional error \" . In his opinion , any restrictions on judicial review require justification and , prima facie , such review should be available to challenge the legality of decisions of public bodies . = = = = Exceptions = = = = = = = = = Decisions under domestic laws ; court decisions = = = = = Despite the extensiveness of the ruling in Anisminic , it appears that there may be instances where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide . Cane has noted that there are three views . The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant , while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction . The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view . This middle ground approach was discussed in ex parte Page when their Lordships dealt with whether the court can intervene and review a decision made by a visitor ( overseer ) of a university . Lord Browne-Wilkinson found that there were two reasons why the general rule that all errors of law are reviewable does not apply to visitors . First , the reason why courts can intervene in a normal case where the decision is considered ultra vires is because the law applicable to a decision made by such a body is the general law of the land . The visitor in ex parte Page did not apply the general law of the land but , rather , a \" domestic law \" ( the university 's charter and statutes ) of which he was the sole arbiter and over which the courts had no cognizance . Therefore , the visitor \" cannot err in law in reaching [ his ] decision since the general law is not the applicable law \" . Secondly , there is a difference between the kinds of tribunals the decisions of which are being considered for judicial review . The source of this reasoning is the dissenting judgment of Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane in Pearlman v. Keepers and Governors of Harrow School ( 1978 ) . Lord Browne-Wilkinson noted that this dissenting judgment was approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn . Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union ( 1980 ) , and also by a majority in Re Racal Communications Ltd . ( 1980 ) . In the latter case , Lord Diplock highlighted that the decision in Anisminic only applies to administrative bodies or tribunals as there is a presumption that Parliament does not intend such bodies to be the final arbiters of questions of law . This can be contrasted with courts of law in respect of which such a presumption is not present . Instead , the presumption is that \" where Parliament had provided that the decision of an inferior court was final and conclusive the High Court should not be astute to find that the inferior court 's decision on a question of law had not been made final and conclusive , thereby excluding the jurisdiction to review it . \" The views expressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson have been questioned by Cane . As regards the first reason , he has argued that the distinction between domestic law and general law is problematic . Such institutions may actually operate under a statutory framework which can result in a mixed issue of both general and domestic law arising . As such , the view taken by Lord Browne-Wilkinson cannot be as cleanly applied as he had described it to be . Moreover , the actual scope of ex parte Page has yet to be resolved . There is some uncertainty as to the extent the exception applies to decision-makers other than visitors . Where the second reason is concerned , Cane has noted that the correctness of the distinction between administrative tribunals and courts may be questionable as such an approach was \" rejected by a Divisional Court and , apparently , by Lord Diplock himself . \" = = = = = Comprehensive tribunal system to correct errors of law = = = = = Another exception can be found in the Cart judgment . Having affirmed the position taken in Anisminic , Lord Dyson then qualified his statement by emphasizing that \" the scope of judicial review should be no more ( as well as no less ) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law \" . On the facts of the case , he found it was neither proportionate nor necessary for the maintenance of the rule of law to require unrestricted judicial review . By enacting the Tribunals , Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 , Parliament had rationalized the system of administrative tribunals and had created the Upper Tribunal to hear appeals from lower tribunals , thus avoiding the ordinary courts from being overwhelmed by judicial review applications . As the system of tribunals provided ample opportunity for the correction of errors of law , this substantive policy reason precluded the need for all decisions of the Upper Tribunal to be subject to judicial review . Thus , judicial review would only be permitted from an Upper Tribunal decision if it would \" raise some important point of principle or practice \" or there was \" some other compelling reason \" . = = = Singapore position = = = The High Court case of Re Application by Yee Yut Ee ( 1978 ) suggests that the pre-Anisminic position on ouster clauses applies in Singapore ; that is , the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law persists , and an ouster clause is only ineffective where a jurisdictional error of law has been committed . The ouster clause in question was section 46 of the Industrial Relations Act which states : Subject to the provisions of this Act an award shall be final and conclusive , and no award or decision or order of a Court or the President or a referee shall be challenged , appealed against , reviewed , quashed , or called in question in any court and shall not be subject to certiorari , prohibition , mandamus or injunction in any court on any account . The Court neither expressly rejected nor affirmed the abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses . Instead , the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction on the part of the decision-maker , a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic . The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all . Ultimately , the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction . In Stansfield Business International Pte . Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower ( 1999 ) , an employee fired for incompetence accused the plaintiff company of unfair dismissal and made representations to the Minister for Manpower under section 14 of the Employment Act to be reinstated . After investigating this claim , the Ministry came to the conclusion that the dismissal was made without just cause and recommended payment to the employee . Although section 14 ( 5 ) of the Employment Act provides that \" the decision of the Minister on any representation made under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be challenged in any court \" , the company applied for judicial review against the Minister 's decision . The High Court held that the ouster clause in section 14 ( 5 ) of the Employment Act was ineffective as there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice in the process by which the Minister 's decision was reached . In his judgment , Justice Warren L. H. Khoo stated that the \" broad principle \" in Anisminic governing the matter had been restated in the case of South East Asia Fire Bricks as follows : [ W ] hen words in a statute oust the power of the High Court to review decisions of an inferior tribunal by certiorari , they must be construed strictly ... they will not have the effect of ousting that power if the inferior tribunal has acted without jurisdiction or \" if it has done or failed to do something in the course of the inquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity \" : per Lord Reid at p . 171 [ of Anisminic ] . But if the inferior tribunal has merely made an error of law which does not affect its jurisdiction , and if its decision is not a nullity for some reason such as breach of the rules of natural justice , then the ouster will be effective . In a 2010 lecture to students of the Singapore Management University School of Law , Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong briefly discussed the decision in Stansfield . He pointed out that Justice Khoo 's statements on Anisminic were obiter dicta because the decision had been \" based on a breach of natural justice and not the doctrine of error of law \" . He also considered an academic argument that an ouster clause may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Singapore Constitution which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts . Chief Justice Chan stated that if this proposition was answered in the affirmative , it would follow that the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts cannot be ousted , and there would thus be no need for Singapore courts to draw the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law . Nevertheless , he highlighted the fact that he was not expressing an opinion on the issue . = = Partial ouster or time limit clauses = = Unlike a total ouster or finality clause which seeks to preclude judicial review entirely , a partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available . Such clauses are generally effective , unless the public authority has acted in bad faith , in which case the decision impugned may be subject to judicial review even though the time permitted for challenging it has lapsed . In Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council ( 1956 ) , the House of Lords concluded by a majority that they could not impugn a partial ouster clause because , according to Viscount Simonds , \" plain words must be given their plain meaning \" , even though fraud on the part of the public authority had been alleged . In contrast , Lord Reid gave a dissenting opinion in which he doubted whether an order that had been obtained by corrupt or fraudulent means could be protected from being questioned in court . Despite the subsequent ruling in Anisminic , in R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment , ex parte Ostler ( 1976 ) the Court of Appeal of England and Wales applied Smith and upheld the validity of a partial ouster clause that gave the applicants six weeks to challenge a decision . Lord Denning , the Master of the Rolls , explained that upholding partial ouster clauses promoted the certainty of the executive 's actions . It would not be in the public interest if applicants could challenge decisions after the time limit for doing so had expired , as this would delay actions taken by the executive . As Lord Justice of Appeal Michael Mann put it in R. v. Cornwall County Council , ex parte Huntington ( 1992 ) : The intention of Parliament when it uses an Anisminic clause is that questions as to validity are not excluded . When paragraphs such as those considered in ex p . Ostler are used , then the legislative intention is that questions as to invalidity may be raised on the specified grounds in the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner , but that otherwise the jurisdiction of the court is excluded in the interest of certainty . = = Conclusive evidence clauses = = Provisions in statutes declaring that certain decisions by public authorities shall be conclusive evidence of some facts have been found by the Singapore courts to be valid , and therefore have the effect of preventing applicants from challenging most \u2013 but not all \u2013 of such decisions by way of judicial review . In Galstaun v. Attorney-General ( 1980 ) , the applicant alleged that the Collector of Land Revenue had compulsorily acquired more of his land that was required for public purposes pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act . The High Court held that the argument had to be rejected in the light of section 5 ( 3 ) of the Act , which provided that the President 's declaration that land was needed for a public purpose \" shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for the purpose specified therein \" . The Court said : \" When the Government declares that a certain purpose is a public purpose it must be presumed that the Government is in possession of facts which induce the Government to declare that the purpose is a public purpose \" . However , in Teng Fuh Holdings Pte . Ltd. v. Collector of Land Revenue ( 2006 ) , the Court clarified that section 5 ( 3 ) cannot prevent judicial intervention if there is evidence that the Government exercised its power of compulsory acquisition in bad faith . = = Subjectively worded powers = = Another method employed by the legislature to restrict judicial review by the courts is to cast statutory language in a subjective form . A subjectively worded power suggests that the discretion to exercise this power rests entirely with the minister , statutory body or agency referred to , in which case the view might be taken that a court should not query how the power has been exercised . Examples of subjectively worded powers include powers that are stated to be exercisable \" if the Minister so directs \" or \" as the Minister thinks fit \" . However , as with ouster clauses , courts have traditionally displayed resistance to such provisions . In practice , they are subject to the normal grounds of judicial review set forth in the UK case Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( \" the GCHQ case \" , 1983 ) ; in other words , the exercise of power may be invalidated if determined to be illegal , irrational or procedurally improper . = = = In the Internal Security Act = = = = = = = Subjective or objective test ? = = = = Section 8 ( 1 ) of the Internal Security Act ( \" ISA \" ) empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to detain a person without trial if the President \" is satisfied \" that this step is necessary because the person is , among other things , a threat to national security . Section 10 of the Act states that the Minister can direct that a detention order be suspended subject to conditions \" as the Minister sees fit \" , and can also revoke such a direction \" if he is satisfied \" that the detainee failed to observe any condition or if it is necessary in the public interest to do so . In the seminal Court of Appeal decision Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the respondents submitted that the President 's discretion under section 8 ( 1 ) was subjective , and so was not open to review by the courts . The appellants argued that the discretion was objective , and thus a court of law could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised . The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10 , and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review . In coming to this decision , it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision , Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs , which had held to the contrary . While the Court 's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter , later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach . It gave several reasons for its decision . First , the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable , and , secondly , such a test was inconsistent with Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution . Finally , the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary to the rule of law and all powers had legal limits . = = = = 1989 legislative intervention = = = = On 25 January 1989 , the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 and the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 were passed by Parliament to confirm the applicability of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive 's discretionary powers under the ISA . These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively . Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill , Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts ' application of an objective test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive 's functions in matters pertaining to national security , which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with . Its stance was that the objective test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine . Moreover , the judicial process , unlike executive decision-making , was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats . The courts , unlike the executive , lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters , and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive . Furthermore , the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions . Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore 's local conditions , the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA . Jayakumar said that while the Government recognized that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA , the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts to impair this judicial check . Instead , the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power . The amendments to the Constitution paved the way for intended amendments to the ISA . The new Article 149 ( 3 ) stated that if the issue of the validity of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister for Home Affairs arose in any court proceedings commenced before or after 27 January 1989 , it was to be determined in accordance with any law enacted by Parliament for this purpose , and Article 93 of the Constitution could not be relied upon to invalidate such a law . Pursuant to Article 149 ( 3 ) , Parliament then inserted new sections into the ISA . In particular , section 8B ( 1 ) confirmed the judgment in Lee Mau Seng by declaring that \" the law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the provisions of this Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971 ; and no part of the law before , on or after that date of any other country in the Commonwealth relating to judicial review shall apply \" . In addition , section 8B ( 1 ) was made subject to section 8B ( 2 ) , which seeks to oust judicial review in any court of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister under the ISA , save where there is any question which relates to compliance with any procedural requirement of the ISA governing such acts or decisions . Jayakumar said in Parliament that section 8B ( 2 ) sought not only to prevent the courts from questioning the soundness of the subjective test , but also to anticipate any legal challenges on the basis that the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng only applies to the judicial review of detention orders and not to other acts or decisions under the ISA by the President or Minister , such as suspension directions and revocations of such directions . = = = = Operation of subjectively worded powers in the ISA after the 1989 amendments = = = = The 1989 amendments to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1989 ) . Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B ( 1 ) and 8B ( 2 ) of the ISA govern judicial review in the context of that Act , and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze . Therefore , applying the subjective test , the respondents ' burden of justifying the legality of the applicant 's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President , acting on the advice of the Cabinet , that the applicant was a risk to national security . The applicant then appealed to the Court of Appeal . The Court of Appeal construed section 8B ( 1 ) in accordance with the clear legislative intention expressed through the plain wording of the provision . It held that the provision reinstates the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of decisions made or acts done pursuant to the executive 's powers under the ISA . In order to determine the law on judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA , it is necessary to ascertain the exact decision laid down in Lee Mau Seng . However , the Court declined to opine whether the Lee Mau Seng decision meant that a detention order cannot be challenged on the basis that it was made for reasons completely outside the scope of the ISA . This was because on the facts of the case it had not been established that the applicant was re-detained for reasons not contemplated by section 8 ( 1 ) of the ISA and completely unrelated to national security . Notably , the Court did not decide whether section 8B ( 2 ) of the ISA precludes it from reviewing a detention order shown to have been made for purposes other than national security , or whether the 1989 amendments to the ISA are outside the scope of the legislative power conferred on Parliament by the amended Article 149 of the Constitution . = = = In other statutes = = = Due to the 1989 amendments to the Constitution and the ISA , the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts , except when there has been some non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act . On the other hand , the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA . In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General ( 2011 ) , the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze . Apart from restricting the courts ' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety , Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion \u2013 that is , power without legal limits \u2013 is contrary to the rule of law , which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power . Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze , it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle . In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1992 ) , the statutory provision in question was section 30 of the Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions ) Act ( \" CLTPA \" ) , which states as follows : Whenever the Minister [ of Home Affairs ] is satisfied with respect to any person , whether the person is at large or in custody , that the person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature , the Minister may , with the consent of the Public Prosecutor \u2014 ( a ) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be detained in the interests of public safety , peace and good order , by order under his hand direct that the person be detained for any period not exceeding 12 months from the date of the order ; or ( b ) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be subject to the supervision of the police , by order direct that the person be subject to the supervision of the police for any period not exceeding 3 years from the date of the order . [ Emphasis added . ] The Court of Appeal suggested that , in the light of Chng Suan Tze , the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister . Moreover , in Re Wong Sin Yee ( 2007 ) , which also involved judicial review of an applicant 's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA , the High Court , following the decision in Chng Suan Tze , held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review as regards the exercise of the Minister 's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review . The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30 ; if it Court had applied a subjective test , it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety , peace and good order . = = = Cases = = = Anisminic Ltd. v.

                    "text": "Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore = Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore guarantees to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law . The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications \u2013 religion , race , descent and place of birth \u2013 upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons . For example , discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . Persons unable to show that one of the forbidden classifications applies to them may try to argue that they are members of a group defined by a law in a way that violates the general guarantee of equality and equal protection . To succeed , they must establish that the classification used in the law fails the rational nexus test , which is a three-stage test formulated by the courts . The first stage of the test involves an examination as to whether the law differentiates amongst classes of individuals . At the second stage , the court considers if the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia or distinguishing feature . Finally , the basis of the differentiation must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . However , the test is not foolproof as a classification may satisfy the test even if the object of the law is itself illegitimate . The rational nexus test , as it is currently applied in Singapore , also tolerates over- and under-inclusive classifications . It remains to be seen if local courts will consider other approaches to the issue , such as the three-tier system of scrutiny applied in the United States , the proportionality analysis applied in the United Kingdom to other areas of human rights law , or the reasonableness approach taken by some judges in India and Malaysia . The rational nexus test does not apply where a statute treats all persons equally , but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner . Instead , a modified rational nexus test is used , which requires a court to consider whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law . Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination . It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency , unless this occurs on a very substantial scale . In addition , inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . = = Text of Article 12 = = Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is entitled \" Equal protection \" and reads as follows : 12 . \u2014 ( 1 ) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law . ( 2 ) Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution , there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition , holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . ( 3 ) This Article does not invalidate or prohibit \u2014 ( a ) any provision regulating personal law ; or ( b ) any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . In the 1998 decision Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong , the Court of Appeal regarded the concept of equality as a component of the wider doctrine of the rule of law , and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states : \" To none will we sell , to none will we deny , to none will we delay right or justice . \" Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying \" to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws \" , and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying \" to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India \" . Article 12 ( 1 ) is identical to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of Malaysia , from which it was adopted following Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 . In Lim Meng Suang v. Attorney-General ( 2013 ) , the High Court noted that the concept of equality before the law is derived from English common law which requires all classes of persons to be equally subject to the law , while the concept of equal protection of the law stems from the US Constitution 's Fourteenth Amendment and guarantees both procedural and substantive equality . The Court said : It will be seen that equality before the law and equal protection of the law are but different aspects of the same doctrine \u2013 equal justice . The first expresses the immutable principle of equal subjection of all classes of persons to the law , and the second is the positive aspect of that principle which reaches out , when invoked , to strike down unequal laws and discriminatory administrative or executive action as unconstitutional and void . = = Discriminatory classification = = = = = Forbidden classifications = = = Article 12 ( 2 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against Singapore citizens ( unlike Article 12 ( 1 ) which applies to \" all persons \" ) \" on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth \" in the following situations : In any law . In the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority . In the administration of any law relating to ( 1 ) the acquisition , holding or disposition of property ; or ( 2 ) the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . The word only raises the possibility that discrimination may be permissible on the basis of one of the proscribed grounds in combination with some other factor , such as age or state of health . Article 12 ( 2 ) is subject to an express contrary authorization by the Constitution . Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure that members of the Malay , Indian and other minority communities are represented in Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) . Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates , at least one of whom must be from a minority community . Article 39A ( 3 ) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12 . Another provision that is rescued from potential invalidity by Article 12 ( 2 ) is the Government 's constitutional mandate to exercise its functions in such a way as to recognize the special position of the Malays , who are the indigenous people of Singapore . The Government has a responsibility to \" protect , safeguard , support , foster and promote their political , educational , religious , economic , social and cultural interests and the Malay language \" . The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate Muslim religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the President concerning matters relating to Islam . The legislation in question is the Administration of Muslim Law Act . = = = Other discriminatory classifications : the rational nexus test = = = Aggrieved persons who cannot avail themselves of the protection afforded by Article 12 ( 2 ) may try to argue that they are a member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . The rational nexus test , also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification , is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory . The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept ; it does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Consequently , a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances , and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law . If there is no such relationship , the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid . = = = = History = = = = In 1909 , the Supreme Court of the United States propounded a test to determine the reasonableness of a classification , stating that the classification \" must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made \" . Based on this principle , the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two-stage test to determine if a classification made by a law was constitutional . The relevant stages were ( 1 ) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia ; and ( 2 ) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question . The Federal Court of Malaysia later adapted the rational nexus test by including an additional preceding stage , namely , whether the law was discriminatory . This three-stage inquiry was accepted in Singapore in the case Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor ( 1996 ) . = = = = Stages of the test = = = = The test that is currently followed in Singapore was re-expressed by the Court of Appeal in Taw Cheng Kong ( 1998 ) as comprising three stages : Whether the law differentiates \u2013 that is , prescribes different treatment \u2013 amongst classes of individuals . Whether the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia ( distinguishing feature ) . Whether the basis of differentiation bears a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . The purpose of the test is to ensure that the right to equal protection is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness . First , individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily . Secondly , the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary . Lastly , the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action . The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness . As such , a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional . = = = = = Stage 1 : Whether the law differentiates = = = = = The first stage of the test considers whether the law prescribes different treatment for one group of individuals as against other groups . For example , in the 1998 High Court decision Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor , Judge of Appeal M. Karthigesu found that the Prevention of Corruption Act differentiated between classes of people as it renders some , but not all , persons open to criminal prosecution in Singapore for offences committed outside Singapore . While earlier cases expressed this stage of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory , the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination . A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people . A discriminatory law or executive act , on the other hand , is one that contravenes Article 12 ( 1 ) and hence is unconstitutional . Therefore , the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory , as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration . If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure , it is a good law and the objection fails . Even if a differentiating measure is found , there is a strong presumption that it is constitutional . The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy . Unless the law is plainly arbitrary , suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality . It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people , and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems , hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds . Therefore , to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily . = = = = = Stage 2 : Intelligible differentia = = = = = The second stage of the rational nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group . To satisfy the second stage , there must be a discernible basis of classification . All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against . Examples of such features include gender , age , race , religion , seniority of professional qualification and area of residence . Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship . Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself , but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects , does not constitute classification . If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently , the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid . If there is an intelligible differentia , the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage . Equality under Article 12 ( 1 ) does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Similarly , failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality . As such , at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally . Article 12 ( 1 ) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others . However , the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against , and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against . The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution , whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it . The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where all members of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally . = = = = = Stage 3 : Reasonable relation to statutory objective = = = = = In this stage , it is necessary to inquire into , firstly , the object of the statute , and secondly , whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object . The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable , taking into consideration the object of the statute , to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation . As such , it is necessary to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute . The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved , and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional . In Taw Cheng Kong , the respondent challenged his conviction for corruption on the ground that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act , which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens ( but not non-citizens ) occurring outside Singapore , discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act 's object , which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it . The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations . = = = = Criticisms of the test = = = = = = = = = Unreasonable legislative objectives = = = = = In equal protection cases , the purpose of the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged . When the purpose of the law is not explicitly stated , the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose , assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it , or draw some inferences as to what it is . When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated , the court may either accept it at face value ; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration , looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose . In the latter situation , what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation . The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the \" thornier aspects of judicial review \" , because it must either \" uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value \" or \" challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference \" . The court must then \" make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end \" . This step is necessary because the rational nexus test is not foolproof . The test is based on the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution . However , if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate , a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test . Hence , the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one . In India , a solution was proffered by means of a more holistic approach to the constitutional promise of equality . In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India ( 1978 ) , the learned Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati noted that \" an essential element of equality pervades Article 14 \" , the equivalent of Singapore 's Article 12 . With that as a starting point , he went on to assert that \" the procedure ... must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary \" . The judge in Maneka Gandhi therefore spoke for a dynamic approach to equality , one that should not be \" subjected to a narrow , pedantic or lexicographic approach \" . This more liberal approach , which accords courts the latitude to deal with legislation backed by arbitrary or unreasonable objectives , was cited with approval in Malaysia by the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram in Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan ( 1996 ) . It is unclear , though , if this test will be applied in Singapore due to a dearth of case law on the matter . = = = = = Over- and under-inclusiveness = = = = = Another problem encountered when applying the rational nexus test is that of over- and under-inclusiveness . Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law . On the other hand , over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective , but also persons outside it . Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test , as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires . It has been argued that this results in the different treatment of persons in like situations , and thus violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object , the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed . However , the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm , to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest , and to advance its policies step by step . Despite this , resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness , if used indiscriminately , may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12 ( 1 ) . Similarly , where an over-inclusive classification is concerned , a rational relation still exists between the differentia adopted and the legislative object . Thus , it is tolerated under the rational nexus test in Singapore . While the effect of an over-inclusive classification may be to accord similar treatment to persons differently placed , courts have nonetheless justified it on the ground that the exigencies of the situation require such classification . The US Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States ( 1943 ) is an example of this principle . Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring , among other things , all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be \" within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. \" and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area . The defendant , Gordon Hirabayashi , was convicted of violating the curfew and the registration requirement . The order was arguably over-inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty . Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens solely on the basis of ancestry \" are , by their very nature , odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality \" , because the US was at war with Japan the race-based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order , which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack . The Court said : \" We cannot close our eyes to the fact , demonstrated by experience , that , in time of war , residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry . \" In Taw Cheng Kong , the High Court was of the view that section 37 ( 1 ) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was both under- and over-inclusive . It did not apply to non-Singapore citizens such as permanent residents and foreigners working for the Government who received bribes for acts which would be done in Singapore . On the other hand , it would catch a Singapore citizen now a foreign permanent resident employed in a foreign country by a foreign government who received a bribe in relation to a transaction that had nothing to do with Singapore . For this reason , Karthigesu J. found section 37 ( 1 ) to be unconstitutional since the nexus between the classification and section 37 ( 1 ) ' s objective was not reasonable enough to justify derogating from Article 12 ( 1 ) . The High Court 's decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal , which held that the under-inclusiveness was not fatal because of the \" overriding need to observe international comity \" . In any case , \" [ t ] he enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency . Such a demand would be legislatively impractical , if not impossible . \" The over-inclusiveness of section 37 ( 1 ) was deemed irrelevant to the constitutional issue because the provision applied equally to all Singapore citizens . = = = = Applications of the rational nexus test = = = = The rational nexus test was applied in Mohamed Emran bin Mohamed Ali v. Public Prosecutor ( 2008 ) , in which the High Court was faced with the issue of whether the failure to prosecute drug enforcement authorities in an entrapment case amounted to discrimination against the persons eventually charged with drug trafficking . The Court found that there was a \" perfectly rational nexus between entrapment operations and the socially desirable and laudable objective of containing the drug trade \" as convicting state agents who carried out covert operations would result in illicit drug suppliers prospering and flourishing while enforcement agencies would \" wither and perish \" . Further , the exercise of the Attorney-General 's prosecutorial discretion was an executive act which satisfied the rational nexus test and was therefore not in contravention of Article 12 of the Constitution . In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor ( 2010 ) , the Court of Appeal had to determine the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes . In that case , the differentiating factor was found in the Misuse of Drugs Act ( \" MDA \" ) , which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than 15 grams ( 0.53 oz ) of diamorphine ( heroin ) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction . Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor ( 2005 ) , which had applied Ong Ah Chuan , the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA . The Court also noted that the \" quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market , but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and , hence , broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender 's crime . \" Although Taw Cheng Kong was not cited in this case , the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in Taw Cheng Kong . = = = = Alternatives to the rational nexus test = = = = In other jurisdictions , courts have applied standards of judicial review more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional . It remains to be seen whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally . = = = = = Three-tiered scrutiny = = = = = In footnote 4 of United States v. Carolene Products Co . ( 1938 ) , Justice Harlan F. Stone opined that where legislation was aimed at \" discrete and insular minorities \" who lack the normal protections of the political process , a more exacting standard of judicial review with no presumption of constitutionality should be applied . At present in the United States there are three different levels of scrutiny . Firstly , if a law categorizes on the basis of race or national origin ( which are regarded as suspect classifications ) , or infringes a fundamental right , strict scrutiny is applied . Accordingly , the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest . In addition , there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest . Secondly , if the law categorizes on the basis of gender , legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications , intermediate scrutiny is applied \u2013 the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest . Finally , the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other , non-suspect , basis . In this case , the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest . In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court of Malaysia referred to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not very different from the traditional rational nexus standard , which it then proceeded to apply . The Court 's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon ( 1990 ) . It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights , and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review . As such , the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia . There are several criticisms of the three-tiered scrutiny analysis , the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being that it does not control judicial discretion : the identification of classifications as suspect , quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests , and political and social interests . = = = = = Test of proportionality = = = = = The test of proportionality in English law , which is applied to determine whether a fundamental right is appropriately restricted by legislation , has three limbs : The legislative objective must be sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right . The measures designed to meet the legislative objective must be rationally connected to it . The means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective . It has been suggested that a proportionality analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three-tiered scrutiny approach . The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test . = = = = = Test of reasonableness = = = = = In Maneka Gandhi , Bhagwati J. appeared to suggest that the rational nexus test should not be applied to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution , which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law , because it led to a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision . He held that Article 14 should not be construed too narrowly as it was the pillar on which the foundation of the Indian Democratic Republic rested . In his view , the principle of reasonableness was an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness , and it pervaded Article 14 \" like a brooding omnipresence \" . A test of reasonableness was applied to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Malaysian Constitution in some cases , but it was later rejected by the Federal Court in Danaharta Urus Sdn . Bhd. v. Kekatong Sdn . Bhd . ( 2004 ) . The Court noted that in cases subsequent to Maneka Gandhi the reasonable classification test had been applied , even by Bhagwati J. himself . Furthermore , equality under Article 8 ( 1 ) does not mean absolute equality , but only assures the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances . The rational nexus test is needed to determine if a law applies equally to all persons in the same group , and is therefore an \" integral part \" of Article 8 ( 1 ) . = = Discriminatory application of laws = = The traditional Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test is inappropriate where the issue is not the existence of discriminatory classification in a statute , but discriminatory application of a neutral statute . This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test as the answer to whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons ( stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test ) will always be in the negative . In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General ( 2009 ) , Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang , delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal , applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test , holding that \" [ t ] he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law \" . Phang J.A. relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1980 ) and Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1990 ) , drawing the following salient points from them : An executive act may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination . Thus , an intentional systematic undervaluation of property would breach Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , though \" something less might perhaps suffice \" . However , absolute equality is not attainable and inequalities arising from \" the application of a reasonable administrative policy \" or \" mere errors of judgement \" are not sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . Inequalities due to \" inadvertence or inefficiency \" need to be on \" a very substantial scale \" to violate the Article . Thio Li-ann has expressed the view that Phang J.A. ' s approach in Eng Foong Ho leaves room for judicial clarification . An important question is whether the \" intentional and arbitrary discrimination \" test , which implies the lack of any rationality , is the sole test for proving that an executive act violates Article 12 , or only one possible test . If it is the only test , then the need to prove the absence of rationality is excessively onerous for the plaintiff to satisfy , compared to the \" reasonable classification \" test . She posits that it is preferable for both the \" intentional and arbitrary discrimination \" test and the \" reasonable classification \" test to apply to executive acts . = = Restrictions on the right to equality and equal protection = = Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . Personal law is the law governing a person 's family matters . In Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v. Fatimah binte Abud bin Talib ( 2009 ) , the High Court identified a number of personal laws , including the Intestate Succession Act which does not apply to Muslims ; and regulations 103 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the Prisons Regulations , which respectively state that Jewish prisoners can claim an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government , and that Muslim prisoners may fast during Ramadan and have their work reduced during this period . A number of private Acts establishing religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions . For instance , a person may only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board , which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments , if he or she is Hindu . Similarly , one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board , which manages gurdwaras ( Sikh temples ) in Singapore , if one professes the Sikh faith . Article 149 ( 1 ) immunizes the Internal Security Act from invalidity due to inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution , including Article 12 . The reference to Article 12 in Article 149 ( 1 ) was enacted by Parliament in 1989 to reverse the effect of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , in which the Court of Appeal expressed the view that sections 8 and 10 of the Act violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . = = Other constitutional provisions = = Article 16 ( 1 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in the administration of public educational institutions ( and , in particular , as regards the admission of students or the payment of fees ) , and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution . This provision is stated to be \" [ w ] ithout prejudice to the generality of Article 12 \" . Article 16 ( 2 ) declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions , but there must not be any discrimination on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws . Article 154 states that all persons who are in the same Government service grade must be treated impartially regardless of their race , subject to the terms and conditions of their employment and to other provisions of the Constitution . The Constitution also establishes a procedure for ensuring that statutes do not contain \" differentiating measures \" , that is , measures which discriminate against any racial or religious community . Most bills that have been passed by Parliament must be scrutinized by a non-elected advisory body called the Presidential Council for Minority Rights ( PCMR ) , which must report to the Speaker of Parliament if it is of the view that any clause in a bill contains a differentiating measure . If the PCMR submits an adverse report , Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval , or decide to present the bill for the President 's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all Members of Parliament . The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in 1970 . = = = Cases = = = Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [ 1978 ] INSC 16 , A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597 , Supreme Court ( India ) .

                    "text": "Davis v. Ayala = Davis v. Ayala , 576 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2015 ) was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a death sentence of a Hispanic defendant despite the fact that all Blacks and Hispanics were excluded from the jury during the defendant 's trial . The case involved a habeas corpus petition submitted by Hector Ayala , who was arrested and tried in the late 1980s for the alleged murder of three individuals during an attempted robbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego , California in April 1985 . At trial , the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service . The trial court judge allowed the prosecution to explain the basis for the peremptory challenges outside the presence of Ayala 's counsel , \" so as not to disclose trial strategy \" . Ayala was ultimately sentenced to death , but he filed several appeals challenging the constitutionality of the trial court 's decision to exclude his counsel from the hearings . In a 5 \u2013 4 opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito , the Supreme Court held that even if the trial court committed error , the error was harmless and that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice . Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that Ayala 's sentence should be reversed because the exclusion of Ayala 's counsel from the hearings \" substantially influenced the outcome \" of the case . Additionally , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of Ayala 's placement in solitary confinement . In response , Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a one-paragraph concurring opinion in which he stated that Ayala 's accommodations were \" far sight more spacious than those in which his victims ... now rest \" . Commentators have described the case as \" important \" and note that will likely have a \" significant effect \" on similar cases in the future . However , some analysts have described the outcome as \" particularly unjust \" . Justice Kennedy 's concurring opinion also received significant coverage from the media , and some analysts suggested that solitary confinement may become a \" new battleground \" for Justice Kennedy . One commentator described Justice Kennedy 's concurring opinion as \" the single most surprising and heartening development of the term \" . = = Legal Background = = = = = Batson challenges = = = In Batson v. Kentucky , the Supreme Court of the United States held that a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution occurs when prosecutors use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race . If a defendant alleges that a prosecutor challenged a prospective juror on the basis of that juror 's race ( a process known as a \" Batson challenge \" ) , trial courts will conduct a three-part analysis of the peremptory challenge in question : \" [ f ] irst , a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race ; second , if that showing has been made , the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question ; and third , in light of the parties \u2019 submissions , the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination . \" A court will only sustain a Batson challenge if all three elements of this test are satisfied . On appeal , a trial court 's findings with respect to a Batson challenge will only be reversed if a trial court judge committed clear error . Additionally , the Supreme Court of the United States has held that findings with respect to a prosecutor 's explanation of the reasons for their use of peremptory challenges is \" entitled to ' great deference ' \" . = = = The right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus under federal law = = = When individuals are convicted for crimes under state law , those individuals have the right to challenge the constitutionality of their convictions in federal court by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus . This right was codified by the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 , and in 1953 , the United States Supreme Court held that even when a state court rules against a prisoner , that individual still has the right to seek de novo review of their constitutional claims in federal court . However , in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing , congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act ( \" AEDPA \" ) in 1996 to modify federal habeas corpus procedures . Under the AEDPA 's new standards , when a prisoner 's claim has been adjudicated in state court , that individual 's petition for habeas corpus shall not be granted unless the state court decision \" was contrary to , or involved an unreasonable application of , clearly established Federal law , as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States \" . In 2007 , the United States Supreme Court held that , as a \" precondition \" for relief under the AEDPA , habeas petitioners must demonstrate evidence that a state court 's error resulted in \" actual prejudice \" . = = = Federal harmless error doctrine = = = The Supreme Court of the United States has identified a narrow range of errors that require automatic reversal ; for all other errors , the decision of a lower court will be upheld if the error was harmless . In 1967 , the Supreme Court ruled in Chapman v. California that a constitutional error will only be considered harmless when the court is \" able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \" . Additionally , when reviewing federal habeas corpus petitions , a petitioner must demonstrate that an error \" had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury 's verdict \" . The Supreme Court has also ruled that when reviewing a determination of harmlessness under Chapman , the AEDPA mandates that the reviewing court may not grant a petition for habeas corpus \" unless the harmlessness determination itself was unreasonable \" . According to the Supreme Court , the rationale underlying this doctrine is the public policy concern that states courts should not be forced to undertake the \" arduous task \" of retrying criminal defendants \" based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error \" . = = Arrest and Trial of Hector Ayala = = Hector Ayala was charged with three counts of murder that allegedly occurred during an attempted robbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego , California in April 1985 . During jury selection , the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service . Ayala , who was of Hispanic descent , filed a series of Batson challenges to contest the prosecution 's use of peremptory challenges . The trial judge permitted the prosecution to explain the basis of their peremptory challenges in a closed hearing , outside the presence of Ayala 's counsel , \" so as not to disclose trial strategy \" . The trial court ultimately concluded that the peremptory challenges were based on race-neutral criteria , and Ayala was convicted of the three counts of murder in August 1989 . The jury returned a sentence of death for the three murder convictions , and the trial judge entered a judgment consistent with the jury 's sentence . On direct appeal , the California Supreme Court upheld Ayala 's conviction and sentence , noting that even if the trial judge committed an error when considering the defense 's Batson challenges , that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt . Ayala subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus , which was denied by a district court judge in 2006 . On appeal , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted Ayala 's habeas petition in 2013 , holding that Ayala was denied due process at trial and that the trial court 's error was not harmless . In 2014 , the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit 's ruling . = = Opinion of the Court = = In his majority opinion , Justice Samuel Alito held that the exclusion of Ayala 's counsel during the Batson hearings was harmless error . Justice Alito emphasized that under federal law , prisoners are not entitled to habeas relief unless they can demonstrate \" actual prejudice \" . Additionally , Justice Alito noted that under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act , federal courts should be \" highly deferential \" to state courts \" when a prisoner 's ' claim ' has been ' adjudicated on the merits ' in state court \" . Applying these standards to the facts of this case , Justice Alito ruled that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice and that the California Supreme Court 's opinion \" represented an entirely reasonable application of controlling precedent \" . Consequently , Justice Alito held that the Ninth Circuit 's ruling should be reversed and that the case should be remanded for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court 's decision . = = = Concurring opinions = = = Although he noted that his support for the majority 's opinion was \" unqualified \" , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of solitary confinement . Justice Kennedy observed that since 1989 , Ayala had spent more than twenty five years in solitary confinement . Although the conditions of Ayala 's confinement were not established in the record , Justice Kennedy wrote that \" it is likely [ he ] has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day ; and in the one hour when he leaves it , he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone \" . Justice Kennedy wrote that \" [ t ] he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood , and questioned , by writers and commentators \" and that solitary confinement \" bears a further terror and peculiar mark of infamy \" . Justice Kennedy conceded that \" in some instances temporary , solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates \" , but that courts should ultimately determine \" whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist , and , if so , whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them \" . Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate , one-paragraph concurring opinion to respond to Justice Kennedy 's concurring opinion . He wrote that the \" accommodations in which Ayala is housed are a far sight more spacious than those in which his victims , Ernesto Dominguez Mendez , Marcos Antonio Zamora , and Jose Luis Rositas , now rest \" . Justice Thomas also noted that because Ayala 's victims were all 31 years of age or younger , \" Ayala will soon have had as much or more time to enjoy those accommodations as his victims had time to enjoy this Earth \" . = = = Justice Sotomayor 's dissenting opinion = = = Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Justice Stephen Breyer , and Justice Elena Kagan . Justice Sotomayor argued that the exclusion of Ayala 's counsel from the Batson hearings \" substantially influenced the outcome \" of the case and that \" grave doubt exists as to whether [ the exclusion ] was harmless \" . She critiqued Justice Alito 's methodological approach , arguing that \" [ t ] he proper inquiry is not whether the trial court \u2019 s determination can be sustained , but whether it may have been different had counsel been present \" . Considering the evidence presented in this case , Justice Sotomayor concluded that there \" is neither a factual nor a legal basis for the Court \u2019 s confidence \" that the prosecution 's use of peremptory challenges was race neutral . She argued that in light of \" the strength of Ayala \u2019 s prima facie case \" , the Court should have upheld the Ninth Circuit 's ruling . = = Commentary and analysis = = Following the release of the Court 's opinion , commentators described Davis v. Ayala as \" an important case raising claims about jury selection and harmless error \" . Steve Vladeck wrote that \" [ g ] oing forward , the dispute between the majority and dissent will have an especially significant effect on cases in which trial courts conduct Batson proceedings ex parte \" . Hadar Aviram wrote that \" [ t ] he Court was willing to accept , as a basic premise , that Ayala 's constitutional rights were violated ; but that is not enough to merit a reversal \" . In his review of the case for The New Yorker , Lincoln Caplan described the Court 's opinion as \" particularly unjust \" because the Court \" had the opportunity to hold a state prosecutor to account for using trumped-up reasons to justify racial discrimination in a jury selection \" but failed to do so . = = = Commentary about Justice Kennedy 's concurring opinion = = = Much of the initial commentary about the case focused on Justice Kennedy 's concurring opinion . Writing for the Los Angeles Times , David G. Savage described Justice Kennedy 's opinion as \" unusual \" and \" a rare instance of a Supreme Court justice virtually inviting a constitutional challenge to a prison policy \" . Marty Lederman described Justice Kennedy 's concurring opinion as \" the single most surprising and heartening development of the term \" . Matt Ford wrote that \" Kennedy \u2019 s critique of solitary confinement in Davis came without warning or fanfare \" and that \" [ s ] olitary confinement is a new battleground for the Court \u2019 s second-longest serving justice , but not a surprising one \" . Although he suggested Justice Kennedy 's concurrence may be \" more consequential \" than Justice Harry Blackmun 's dissent in Callins v. Collins , Mark Joseph Stern described Justice Kennedy 's concurrence as \" myopic \" , noting that \" large chunks of the ' legal academy ' in the ' public ' were aware \u2014 and outraged \u2014 by the practice long before Kennedy condemned it \" . Dahlia Lithwick wrote that even though \" Kennedy may not come around on the death penalty \" and rule it unconstitutional , \" after reading his own words in Ayala \u2014 he probably should \" . In an interview with Harvard Law School dean Martha Minow , Justice Kennedy explained that when he was in the Army , he was locked in a cell for four hours and \" slightly tortured \" . Justice Kennedy remarked that \" [ a ] fter four hours in a cell , I was going mad . These people are in , some for 40 years . It drives people mad and we don \u2019 t even think about it . We \u2019 ve got to do something about it \" .",

                    "text": "Pedra Branca dispute = The Pedra Branca dispute [ 2008 ] ICJ 2 was a territorial dispute between Singapore and Malaysia over several islets at the eastern entrance to the Singapore Strait , namely Pedra Branca ( previously called Pulau Batu Puteh and now Batu Puteh by Malaysia ) , Middle Rocks and South Ledge . The dispute began in 1979 and was largely resolved by the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in 2008 , which opined that Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore and Middle Rocks belonged to Malaysia . In early 1980 , Singapore lodged a formal protest with Malaysia in response to a map published by Malaysia in 1979 claiming Pedra Branca . In 1989 Singapore proposed submitting the dispute to the ICJ . Malaysia agreed to this in 1994 . In 1993 , Singapore also claimed the nearby islets Middle Rocks and South Ledge . In 1998 the two countries agreed on the text of a Special Agreement that was needed to submit the dispute to the ICJ . The Special Agreement was signed in February 2003 , and the ICJ formally notified of the Agreement in July that year . The hearing before the ICJ was held over three weeks in November 2007 under the name Sovereignty over Pedra Branca / Pulau Batu Puteh , Middle Rocks and South Ledge ( Malaysia v. Singapore ) . Singapore argued that Pedra Branca was terra nullius , and that there was no evidence the island had ever been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate . In the event the Court did not accept this argument , Singapore contended that sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore due to the consistent exercise of authority over the island by Singapore and its predecessor , the United Kingdom . The actions taken included selecting Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and constructing the lighthouse , requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits , installing a military rebroadcast station on the island , and studying the feasibility of reclaiming land around the island . Malaysia had remained silent in the face of these activities . In addition , it had confirmed in a 1953 letter that Johor did not claim ownership of the island , and had published official reports and maps indicating that it regarded Pedra Branca as Singapore territory . Middle Rocks and South Ledge should be regarded as dependencies of Pedra Branca . Malaysia 's case was that Johor had original title to Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge . Johor had not ceded Pedra Branca to the United Kingdom , but had merely granted permission for the lighthouse to be built and maintained on it . The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island 's sovereign . Further , the 1953 letter had been unauthorised and the official reports and maps it had issued were either irrelevant or inconclusive . On 23 May 2008 , the Court ruled that Pedra Branca is under Singapore 's sovereignty , while Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia . As regards South Ledge , the Court noted that it falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia , Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks . As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide , it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located . Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks , and to determine the ownership of South Ledge . = = Dispute = = Pedra Branca is a small granite outcrop located 25 nautical miles ( 46 km ; 29 mi ) east of Singapore and 7.7 nautical miles ( 14.3 km ; 8.9 mi ) south of Johor , Malaysia , where the Singapore Strait meets the South China Sea . There are two maritime features near the island : Middle Rocks , 0.6 nautical miles ( 1.1 km ; 0.69 mi ) south of Pedra Branca , which consists of two clusters of small rocks about 250 metres ( 820 ft ) apart ; and South Ledge , 2.2 nautical miles ( 4.1 km ; 2.5 mi ) south-south-west of Pedra Branca , which is visible only at low tide . Singapore has been administering Pedra Branca since Horsburgh Lighthouse was built on the island by its predecessor , the United Kingdom , between 1850 and 1851 . Singapore was ceded by Sultan Hussein Shah and Temenggung Abdul Rahman Sri Maharajah of Johor to the British East India Company under a Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 2 August 1824 ( the Crawfurd Treaty ) , and became part of the Straits Settlements in 1826 . At the time when the lighthouse on the island was constructed , the Straits Settlements were under British rule through the Government of India . On 21 December 1979 , the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca to be within its territorial waters . Singapore rejected this \" claim \" in a diplomatic note of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to be corrected . In the late 1980s , Attorney-General of Singapore Tan Boon Teik was despatched by the Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew to disclose the documentary evidence which Singapore had to the Malaysian Attorney-General , to demonstrate the strength of Singapore 's case . However , the dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994 . In the first round of talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised . Malaysia and Singapore therefore agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) . = = Procedural matters = = Singapore first suggested submitting the territorial dispute to the ICJ in 1989 . The suggestion was accepted by Malaysia in 1994 . In 1998 , the text of a Special Agreement to bring the matter before the ICJ was agreed , and the Agreement was signed by the two countries at Putrajaya , Malaysia , on 6 February 2003 . It was notified to the Court in July 2003 . The case was assigned the name Sovereignty over Pedra Branca / Pulau Batu Puteh , Middle Rocks and South Ledge ( Malaysia v. Singapore ) . Following directions issued by the Court , the parties exchanged memorials on 25 March 2004 , counter-memorials on 25 January 2005 , and replies on 25 November 2005 . As the parties informed the Court by a letter dated 23 January 2006 that rejoinders were unnecessary , the written proceedings were closed . The Court determined by drawing lots that Singapore would present its case first . Public hearings were held between 6 and 23 November 2007 , with Singapore presenting its case from 6 to 9 November , and Malaysia doing the same from 13 to 16 November 2007 . Each country was then given two days to respond , with 19 and 20 November allocated to Singapore , and 22 and 23 November allocated to Malaysia . The persons who spoke for the parties were : For Singapore : Tommy Koh , Ambassador-at-Large , Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( Singapore ) ; Professor of Law at the National University of Singapore ( acting as Singapore 's Agent ) ; Chao Hick Tin , Attorney-General of Singapore ( Counsel and Advocate ) ; Chan Sek Keong , Chief Justice of Singapore ( Counsel and Advocate ) ; Alain Pellet , Professor at the Paris X University Nanterre ; member and former Chairman of the United Nations International Law Commission ; associate member of the Institut de Droit International ( Counsel and Advocate ) ; Ian Brownlie , C.B.E. , Q.C. , F.B.A. ; member of the English Bar ; Chairman of the UN International Law Commission ; Emeritus Chichele Professor of Public International Law , University of Oxford ; member of the Institut de Droit International ; Distinguished Fellow , All Souls College , Oxford ( Counsel and Advocate ) ; Rodman R.

Kohen , Professor of International Law , Graduate Institute of International Studies , Geneva ; associate member of the Institut de Droit International ( Counsel ) ; and Penelope Nevill , college lecturer , Downing College , Cambridge . The case was presided over by ICJ Vice-President Judge Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh , alongside 13 other judges and two ad hoc judges appointed by the two countries . The judges were Raymond Ranjeva from Madagascar , Shi Jiuyong from the People 's Republic of China , Abdul G. Koroma from Sierra Leone , Gonzalo Parra Aranguren from Venezuela , Thomas Buergenthal from the United States , Hisashi Owada from Japan , Bruno Simma from Germany , Peter Tomka from Slovakia , Ronny Abraham from France , Kenneth Keith from New Zealand , Bernardo Sep\u00falveda Amor from Mexico , Mohamed Bennouna from Morocco and Leonid Skotnikov from Russia . As the Bench of the Court did not include any judges of the nationality of either party , the parties exercised their right to choose judges ad hoc to sit in the case . Singapore appointed Pemmaraju Sreenivasa Rao from India , and Malaysia Christopher John Robert Dugard from South Africa . = = Singapore 's case = = = = = Pedra Branca terra nullius = = = Singapore argued that in 1847 Pedra Branca was terra nullius ( Latin for \" land belonging to no one \" ) as it had never been the subject of a prior claim or manifestation of sovereignty by any sovereign entity . It denied Malaysia 's claim that the island had been under Johor 's sovereignty . It contended there was no evidence that the Johor Sultanate had claimed or exercised authority over Pedra Branca between 1512 and 1641 . This period began with the fall of the Malacca Sultanate to the Portuguese in 1512 , who continued to harass the Johor Sultanate during this time , as did the Aceh Sultanate . Similarly , there was no evidence of Johor 's sovereignty over Pedra Branca between 1641 and 1699 , when Johor 's power and influence were at their height ; between 1699 and 1784 when the death of Sultan Mahmud Shah II in 1699 without a clear heir led to instability , during which many vassals broke away from the Sultanate ; and between 1784 and 1824 when , according to a 1949 annual report of the Johor government , the Sultanate was in a \" state of dissolution \" by the beginning of the 19th century . To support its assertion that the Sultan of Johor did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca , Singapore contended that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory . Thus , the only reliable way to determine whether a particular territory belonged to a ruler was to find out whether the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler . This was difficult to do with respect to Pedra Branca since it was isolated and uninhabited , and Malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over the island . In addition , Singapore claimed that the old Johor Sultanate , which controlled a maritime Malay empire from a capital on the Johor River , was not the same as the new Johor Sultanate occupying only the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula that came into existence after the signing of the Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands . In its view , the Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty did not divide up the Singapore Strait , in which Pedra Branca is situated , between the new Johor Sultanate under the British sphere of influence and the Riau-Lingga Sultanate under Dutch influence . Instead , both Britain and the Netherlands could access the Strait freely . Therefore , there was a legal vacuum with regard to sovereignty over the island , enabling the British to lawfully take possession of it between 1847 and 1851 . Following the death of Sultan Mahmud Shah III of Johor in 1812 , his two sons Hussein and Abdul Rahman vied for the throne of the Johor Sultanate . The United Kingdom recognised the elder son Hussein , who was based in Singapore , as the rightful heir , while the Netherlands recognised the younger son Abdul Rahman who was based in Riau ( now Bintan , Indonesia ) . A year after the Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty , Abdul Rahman sent a letter dated 25 June 1825 to Hussein . In it he stated that , \" in complete agreement with the spirit and the content of the treaty concluded between their Majesties , the Kings of the Netherlands and Great Britain \" , he donated to his older brother \" [ t ] he part of the lands assigned to [ Great Britain ] \" : Your territory , thus , extends over Johor and Pahang on the mainland or on the Malay Peninsula . The territory of Your Brother [ Abdul Rahman ] extends out over the islands of Lingga , Bintan , Galang , Bulan , Karimon and all other islands . Whatsoever may be in the sea , this is the territory of Your Brother , and whatever is situated on the mainland is yours . On the basis of this letter , Singapore argued that Abdul Rahman had only donated the mainland territories to Hussein and had retained sovereignty over all the islands in the sea . Pedra Branca therefore never became a part of Johor . = = = Lawful taking of ownership = = = In the event that the Court rejected the argument that Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847 , Singapore contended that the selection of Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and the construction of the lighthouse between 1847 and 1851 constituted a taking of possession of the island \u00e0 titre de souverain ( with the title of a sovereign ) . The British Crown obtained title over the island in accordance with legal principles governing the acquisition of territory at that time . This title was maintained by the United Kingdom and its lawful successor , the Republic of Singapore . Singapore claimed that it and its predecessor the United Kingdom had demonstrated a consistent exercise of authority over the island through various acts since 1847 . For instance , during the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone of the lighthouse on 24 May 1850 , Pedra Branca was described as a \" dependency of Singapore \" in the presence of the Governor of the Straits Settlements \u2013 the most senior British official in Singapore \u2013 and other British and foreign officials . The attribution of sovereignty was widely reported in local newspapers , but drew no response from the Johor authorities . Other significant acts included the following : Singapore had investigated shipwrecks in the waters around the island between 1920 and 1979 . It had exercised exclusive control over the use of the island and visits to the island , including requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island for scientific surveys to obtain permits . It had displayed British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse . Furthermore , it had acceded to a request by Malaysia in 1968 to remove the Singapore flag from another island , Pulau Pisang , which is under Malaysian sovereignty . Malaysia had made no such request in respect of Pedra Branca . On 30 May 1977 , the Port of Singapore Authority ( PSA ) allowed the Republic of Singapore Navy to install a military rebroadcast station on the island . On the direction of the Government of Singapore , in 1972 , 1973 , 1974 and 1978 the PSA studied the feasibility of reclaiming 5,000 square metres ( 54,000 sq ft ) of land around the island . Tenders for the project were sought through newspaper advertisements , though eventually the project was not proceeded with . In addition , Singapore had on two occasions claimed the sea around Pedra Branca as its territorial waters . The first occasion was in July 1952 when the Chief Surveyor expressed the opinion that Singapore should claim a 3-mile ( 4.8 km ) limit around the island . Subsequently in 1967 , the Singapore Government 's Marine Department also stated in an official memorandum to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( Singapore ) that the waters within three miles of Pedra Branca might be considered Singapore territorial waters . = = = Malaysia 's inaction and acceptance of Singapore 's sovereignty = = = It was also Singapore 's case that for over 130 years since 1847 , Malaysia had been silent over Singapore 's activities and exercise of sovereignty over Pedra Branca . No other state had challenged Singapore 's claims , and she had done so without having to seek approval from any other state . During the hearing , Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh highlighted this by saying : A key feature of this case is the constant stream of Singapore 's acts of administration in relation to Pedra Branca , contrasted with the complete absence of Malaysian activities on Pedra Branca or within its territorial waters , and with Malaysia 's silence in the face of all these state activities of Singapore ... Such silence on Malaysia 's part is significant and must be taken to mean that Malaysia never regarded Pedra Branca as her territory . On 12 June 1953 , when Singapore was a Crown Colony , its Colonial Secretary J. D. Higham wrote to the British Adviser to the Sultan of Johor to clarify the status of Pedra Branca . He noted that the rock was outside the limits ceded by Sultan Hussein Shah and the Temenggung with the island of Singapore under the 1824 Crawfurd Treaty they had entered into with the East India Company . However , the Colonial Government had been maintaining the lighthouse built on it , and \" [ t ] his by international usage no doubt confers some rights and obligations on the Colony \" . He therefore asked if \" there is any document showing a lease or grant of the rock or whether it has been ceded by the Government of the State of Johore or in any other way disposed of \" . The Acting State Secretary of Johor , M. Seth bin Saaid , replied on 21 September that \" the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca \" . Singapore contended that this reply confirmed Singapore 's sovereignty over the island and that Johor had no title , historic or otherwise , to it . The Colony of Singapore became a self-governing state in 1959 , and left the British Empire to join the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 . Two years later , in 1965 , Singapore became a fully independent republic . In 1959 , in an official publication regarding meteorological information collected on Pedra Branca , Malaya listed Horsburgh Lighthouse as a \" Singapore \" station together with the Sultan Shoal and Raffles Lighthouses . The lighthouse on Pedra Branca was described in the same way in a joint Malaysian and Singaporean publication in 1966 , the year after Singapore left the Federation . In 1967 , when the two countries began reporting meteorological information separately , Malaysia ceased referring to Horsburgh Lighthouse . In maps published by the Malayan and Malaysian Surveyor General and Director of General Mapping in 1962 , 1965 , 1970 , 1974 and 1975 , the island was indicated with the word \" ( SINGAPORE ) \" or \" ( SINGAPURA ) \" under it . The same designation was used for an island that was unquestionably under Singapore 's sovereignty . On the other hand , the designation was not used for Pulau Pisang , an island under Malaysian sovereignty on which Singapore operated a lighthouse . At a news conference in May 1980 attended by Malaysia 's former Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn and Singapore 's then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew , the Malaysian leader admitted that the question of sovereignty over Pedra Branca was \" not very clear \" to Malaysia . On 19 November 2007 , Singapore Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar refuted Malaysia 's claim that Singapore was attempting to subvert the status quo by claiming sovereignty of Pedra Branca . He said Singapore was \" an honest , law-abiding state that has never and will never do anything to endanger navigational safety , security arrangements or the Singapore Strait 's environment \" . Rather , it was Malaysia that had sought to alter the status quo by publishing a map in 1979 that altered maritime boundaries with seven neighbouring countries . This was evidenced by a telegram that the Malaysian Government had sent to its overseas missions in December 1979 , notifying them that the map would \" affect \" Brunei , China , Indonesia , the Philippines , Thailand , Singapore and Vietnam . = = = Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge one entity = = = Singapore took the position that Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge should be considered a single group of maritime features as Middle Rocks and South Ledge were dependencies of Pedra Branca . It relied , among others , on the Island of Palmas Case ( 1932 ) : \" As regards a group of islands , it is possible that a group may under certain circumstances be regarded as in law a unit , and that the fate of the principal part may involve the rest . \" It argued that the three maritime features were geomorphologically the same , as rock samples showed that they were all composed of a light , coarse-grained biotite granite . Additionally , Malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over the uninhabited reefs of Middle Rocks and South Ledge while Singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in the surrounding waters . Since sovereignty over Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore , so did sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge as they were within Pedra Branca 's territorial waters . = = Malaysia 's case = = = = = Pedra Branca not terra nullius = = = Malaysia 's case was that it had original title to Pedra Branca \" from time immemorial \" . The island could not at any relevant time have been terra nullius as it is and had always been part of Johor , which is now a state of Malaysia . Nothing that the United Kingdom or Singapore had done had displaced its sovereignty over it . Contrary to what Singapore had claimed , there had been no break between the old Sultanate of Johor and the new Johor Sultanate ruled by Sultan Hussein that came into existence after the signing of the 1824 Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty . The Treaty had the effect of leaving the islands south of the Singapore Strait within the Dutch sphere of influence ( the Riau \u2013 Lingga Sultanate ) , while the territory and islands in the Strait and to its north were within the British sphere of influence ( the new Johor Sultanate ) . A few months after the conclusion of the Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty , the Sultan and the Temenggung of Johor entered into the Crawfurd Treaty with the East India Company on 2 August 1824 . Article II of the Crawfurd Treaty stated : Their Highnesses the Sultan Hussein Mahomed Shah and Datu Tumungong Abdul Rahman Sri Maharajah hereby cede in full sovereignty and property to the Honourable the English East India Company , their heirs and successors for ever , the Island of Singapore situated in the Straits of Malacca , together with the adjacent seas , straits , and islets , to the extent of ten geographical miles , from the coast of the said main island of Singapore . Since Johor could not have ceded Singapore island and the islets in its vicinity to the British if it lacked title to them , this was evidence that the United Kingdom recognised the prior and continuing sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate over all islands in and around the Singapore Strait . Malaysia challenged Singapore 's contention that Pedra Branca never became part of the new Johor Sultanate because 25 June 1825 letter from Sultan Abdul Rahman of Riau \u2013 Lingga to Sultan Hussain showed that Abdul Rahman had only donated territories on the mainland of the Malay Peninsula to Hussein and had retained sovereignty over all the islands in the sea . Malaysia submitted Abdul Rahman 's statement that his territory \" extends out over the islands of Lingga , Bintan , Galang , Bulan , Karimon and all other islands \" had to be read in the context of Article XII of the 1824 Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty , which guaranteed that no \" British Establishment \" would be made \" on the Carimon Isles , or on the Island of Bantam , Bintang , Lingin , or on any of the other Islands South of the Straits of Singapore \" . Three of the islands mentioned by Abdul Rahman \u2013 Bintan , Karimun and Lingga \u2013 were islands that the British had agreed were not within their sphere of influence , while the other two \u2013 Bulan and Galang \u2013 lay south of the Singapore Strait . Therefore , the phrase \" all other islands \" in Abdul Rahman 's letter referred only to islands lying within the Dutch sphere of influence . The letter was simply formal recognition that Abdul Rahman did not claim sovereignty over Johor . The Johor Sultanate 's title to the island was also confirmed by ties of loyalty that existed between the Sultanate and the Orang Laut , a nomadic sea people who in the past had inhabited the maritime areas of the Singapore Strait , carrying out fishing and piracy , and had visited Pedra Branca quite frequently . This was evidenced by three 19th-century letters written by British officials , including one dated November 1850 by John Turnbull Thomson , the Government Surveyor of Singapore , which had reported on the need to exclude the Orang Laut from Pedra Branca where Horsburgh Lighthouse was being built . Thomson noted that they \" frequently visit the rock so their visits should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them ... In the straits and islets of the neighbouring shores and islands many lives are taken by these people . \" Malaysia rejected Singapore 's argument that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory . It stated that authority in states throughout the world is based on a combination of control over people and territory , and that this applies to the Malay States as it does to any other state . Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century , it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people 's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived . = = = Actions of United Kingdom and Singapore those of lighthouse operator = = = Malaysia averred that the actions of the United Kingdom and its successor Singapore in constructing and maintaining Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca were actions of the operator of the lighthouse and not the sovereign of the island . Johor had at no time ceded the island to the United Kingdom , but instead had merely granted permission for the lighthouse to be built and maintained on it . Captain James Horsburgh , a Scottish hydrographer to the British East India Company who had prepared many charts and sailing instructions for the East Indies , China , New Holland , the Cape of Good Hope and other intermediate ports , died in May 1836 . Merchants and mariners felt that the building of one or more lighthouses would be a fitting tribute to him , and in as early as November 1836 Pedra Branca was proposed as one of the preferred sites . By 1844 , preference had been expressed for Romania Outer Island , or Peak Rock . Some time in November 1844 , the Governor of the Straits Settlements , William John Butterworth , wrote to the Sultan and the Temenggung of Johor regarding the matter . His letters have not been found , but English translations of the replies , dated 25 November 1844 , exist . The Sultan said : I have received my friend 's letter , and in reply desire to acquaint my friend , that I perfectly understand his wishes , and I am exceedingly pleased at the intention expressed therein , as it ( a Light House ) will enable Traders and others to enter and leave this Port with greater Confidence . The Temenggung responded thus : I have duly received my friend 's communication , and understand the contents . My friend is desirous of erecting a Light House near Point Romania . I can have no possible objection to such a measure , indeed I am much pleased that such an undertaking is in contemplation . I wish to be guided in all matters by the Government , so much so , that the [ East India ] company are at full liberty to put up a Light House there , or any spot deemed eligible . Myself and family for many years have derived support from Singapore , our dependence is wholly on the English Government , and we hope to merit the protection of , and be favoured by the Company on all occasions consistent with propriety . Three days later , on 28 November 1844 , the Governor wrote to the Secretary of the Government in India to recommend that the lighthouse be sited on Peak Rock . Among other things , he said that \" [ t ] his Rock is part of the Territories of the Rajah of Johore , who with the Tamongong ... have willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the East India Company \" , and enclosed the replies received from the Sultan and Temenggung . Nonetheless , Malaysia argued that the Sultan and Temenggung 's letters amounted to no more than permission to the United Kingdom to build and operate a lighthouse on Peak Rock or some other suitable location . On 13 November , Malaysia 's Agent , Ambassador-at-Large Abdul Kadir Mohamad , alleged that Singapore was trying to \" subvert \" a 150-year-old arrangement under which Singapore operated Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca , which was Malaysia 's territory . He also suggested that if permitted to do so , Singapore would upset the peace and stability of the area where the island is located . He said that if Singapore reclaimed land around Pedra Branca , \" [ q ] uite apart from the possible effects on the environment and navigation in the Strait , this could lead to potentially serious changes to the security arrangements in the eastern entrance of the Strait \" . According to Malaysian Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail , Singapore had first raised the issue of sovereignty over Pedra Branca on 13 April 1978 during a meeting between officials , saying it had \" incontrovertible legal evidence \" of its sovereignty over the island though it had never produced any documents in support . Prior to that , the sovereignty of the island had never been disputed . The 1980 statement by the then Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn concerning the \" unclear \" position of the island had also been premised on these documents which former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had claimed were in Singapore 's possession . The statement was therefore merely a friendly and respectful statement of a visiting prime minister at a press conference which had no probative value in court . All Hussein Onn had meant was that the matter required further discussion between the two countries . = = = = 1953 letter by Acting State Secretary of Johor unauthorised = = = = Concerning the letter of 21 September 1953 in which the Acting State Secretary of Johor informed the Colonial Secretary of Singapore that \" the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca \" , Malaysia submitted that the Colonial Secretary 's enquiry of 12 June 1953 about the status of Pedra Branca showed that the Singapore authorities had no conviction that the island was part of its territory . Further , the Acting State Secretary \" was definitely not authorized \" and did not have \" the legal capacity to write the 1953 letter , or to renounce , disclaim , or confirm title of any part of the territories of Johor \" . Under two treaties of 21 January 1948 , the Johor Agreement between the British Crown and the Sultan of Johor and the Federation of Malaya Agreement between the British Crown and nine Malay States including Johor , Johor transferred all its rights , power and jurisdiction on matters relating to defence and external affairs to the United Kingdom . These powers were exercisable by the Federal High Commissioner appointed by the United Kingdom and not by the Johor State Secretary . The Acting State Secretary had improperly taken it upon himself to reply to the Colonial Secretary 's letter and had not submitted a copy of it to the Chief Secretary of Johor . There was no evidence that the Chief Secretary or the High Commissioner was aware of its contents . = = = = Singapore 's actions in respect of Pedra Branca not as sovereign = = = = Regarding Singapore 's contentions that it had exercised sovereign authority over Pedra Branca in various ways , Malaysia responded as indicated below : Investigation of shipwrecks in vicinity of Pedra Branca . Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator , and under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea . Therefore , by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca 's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not \u00e0 titre de souverain . The circumstances of the particular investigations also meant that Singapore 's ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over the island . Display of British and Singapore ensigns on island . Ensigns , associated with maritime matters , are marks of nationality and not sovereignty . Singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in the flying of the British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse . The Pulau Pisang incident was not an acknowledgement by Malaysia of Singapore 's sovereignty over Pedra Branca ; it had been a matter of domestic political sensibility \u2013 Pulau Pisang is much larger than Pedra Branca and has a small local population . Installation of military communications equipment and plans to reclaim land . Malaysia alleged that Singapore 's installation of military communications equipment on Pedra Branca was done secretly , and that it had only learned about this when it received Singapore 's memorial in the case . As regards Singapore 's plans to reclaim land around the island , Malaysia said it could not have reacted to some of the documents as they had been secret . = = = = Meteorological reports irrelevant ; maps inconclusive = = = = In response to Singapore 's contention in respect of meteorological reports published by Malaysia that had indicated Pedra Branca as a Singapore station , Malaysia said the fact that it recognised Horsburgh Lighthouse as a Singapore rainfall station did not amount an acknowledgement of sovereignty . The six maps that it had published between 1962 and 1975 which had printed the word \" ( SINGAPORE ) \" or \" ( SINGAPURA ) \" beneath the island were inconclusive . This was because the annotating could be assessed differently , the maps contained disclaimers stating they could not be considered an authority on the delimitation of international or other boundaries , and maps do not create title and cannot amount to admissions unless incorporated into treaties or used in inter-state negotiations . = = = Middle Rocks and South Ledge belong to Malaysia = = = Malaysia contended that Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge were not a single identifiable entity . The historical record showed that the three maritime features were never formally described as a single island with appurtenant islands , or as a group of islands . Middle Rocks and South Ledge were therefore under Johor sovereignty at the time of the 1824 Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty and fell within the British sphere of influence under the Treaty . Malaysia had exercised consistent acts of sovereignty over them within the limits of their character . For instance , in 1968 the Malaysian Government used and granted petroleum concessions which extended to the area of Middle Rocks and South Ledge . Also , an internal confidential document dated 16 July 1968 entitled \" Letter of Promulgation \" by the Chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy included charts showing that Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge were within Malaysia 's territorial waters , and the features were included within Malaysian fisheries waters in the Fisheries Act 1985 . Singapore had neither protested against these manifestations of sovereignty , nor advanced any claims over Middle Rocks and South Ledge in 1980 when it began claiming that Pedra Branca belonged to it . = = Controversies = = = = = Reliability of Malaysia 's photograph of Pedra Branca = = = In the course of the hearing , to demonstrate Pedra Branca 's proximity to the Johor mainland , Malaysia produced a photograph taken of Pedra Branca with Point Romania and a hill named Mount Berbukit , both in Johor , in the background . However , on 19 November 2007 Singapore produced another photograph taken using a camera that approximated what the human eye sees , and pointed out that in it Mount Berbukit appeared much smaller . It alleged that Malaysia 's photograph had been taken using a telephoto lens , which had exaggerated the height of Mount Berbukit by about seven times . Singapore 's then Attorney-General Chao Hick Tin said that the photograph had been \" an attempt to convey a subliminal message of proximity between Pedra Branca and the coast of Johor \" , but it was not an accurate reflection of what visitors to Pedra Branca would see if they were looking towards Johor . Malaysia claimed its photograph was obtained from an online blog , Singapore called the blog \" most unusual \" , noting that it had been created only a month earlier ; that the photograph had only been uploaded on 2 November , four days before the oral proceedings in the case had commenced ; and that there was no information on the blogger 's identity . In its rebuttal on 24 November , Malaysia said that the difference between the photographs was \" all a question of perspective \" and that the matter was not worth discussing . = = = Missing 1844 letters = = = A key thrust of Malaysia 's case was that the British had received explicit permission from Johor to build a lighthouse on Pedra Branca , which proved that the British had recognised Johor 's sovereignty over the island . It submitted that this was evidenced by the November 1844 letters that Governor Butterworth had written to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor regarding the construction of the lighthouse . Malaysia said it had written to Singapore asking for copies of the letters , because if the letters still existed they were probably in Singapore 's archives in a file entitled \" Letters to Native Rulers \" . However , Singapore had never replied . Singapore 's response was that it did not have copies of the letters . Its archives were incomplete , and searches for them in other archives had been in vain . Furthermore , the letters were more likely to be in Malaysia 's possession as the Governor had sent them to the Johor rulers . In his rebuttal of Malaysia 's case on 19 November 2007 , Singapore 's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar expressed disappointment with Malaysia 's insinuation that Singapore had concealed the letters from the Court , which he termed \" most disturbing \" , \" baseless \" and \" distracting \" . Malaysia did not mention the matter further in its rebuttal on 24 November . = = ICJ decision = = The ICJ rendered its decision on 23 May 2008 . It held by 12 votes to four that sovereignty over Pedra Branca belongs to Singapore . It further held , by 15 votes to one , that sovereignty over Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia , and sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located . = = = Pedra Branca originally under sovereignty of Johor Sultanate = = = The Court agreed with Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had original title to Pedra Branca , rejecting Singapore 's argument that the island was terra nullius . It found it was not disputed that Johor had established itself as a sovereign state with a certain territorial domain in Southeast Asia since it came into existence in 1512 . As Pedra Branca had always been known as a navigational hazard in the Singapore Strait , which was a vital channel for international navigation in east-west trade between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea , it was inconceivable that the island had remained undiscovered by the local community . It was therefore reasonable to infer that Pedra Branca lay within the general geographical scope of the Johor Sultanate . Further , during the existence of the old Johor Sultanate , there was no evidence of any competing claims over the islands in the Singapore Strait . It also agreed with Malaysia 's submission that descriptions of the relationship between the Sultan of Johor and the Orang Laut in 19th-century official British reports proved that the Sultan exercised sovereign authority over the Orang Laut . Since the Orang Laut made the islands in the Singapore Strait their habitat , this confirmed the \" ancient original title \" of the Johor Sultanate to those islands , including Pedra Branca . As regards Singapore 's argument that the traditional concept of Malay sovereignty was based on control over people rather than territory , the Court observed that sovereignty comprises control over both persons and territory . However , it was not necessary to deal with the point further as it had already found that Johor had territorial sovereignty over Pedra Branca . The purpose of the 1824 Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty was to finally settle the disputes that had arisen between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands relating to their territorial possessions and commercial interests in the East Indies . It was thus most unlikely that the parties had left the maritime features in the Singapore Straits outside their spheres of influence , as Singapore had contended . Under Article XII of the Treaty , Britain had agreed that \" no British Establishment shall be made on the Carimon Isles , or on the Island of Bantam , Bintang , Lingin , or on any of the other Islands South of the Straits of Singapore ... \" The islands and islets within the Straits therefore fell within the British sphere of influence . This included Pedra Branca , which remained part of the territorial domain of the new Johor Sultanate . That this was the British understanding of the Treaty was confirmed by a letter dated 4 March 1825 from the Government of India to John Crawfurd , the British Resident in Singapore , which read : \" [ O ] ur acquisition of these Islets [ under the Crawfurd Treaty ] is not at variance with the obligations of the Treaty concluded at London in March last [ the 1824 Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty ] as they are all situated North of the Southern limits of the Straights of Singapore ... \" [ Emphasis added . ] Therefore , Britain 's position was that every island north of the southern limits of the Singapore Strait fell within its sphere of influence . The Court 's reading of the Anglo \u2013 Dutch Treaty was reinforced by letter of 25 June 1825 from Sultan Abdul Rahman to his brother Sultan Hussain , which did not have the effect Singapore attributed to it . Contrary to Malaysia 's submission , the Court found that the Crawfurd Treaty did not show that Britain recognised Johor 's sovereignty over all the islands in and around the Singapore Strait . Article II only referred to the cession by the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor of \" the Island of Singapore ... together with the adjacent seas , straits , and islets to the extent of ten geographical miles \" to the British , and could not be read as an acknowledgement by the United Kingdom that Johor sovereignty over any other territory . = = = Sovereignty over Pedra Branca passed to Singapore = = = The ICJ noted that under certain circumstances , sovereignty over territory may pass due to the failure of the state which has sovereignty to respond to the other state 's conduct \u00e0 titre de souverain , that is , concrete manifestations of the display of territorial sovereignty by the other state . Because there was no written agreement relating to Horsburgh Lighthouse and Pedra Branca , the Court was unable to determine whether the November 1844 replies by the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor to Governor Butterworth 's query amounted to a cession of the place that would be chosen for the site of the lighthouse or was merely a permission to build , maintain and operate a lighthouse there . Although the Governor had indicated in his 28 November 1844 letter to the Secretary of the Government in India to recommend that the replies amounted to a gratuitous cession to the East India Company , this understanding was not communicated to the Sultan and Temenggung . Similarly , the fact that Britain had not informed Johor about its decision to site the lighthouse on Pedra Branca might be seen either as recognition that Britain only had consent to build and operate it , or that Johor no longer had rights over the island . On the evidence adduced , the Court was unable to reach a conclusion on the issue . It also did not draw any conclusions about the construction and commissioning of the lighthouse , stating only that it saw the events as \" bearing on the issue of the evolving views of the authorities in Johor and Singapore about sovereignty over Pedra Branca / Pulau Batu Puteh \" . It noted , though , that apart from a two-day visit by the Temenggung and his followers to the island in early June 1850 , Johor had no involvement in the project . The Court declined to accept Malaysia 's argument that the Singapore Colonial Secretary 's query about the status of Pedra Branca in 1953 indicated that the United Kingdom had no conviction that the island was part of its territory . It felt the letter of inquiry showed the Singapore authorities were not clear about events that had occurred over a century earlier and that they were unsure their records were complete , which was understandable in the circumstances . It also disagreed that the Acting State Secretary of Johor , who had stated in his letter of reply that Johor did not claim ownership of the island , had acted without authority . The Johor Agreement was irrelevant \u2013 as the Colonial Secretary was a representative of the United Kingdom government which was not a foreign state in relation to Johor at the time , there was no question of the United Kingdom having to consent to Johor issuing the reply . The Federation of Malaya Agreement also did not assist Malaysia because the action of responding to a request for information was not an \" exercise \" of \" executive authority \" . Further , since Malaysia had not invoked this argument in its negotiations with Singapore and in the ICJ proceedings until late in the oral phase , Singapore was entitled to presume that the Acting State Secretary had acted within his authority . The meaning of the reply was clear \u2013 as of 1953 , Johor understood it did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca , and thus the Singapore authorities had no reason to doubt that the island belonged to the United Kingdom . The Court regarded as conduct \u00e0 titre de souverain Singapore 's investigation of six shipwrecks in the vicinity of Pedra Branca between 1920 and 1993 , its exclusive control over visits to the island , the installation of the military rebroadcast station on the island in 1977 , and the proposed reclamation of land around it . Malaysia was correct in asserting that the flying of an ensign was not normally a manifestation of sovereignty , and that the difference in size between Pulau Pisang and Pedra Branca had to be recognised . Nonetheless , some weight could be given to the fact that Malaysia had not requested for the Singapore ensign flying at Horsburgh Lighthouse to be taken down . The fact that Malaysia had referred to the lighthouse as a Singapore station in the 1959 and 1966 meteorological reports and had omitted it from the 1967 Malaysian report favoured Singapore 's case . The maps published by Malaysia between 1962 and 1975 tended to confirm that it considered Pedra Branca to fall under Singapore sovereignty . The \" ( SINGAPORE ) \" or \" ( SINGAPURA ) \" annotations on the maps in respect of the island were clear and supported Singapore 's case . The maps gave a good indication of Malaysia 's official position on the matter , and could amount to an admission . Finally , Malaysia could not rely on the disclaimers on the maps as the present matter did not concern a boundary but a distinct island . In any case , the maps were statements of geographical fact , particularly since Malaysia had itself produced and disseminated it against its own interest . In view of the above , the Court held that by 1980 sovereignty over Pedra Branca had passed from Malaysia to Singapore . = = = Sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge = = = None of the conduct by the United Kingdom and Singapore that led to the ICJ to conclude that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca applied to Middle Rocks . Since Johor held the ancient original title to Middle Rocks , the Court held that this title remains with Malaysia as the successor to the Johor Sultanate . South Ledge falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia , Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks . Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge , the Court had not been mandated to delimit the extent of the territorial waters of the two states in the area in question . Therefore , it simply held that South Ledge , as a low-tide elevation , belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located . = = Reactions and further developments = = = = = Reactions = = = On 23 May 2008 , Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim described the ICJ decision as creating a \" win-win \" situation and that both countries would \" forge ahead \" in their bilateral relationship . Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak called the judgment a \" balanced decision \" as Malaysia had been \" partly successful \" in its territorial claims . Interviewed by journalists at The Hague , Singapore Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar said : \" We are pleased with the judgment because the court has awarded sovereignty over Pedra Branca , which is the main feature in dispute , to Singapore . \" Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong said he was pleased with the result , and commented that bringing the dispute to the ICJ was \" a good way for [ Malaysia and Singapore ] to resolve disagreements or problems while maintaining good relations with each other \" . = = = = Malaysia = = = = On the day the ICJ released its judgment , Rais Yatim asserted that since South Ledge was within the territorial waters of Middle Rocks , \" Malaysia appears to be the sovereign holder \" . A week later , the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word Pulau ( \" Island \" ) for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as \" Batu Puteh \" or \" Pedra Branca \" . The ICJ 's decision is final and not subject to appeal . Nevertheless , in June 2008 Rais Yatim stated that Malaysia had renewed its search for the letter written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca . He noted that the rules of the ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced . In response , Singapore 's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would wait to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with . Several Malaysian Members of Parliament have urged the Federal Government to assert sovereignty over Pulau Pisang which also has a lighthouse on it that is operated by Singapore , or to take over administration of the lighthouse . Concerns were also expressed for Pulau Merambong near the western boundary of Malaysia and Singapore . The Menteri Besar of Johor , Abdul Ghani Othman , assured the public that Pulau Pisang belongs to Johor under a 1900 agreement between Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and British administrators in colonial Singapore . Nonetheless , Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands , reefs , rocks and other features in the South China Sea , Malacca Straits , and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China , Indonesia and Vietnam . Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border , and Pulau Perak to the west of Penang . At the opening of Johor 's 12th State Assembly in June 2008 , Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island \" whatever it takes \" . Speaking impromptu at the end of a prepared speech , the Sultan said in Malay : \" Let us be reminded that I do not forget Pulau Batu Puteh . Pulau Batu Puteh is not Singapore 's , but it belongs to Johor . It does not matter how long it may take , I will find the way to get back the island , which belongs to Johor . \" The Menteri Besar of Johor said the state government had \" clearly heard \" what the Sultan said , but did not elaborate . On 3 September 2008 , Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah , a Kelantan prince and MP from the state , sent a letter to Rais Yatim claiming that Johor 's interests had not been raised before the ICJ . He alleged that the seas surrounding Pedra Branca had always been in Johor 's hands and had never been surrendered to the British or to Singapore , and by accepting the ICJ decision and participating in technical discussions with Singapore the Malaysian government had infringed Johor 's constitutional rights . Responding , Rais said the letter seemed designed for \" political mileage \" and that Johor had been fully involved in the proceedings . He told the Straits Times , \" Everybody has his opinion on such matters but I , as Foreign Minister , have to abide by the dictate of the law . I have to see the letter first but it 's rather late in the day to express disappointment . \" = = = = Singapore = = = = On 21 July 2008 , in response to questions from Singapore Members of Parliament about Pedra Branca , the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Balaji Sadasivan stated that the maritime territory around the island included a territorial sea of up to 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) and an Exclusive Economic Zone . This was condemned by Malaysia 's Foreign Minister Rais Yatim as \" against the spirit of Asean and the legal structure \" as the claim was \" unacceptable and unreasonable and contradicts the principles of international law \" . In response , a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Singapore first stated its claim to a territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone on 15 September 1980 , and reiterated this claim on 23 May 2008 following the ICJ 's judgment . Both statements had made clear that if the limits of Singapore 's territorial sea or Exclusive Economic Zone overlapped with the claims of neighbouring countries , Singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law . In August 2008 , Rais said Malaysia took the view that Singapore was not entitled to claim an Exclusive Economic Zone around Pedra Branca as it considered that the maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island , that is , land inhabited by humans that had economic activity . At the launch of S. Jayakumar and Tommy Koh 's book Pedra Branca : The Road to the World Court on 19 December 2008 , Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong commented : \" The Pedra Branca case is likely to be a unique event in the history of Singapore as it is unlikely that Singapore will ever again need to seek confirmation of her title to territory under international law . \" = = = Resolution of outstanding issues = = = Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks , and to determine the ownership of South Ledge . Following a meeting on 3 June 2008 , the Committee agreed that a technical sub-committee would be established to oversee the conduct of joint survey works to prepare the way for talks on maritime issues in and around the area . If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge , either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved . Finally , both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters . In September 2008 , the Joint Technical Committee reported that its Sub-Committee on Joint Survey Works was finalising technical preparations for a hydrographic survey that would provide data for future delimitation discussions . A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed , and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond 0.5 nautical miles ( 0.9 km ; 0.6 mi ) off Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge . = = = Articles = = = Abdul Ghafur Hamid ( Khin Maung Sein ) ( 2011 ) , \" Case Concerning Sovereignty over Pulau Batu Puteh : A Critical Analysis of its Legal Implications \" , Malayan Law Journal 3 : 30 \u2013 61 .

With the exception of Delaware , every colony codified a general prohibition on private purchases of Native American lands without the consent of the government . Disputes were generally resolved by special interest legislation or war . Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut ( 1705 \u2013 73 ) , a lawsuit that proceeded for 70 years under special royal enabling acts only to be dismissed on non-substantive grounds , was the first and only judicial test of indigenous tenure . Aboriginal title remained a central political and economic issue and was listed as one of the enumerated grievances in the Declaration of Independence . Regardless , colonial land law relating to indigenous peoples became the foundation for aboriginal title in the United States during the Articles of Confederation-era and after the ratification of the United States Constitution . The colonial-law prohibition was codified at the federal level by the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783 and the Nonintercourse Acts of 1790 , 1793 , 1796 , 1799 , 1802 , and 1834 . Pre-Revolutionary land transactions remained the subject of political and legal disputes well after Independence . However , in sharp contrast to post-1790 transactions , no Indian tribe has yet succeeded in litigating or receiving compensation for a pre-1790 transaction . The prevailing view remains that the colonial governments , and the state governments that succeeded them during the Confederation era , had the power to authorize the alienation of indigenous lands within their borders . = = British law = = The British monarchy made two attempts to regulate aboriginal land transactions in British North America by Royal Proclamation : first , the Royal Proclamation of 1622 ; second , the Royal Proclamation of 1763 . = = Statutes by colony = = = = = Connecticut = = = The Connecticut Colony ( est . 1636 ) and the New Haven Colony ( est . 1637 ) merged in 1662 . = = = = Connecticut Colony = = = = In 1637 , the Connecticut Colony authorized a military expedition to Pequot lands to \u201c maynteine our right that God by Conquest hath given to us . \u201d Soon after , the colony decided to hold sachem 's liable for the trespass of any Indian . The conquered Pequot land 's were \u201c dispose [ d ] . . . with lest prejudice to others that may hereafter succeed them . \u201d The first prohibitions on transactions prohibited leases , either to or from Indians . The first prohibition on taking Indian property did not arise until 1660 . This was explicitly extended to land acquisitions in 1663 . The prohibition was strengthened in 1680 . The penalties were increased again in 1687 . \" Gold Hill \" was the first Indian reservation in the colony , established in 1659 and confirmed in 1678 . Indians were also explicitly permitted to use public lands for hunting . In other instances , the colony resolved land disputes between competing Indians . Other reservations were established for the Mohegans in New London in 1718 and others in 1726 ( which were exempted from the application of adverse possession ) , including the Pequot 's before 1731 . The power to purchase Indian lands was delegated to townships in 1702 . In 1706 , the colony offered amnesty for those who had purchased in violation of previous prohibitions as long as they provided a \" true account . \" In 1717 , the colony declared \u201c all lands in this government are holden of the King of Great Britain as the lord of the fee , \u201d barred the introduction of private purchases as evidence , and established a committee to \" settle this whole affair . \" Noting that the prohibition was among the most \" ancient laws \" of the colony , the fine was increased in 1722 , and treble damages were imposed . No compensation was provided in the case of eminent domain . = = = = New Haven = = = = Prior to merging with the Connecticut Colony , the New Haven Colony also prohibited private purchases of Indian lands unless \" in the name and for the use of the whole plantation . \u201d = = = Delaware = = = Delaware appears to have passed no laws concerning Indian lands . = = = Georgia = = = In 1758 , Georgia passed a prohibition of private purchases of Indian lands : [ I ] f any person or persons whosoever shall attempt to purchase or contract for , or cause to be purchased or contracted for , or shall take or acept of a grant or conveyance of any lands or tracts of lands from any Indian , or body of Indians , upon any prtence whatsoever , ( except for the use of the crown and that by permission for this purpose first had and obtained from his majesty , his heirs or successors , or his or their governor or commander in chief of the said province for the time being ) every such purchase , grant , contract and conveyance , shall be , and is and are hereby declared to be null and void , to all intentts an purposes whatsoever . . . . = = = Maryland = = = In 1639 Maryland codified separate prohibitions on land purchases from Indians and non-English Europeans , set to expire at the end of the next session of the general assembly ; the latter provided : Neither Shall [ a subject of the King ] obteine procure or accept of any Land within this Province from any Indian to his own or the use of any other than the Lord Proprietarie or his heirs [ , ] nor shall hold or possess and land . . . and upon pain that every person offending . . . Shall forfeit and lose to the Lord Proprietarie and his heirs all Such Lands so accepted or held without Grant of the Lord Proprietarie under him . This forfeiture provision was renewed in 1649 . Indian reservations were established in 1666 . Their boundaries were modified in 1698 , and enlarged in 1711 . Indian reservation boundaries were re-surveyed in 1721 . The Nanticoke reservation was extinguished in 1768 . Unlike many colonies , Maryland provided limited legal remedies for the violation of Indian property rights . In 1704 , the colony provided that non-Indians who took timber from Indian lands would be \u201c lyable to Action or Actions of trespass [ , ] And the persons grieved shall and may recover their Damages accordingly . \u201d It later authorized specific proceedings for \" Indian-English \" disputes ; in the third such authorization , jurisdiction was extended to \u201c punishing Trespasses committed on their Lands , \u201d claims arising from the renting of Indian lands , and \u201c Trespasses and Wastes on such of the said Indian Lands , which have not been granted to any of the Inhabitants of this Province . \" = = = Massachusetts = = = The Plymouth Colony ( est . 1620 ) and the Massachusetts Bay Colony ( est . 1628 ) merged in 1691 .

The law validated all titles in Martha 's Vineyard and the Island of Nantuckett and all other titles preceded by a grant from the colony . Henceforth , any violator would be subject to a fine of twice the value of the land and 6 months in prison . In 1719 , the Mashpee 's lands were exempted , and their sale was authorized in 1777 . In 1723 , the Hassanimscoe were exempted from property tax . In 1736 , they were granted a 6 miles square reservation , whose borders were amended several times in 1737 and 1739 . Indian lands within the township of Edgartown on Chappaquiddick were protected for 3 years in 1774 . = = = = Plymouth = = = = A 1643 Plymouth statute acknowledged the \u201c constant custome from our first beginning That no person or persons have or ever did purchase Rent or hire any lands . . . of the Natives but by the Majestrates consent \u201d and proscribed : [ I ] f any person or persons do hereafter purchase or rent or hyre and lands . . . of any of the Natives in any place within this government with the consent and assent of the Court Every such person or persons shall forfait [ fives times the value plus five pounds for every acre ] . In 1652 , the colony legislated an exception to this prohibition , for those who had failed to satisfy the conditions of their land grants resulting in the lands being re-granted to other non-Indians . The exception was only to last for 14 months from the end of the Court session , but was extended until June 1656 . The colony later retroactively validated some purchases made in violation of this prohibition . In 1660 , the prohibition was interpreted to apply to gifts of land . In 1663 , the prohibition was extended to mere use . In 1668 , the prohibition was extended to \" mount hope or Cawsumsett necke or any other neckes or tracts of land as there is a body of Indians upon \" ; as amended , the lands would be forfeited to the colony if the purchaser could not afford the fine . In 1674 , the colony established a one-year statute of limitations \" concerning Indian claimes that are or shalbe made to any lands within this Government ; which are now orderly possessed by the English those which doe lay claime to them shall orderly comence and prosecute theire claime as farr as hee or they are able ; wihtine one yeare after they be of age ; and noe longer and that care be taken that the Indians have notice of it . \" = = = = Massachusetts Bay = = = = The Massachusetts Bay colony codified its first prohibition on private purchases of Indian lands in 1634 : \u201c [ N ] oe person whatsoever shall buy any land of any Indean without leave from the Court . \u201d The first land recording law , instructed Steven Winthrope to record , inter alia , \u201c all the purchases of the natives . \u201d The Code of 1648 codified the prohibition such : \u201c It is ordered by Authoritie of this Court ; that no person whatsoever shall henceforth buy land of any Indian , without licence first had and obtained of the General Court : and if any shall offend heerin , such land so bought shall be forfeited to the Countrie . \u201d A 10-pounds-per-acre forfeiture was ordered in 1687 . In 1652 , the colony acknowledged aboriginal title , in a statute that made reference to several biblical verses : [ W ] hat lande any of the Indians , within this jurissdiction , have by possession or improvement , by subdueing of the same , they have just right thereunto , according to that Gen : 1 : 28 , chap : 9 : 1 , Psa . : 115 , 16 .

Only if the Indians were evicted from \u201c planting groundes or fishing places , \u201d were the Indians to \" have reliefe in any of the Courts of justice amongst the English , as the English have . \" In 1681 , the Dedham Indians were confined to the towns of Nanticke , Punkapauge. and Wamesti . In 1685 , the colony confirmed 5,800 acres of land to Indians in Marlborough and voided all deeds to the contrary . = = = New Hampshire = = = New Hampshire codified a rather weak prohibition against private purchases in 1641 : \u201c [ W ] hoever buys the Indian Ground by way of purchase is to tender it first to the town [ of Exeter ] before they are to make proper use of it in particular to themselves . \u201d In 1677 , the colony ordered the resettlement of the Piscataqua Indians . The colony 's instructions to Edmund Andros in 1686 included instructions to purchase Indian lands . New Hampshire codified a more serious prohibition in 1687 : [ H ] enceforth noe person or persons whatsoever Doe presume to tamper or treat with any Indian or Indians about the purchase sale or Confirmation of any Land or Lands whatseover within this his Majesties Territory and Dominion of the New England NOR from them or any of them take or receive any Deed or Sale Gift Mortgage Conveyance Lease Contract or Confirmation whatsoever without Leave or Lycense first had and obteyned from the Governour for the tyme being under his hand and Seale On peanlty of Forfeiture of [ 20 pounds per acre ] AND that all such \u2026 shall be utterly void and null .

In September 1683 , the colony codified a prohibition against private purchases : [ N ] o Person or Persons , shall presume to buy any Tract or Tracts of Land , of , or from the Indians within this Province , without special Order and Authority to him and them given by the Governor and Commissioners , or the major Part of them for the time being . Any purchase to the contrary would be \u201c null and void \u201d and subject to a fine of 5 shillings per acre . The prohibition was included in the colony 's instructions to Lord Cornbury . In 1703 , the prohibition was made more specific , to include \u201c Gift of Purchase in Fee , take a Mortuage or Lease for Life or number of Years \u201d ; the authorization method was changed to \u201c Certificate , under the hand of the Proprietors Recorder \u201d ; the fine was raised to 40 shillings per acre ; and the forfeiture provision was applied to \u201c Purchasers , their Heirs and Assigns shall forever hereafter be incapable to hold Plea for the said Land in any Court of Common Law or Equity . \u201d In 1758 , the colony appropriated for the Commissions \u201c such Sum and Sums of Money , as they may find necessary to purchase the Right and Claim of all or any of the Indian Natives of this Colony , to and for the Use of the Freeholders in this Colony , their Heirs and Assigns , for ever \u201d ; the maximum appropriation was to be 1600 pounds , no more than half of which was to go to the Delawares near Cranbury . As recounted by later , unrelated , judicial opinion : In 1758 the State of New Jersey purchased the Indian title to lands in that State , and as a consideration for the purchase , bought a tract of land as a residence for the Indians , having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State , any law or usage , or law then existing , to the contrary notwithstanding . The Indians , from the time of purchase , lived upon the land until the year 1801 , when they were authorized , by an act of the Legislature , to sell the land . = = = New York = = = The Director and Council of New Netherland passed a law holding citizens liable for damages to Indian crops in 1640 . In 1652 , the colony legislated to \" \u201c hereby dissolve , annul and make void all claimed or occupied purchases , sales , patents and deeds signed . \u201d Previous purchases were confirmed in 1670 . The General Assembly of New York codified a prohibition on private purchases of Indian lands in 1684 : [ H ] enceforward noe Purchase of Lands from the Indians shall bee esteemed a good Title without Leave first had and obtained from the Governour signed by a Warrant under his hand and Seale and entered on Record in the the Secretaries office att New Yorke and Satisfaction for the Purchase acknowliged by the Indians from whome the Purchase was made which is to bee Recorded likewise with purchase soe made and prosecuted and entered on Record in the office aforesaid shall from that time be Vallid to all intents and purposes . = = = North Carolina = = = North Carolina defined its boundaries with the Meherrin Indians in 1729 .

The statute was abrogated by the crown in 1683 , but re-enacted the same year . A similar law was passed in 1700 and supplemented in 1730 by more specific legislation ( and exempted from any statute of limitations ) . The colony passed legislation to clear title to all land grants from the colony in 1712 ; the act declared such grants \u201c free and clear , and freely and clearly acquitted and discharged , or otherwise well and sufficiently saved harmless and indemnified by the said proprietary , his heirs and assigns , of and from all Indian claims , and all other [ claims of non-Indians ] . \u201d In 1768 , the colony proscribed violations of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ; the punishment was to be \u201c death without the benefit of clergy . \u201d In 1769 , the punishment was set at a 500-pound fine , 1 year in prison without bail or mainprise , plus a moiety paid to the poor . = = = Rhode Island = = = Early Rhode Island laws restricted Indians from certain areas . Later laws were also passed in this vein . In 1651 , the colony passed its prohibition on private purchases of Indian lands : [ N ] o purchase shall be made of any Land of the natives for a plantation without the consent of this State , except it bee for the clearinge of the Indians from some particular planatations already sett down upon ; and if any shall so purchase , they shall forfeit the Land so purchased to the Collonie . . . . A 20-pound fine was added in 1658 . The wording of the prohibition was broadened and a 100-pound fine was added in 1727 . The colony repealed its prohibition on private purchases of Indian lands in 1759 . Certain sachems were prohibited from selling land in 1763 . A 1663 law purported to commemorate the \u201c surrender of [ the Narragansetts ] , their subjects and their lands \u201d to the protection of the King . The colony authorized the acquisition of certain Narragansett lands in 1672 . In 1696 and 1713 , laws were passed to void the purchases of various Narragansett lands .

Certain of these characteristics have been raised as an issue since the Court was established in 1789 . For its first 180 years , justices were almost always white male Protestants . Prior to the 20th century , a few Roman Catholics were appointed , but concerns about diversity of the Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity , to represent all geographic regions of the country , as opposed to ethnic , religious , or gender diversity . The 20th century saw the first appointment of a Jewish justice ( Louis Brandeis , 1916 ) , an African-American ( Thurgood Marshall , 1967 ) , an Italian-American ( Antonin Scalia , 1986 ) , and a woman ( Sandra Day O 'Connor , 1981 ) . The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice ( Sonia Sotomayor , 2009 ) if Benjamin Cardozo , 1932 , is excluded ( see the discussion below ) . In spite of the interest in the Court 's demographics and the symbolism accompanying the inevitably political appointment process , and the views of some commentators that no demographic considerations should arise in the selection process , the gender , race , educational background or religious views of the justices has played little role in their jurisprudence . For example , the opinions of the two African-American justices have reflected radically different judicial philosophies ; William Brennan and Antonin Scalia shared Catholic faith and a Harvard Law School education , but shared little in the way of jurisprudential philosophies . The court 's first two female justices voted together no more often than with their male colleagues , and historian Thomas R. Marshall writes that no particular \" female perspective \" can be discerned from their opinions . = = Geographic background = = For most of the existence of the Court , geographic diversity was a key concern of presidents in choosing justices to appoint . This was prompted in part by the early practice of Supreme Court justices also \" riding circuit \" \u2014 individually hearing cases in different regions of the country . In 1789 , the United States was divided into judicial circuits , and from that time until 1891 , Supreme Court justices also acted as judges within those individual circuits . George Washington was careful to make appointments \" with no two justices serving at the same time hailing from the same state \" . Abraham Lincoln broke with this tradition during the Civil War , and \" by the late 1880s presidents disregarded it with increasing frequency \" . Although the importance of regionalism declined , it still arose from time to time . For example , in appointing Benjamin Cardozo in 1929 , President Hoover was as concerned about the controversy over having three New York justices on the Court as he was about having two Jewish justices . David M. O 'Brien notes that \" [ f ] rom the appointment of John Rutledge from South Carolina in 1789 until the retirement of Hugo Black [ from Alabama ] in 1971 , with the exception of the Reconstruction decade of 1866 \u2013 1876 , there was always a southerner on the bench . Until 1867 , the sixth seat was reserved as the ' southern seat ' . Until Cardozo 's appointment in 1932 , the third seat was reserved for New Englanders . \" The westward expansion of the U.S. led to concerns that the western states should be represented on the Court as well , which purportedly prompted William Howard Taft to make his 1910 appointment of Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming . Geographic balance was sought in the 1970s , when Nixon attempted to employ a \" Southern strategy \" , hoping to secure support from Southern states by nominating judges from the region . Nixon unsuccessfully nominated Southerners Clement Haynsworth of South Carolina and G. Harrold Carswell of Georgia , before finally succeeding with the nomination of Harry Blackmun of Minnesota . The issue of regional diversity was again raised with the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens , who had been appointed from the midwestern Seventh Circuit , leaving the Court with all but one Justice having been appointed from states on the East Coast . As of 2014 , the Court has a majority from the Northeastern United States , with seven justices coming from states to the north and east of Washington , D.C. including four justices born or raised in New York City . The remaining two justices come from Georgia and California . Contemporary Justices may be associated with multiple states . Many nominees are appointed while serving in states or districts other than their hometown or home state . Chief Justice John Roberts , for example , was born in New York , but moved to Indiana at the age of five , where he grew up . After law school , Roberts worked in Washington , D.C. while living in Maryland . Thus , three states may claim his domicile . Despite the efforts to achieve geographic balance , nineteen states have never produced a Supreme Court Justice . Some states have been over-represented ( although partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed ) , with New York producing fifteen justices , Ohio producing ten , Massachusetts nine , Virginia eight , six each from Pennsylvania and Tennessee , and five from Kentucky , Maryland , and New Jersey . A handful of justices were born outside the United States , mostly from among the earliest justices on the Court . These included James Wilson , born in Fife , Scotland ; James Iredell , born in Lewes , England ; and William Paterson , born in County Antrim , Ireland . Justice David Josiah Brewer was born farthest from the U.S. , in Smyrna , in the Ottoman Empire , ( now \u0130zmir , Turkey ) . George Sutherland was born in Buckinghamshire , England . The last foreign-born Justice , and the only one of these for whom English was a second language , was Felix Frankfurter , born in Vienna , Austria . The Constitution imposes no citizenship requirement on federal judges . = = Ethnicity = = All Supreme Court justices were white and of European heritage until the appointment of Thurgood Marshall , the first African American Justice , in 1967 . Since then , only two other non-white Justices have been appointed , Marshall 's African-American successor , Clarence Thomas in 1991 , and Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 . = = = White justices = = = The vast majority of white justices have been of Northern European and Northwestern European descent . Up to the 1980s , only six justices of \" central , eastern , or southern European derivation \" had been appointed , of which five \" were of Germanic background , which includes Austrian , German-Bohemian , and Swiss origins ( John Catron , Samuel F. Miller , Louis Brandeis , Felix Frankfurter , and Warren Burger ) , while one justice was of Iberian descent ( Benjamin N. Cardozo ) . \" Justice Antonin Scalia ( appointed in 1986 ) and Justice Samuel Alito ( appointed in 2006 ) are the first justices of Italian descent to be appointed to the Supreme Court . Cardozo , appointed to the Court in 1932 , was the first Justice known to have non-northern European ancestry . = = = African American justices = = = No African-American candidate was given serious consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court until the election of John F. Kennedy , who weighed the possibility of appointing William H. Hastie of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit . Hastie had been the first African-American elevated to a Court of Appeals when Harry S. Truman had so appointed him in 1949 , and by the time of the Kennedy Administration , it was widely anticipated that Hastie might be appointed to the Supreme Court . That Kennedy gave serious consideration to making this appointment \" represented the first time in American history that an African American was an actual contender for the high court \" . The first African American appointed to the Court was Thurgood Marshall , appointed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 . The second was Clarence Thomas , appointed by George H. W. Bush to succeed Marshall in 1991 . Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark , saying that this was \" the right thing to do , the right time to do it , the right man and the right place . \" Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69 \u2013 11 on August 31 , 1967 . Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer , Doris Kearns Goodwin , that a lot of black baby boys would be named \" Thurgood \" in honor of this choice ( in fact , Kearns 's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson 's prophecy did not come true ) . Bush initially wanted to nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan , who stepped down in 1990 , but he then decided that Thomas had not yet had enough experience as a judge after only months on the federal bench . Bush therefore nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge David Souter instead . The selection of Thomas to instead replace Marshall preserved the existing racial composition of the court . = = = Hispanic and Latino justices = = = The words \" Latino \" and \" Hispanic \" are sometimes given distinct meanings , with \" Latino \" referring to persons of Latin American descent , and \" Hispanic \" referring to persons having an ancestry , language or culture traceable to Spain or to the Iberian Peninsula as a whole , although the term \" Lusitanic \" usually refers to persons having an ancestry , language or culture traceable to Portugal specifically . Sonia Sotomayor \u2014 nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26 , 2009 , and sworn in on August 8 \u2014 is the first Supreme Court Justice of Latin American descent . Born in New York City of Puerto Rican parents , she has been known to refer to herself as a \" Nuyorican \" . Sotomayor is also generally regarded as the first Hispanic justice , although some sources claim that this distinction belongs to former Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo . It has been claimed that \" only since the George H. W. Bush administration have Hispanic candidates received serious consideration from presidents in the selection process \" , and that Emilio M. Garza ( considered for the vacancy eventually given to Clarence Thomas ) was the first Hispanic judge for whom such an appointment was contemplated . Subsequently , Bill Clinton was reported by several sources to have considered Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes for a Supreme Court nomination on both occasions when a Court vacancy opened during the Clinton presidency . The possibility of a Hispanic Justice returned during the George W. Bush Presidency , with various reports suggesting that Emilio Garza , Alberto Gonzales , and Consuelo M. Callahan were under consideration for the vacancy left by the retirement of Sandra Day O 'Connor . O 'Connor 's seat eventually went to Samuel Alito , however . Speculation about a Hispanic nomination arose again after the election of Barack Obama . In 2009 , Obama appointed Sonia Sotomayor , a woman of Puerto Rican descent , to be the first unequivocally Hispanic Justice . Both the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and the Hispanic National Bar Association count Sotomayor as the first Hispanic justice . Some historians contend that Cardozo \u2014 a Sephardic Jew believed to be of distant Portuguese descent \u2014 should also be counted as the first Hispanic Justice . Schmidhauser wrote in 1979 that \" [ a ] mong the large ethnic groupings of European origin which have never been represented upon the Supreme Court are the Italians , Southern Slavs , and Hispanic Americans . \" The National Hispanic Center for Advanced Studies and Policy Analysis wrote in 1982 that the Supreme Court \" has never had an Hispanic Justice \" , and the Hispanic American Almanac similarly reported in 1996 that \" no Hispanic has yet sat on the U.S. Supreme Court \" . However , Segal and Spaeth state : \" Though it is often claimed that no Hispanics have served on the Court , it is not clear why Benjamin Cardozo , a Sephardic Jew of Spanish heritage , should not count . \" They identify a number of other sources that present conflicting views as to Cardozo 's ethnicity , with one simply labeling him \" Iberian . \" In 2007 , the Dictionary of Latino Civil Rights History also listed Cardozo as \" the first Hispanic named to the Supreme Court of the United States . \" The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor , widely described in media accounts as the first Hispanic nominee , drew more attention to the question of Cardozo 's ethnicity . Cardozo biographer Andrew Kaufman questioned the usage of the term \" hispanic \" during Cardozo 's lifetime , commenting : \" Well , I think he regarded himself as Sephardic Jew whose ancestors came from the Iberian Peninsula . \" However , \" no one has ever firmly established that the family 's roots were , in fact , in Portugal \" . It has also been asserted that Cardozo himself \" confessed in 1937 that his family preserved neither the Spanish language nor Iberian cultural traditions \" . By contrast , Cardozo made his own translations of authoritative legal works written in French and German . = = = Ethnic groups that have never been represented = = = Many ethnic groups have never been represented on the Court . There has never been a Justice with any Asian , Native American , or Pacific Islander heritage , and no person having such a heritage was publicly considered for an appointment until the 21st century . Legal scholar Viet D. Dinh , of Vietnamese descent , was named as a potential George W. Bush nominee . During the presidency of Barack Obama , potential nominees have included Harold Hongju Koh , of Korean descent , and former Idaho attorney general Larry EchoHawk , a member of the Pawnee tribe . = = = Public opinion on ethnic diversity = = = Public opinion about ethnic diversity on the court \" varies widely depending on the poll question 's wording \" . For example , in two polls taken in 1991 , one resulted in half of respondents agreeing that it was \" important that there always be at least one black person \" on the Court while the other had only 20 % agreeing with that sentiment , and with 77 % agreeing that \" race should never be a factor in choosing Supreme Court justices \" . It is claimed that the Presidents who have appointed Justices to the Supreme Court in recent years have taken race and religion into account , causing it to be unrepresentative of the U.S. population in general . At the current time , no white Protestant serves on the Court , despite the fact that white Protestants are the largest single demographic group in the United States . = = Gender = = Of the 112 justices , 108 ( 96.4 % ) have been men . All Supreme Court justices were males until 1981 , when Ronald Reagan fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise to place a woman on the Court , which he did with the appointment of Sandra Day O 'Connor . O 'Connor was later joined on the Court by Ruth Bader Ginsburg , appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993 . After O 'Connor retired in 2006 , Ginsburg would be joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , who were successfully appointed to the Court in 2009 and 2010 , respectively , by Barack Obama . The only other woman to be nominated to the Court was Harriet Miers , whose nomination to succeed O 'Connor by George W. Bush was withdrawn under fire . Substantial public sentiment in support of appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court has been expressed since at least as early as 1930 , when an editorial in the Christian Science Monitor encouraged Herbert Hoover to consider Ohio justice Florence E. Allen or assistant attorney general Mabel Walker Willebrandt . Franklin Delano Roosevelt later appointed Allen to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit \u2014 making her \" one of the highest ranking female jurists in the world at that time \" . However , neither Roosevelt nor his successors over the following two decades gave strong consideration to female candidates for the Court . Harry Truman considered such an appointment , but was dissuaded by concerns raised by justices then serving that a woman on the Court \" would inhibit their conference deliberations \" , which were marked by informality . President Richard Nixon named Mildred Lillie , then serving on the Second District Court of Appeal of California , as a potential nominee to fill one of two vacancies on the Court in 1971 . However , Lillie was quickly deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association , and no formal proceedings were ever set with respect to her potential nomination . Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist were then successfully nominated to fill those vacancies . = = = Public opinion on gender diversity = = = In 1991 , a poll found that 53 % of Americans felt it \" important that there always be at least one woman \" on the Court . However , when O 'Connor stepped down from the court , leaving Justice Ginsburg as the lone remaining woman , only one in seven persons polled found it \" essential that a woman be nominated to replace \" O 'Connor . = = Marital status and sexual orientation = = = = = Marital status = = = All but a handful of Supreme Court justices have been married . Frank Murphy , Benjamin Cardozo , and James McReynolds were all lifelong bachelors . In addition , retired justice David Souter and current justice Elena Kagan have never been married . William O. Douglas was the first Justice to divorce while on the Court , and also had the most marriages of any Justice , with four . Justice John Paul Stevens divorced his first wife in 1979 , marrying his second wife later that year . Sonia Sotomayor was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman , having divorced in 1983 , long before her nomination in 2009 . Several justices have become widowers while on the bench . The 1792 death of Elizabeth Rutledge , wife of Justice John Rutledge , contributed to the mental health problems that led to the rejection of his recess appointment . Roger B. Taney survived his wife , Anne , by twenty years . Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. resolutely continued working on the Court for several years after the death of his wife . William Rehnquist was a widower for the last fourteen years of his service on the Court , his wife Natalie having died on October 17 , 1991 after suffering from ovarian cancer . With the death of Martin D. Ginsburg in June 2010 , Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the first woman to be widowed while serving on the Court . = = = Sexual orientation = = = With regards to sexual orientation , no Supreme Court justice has identified himself or herself as anything other than heterosexual , and no incontrovertible evidence of a justice having any other sexual orientation has ever been uncovered . However , the personal lives of several justices and nominees have attracted speculation . G. Harrold Carswell was unsuccessfully nominated by Richard Nixon in 1970 , and was convicted in 1976 of battery for making an \" unnatural and lascivious \" advance to a male police officer working undercover in a Florida men 's room . Some therefore claim him as the only gay or bisexual person nominated to the Court thus far . If so , it is unlikely that Nixon was aware of it ; White House Counsel John Dean later wrote of Carswell that \" [ w ] hile Richard Nixon was always looking for historical firsts , nominating a homosexual to the high court would not have been on his list \" . Speculation has been recorded about the sexual orientation of a few justices who were lifelong bachelors , but no unambiguous evidence exists that they were gay . Perhaps the greatest body of circumstantial evidence surrounds Frank Murphy , who was dogged by \" [ r ] umors of homosexuality [ ... ] all his adult life \" . For more than 40 years , Edward G. Kemp was Frank Murphy 's devoted , trusted companion . Like Murphy , Kemp was a lifelong bachelor . From college until Murphy 's death , the pair found creative ways to work and live together . [ ... ] When Murphy appeared to have the better future in politics , Kemp stepped into a supportive , secondary role . As well as Murphy 's close relationship with Kemp , Murphy 's biographer , historian Sidney Fine , found in Murphy 's personal papers a letter that \" if the words mean what they say , refers to a homosexual encounter some years earlier between Murphy and the writer . \" However , the letter 's veracity cannot be confirmed and a review of all the evidence led Fine to conclude that he \" could not stick his neck out and say [ Murphy ] was gay \" . Speculation has also surrounded Benjamin Cardozo , whose celibacy suggests repressed homosexuality or asexuality . The fact that he was unmarried and was personally tutored by the writer Horatio Alger ( alleged to have had sexual relations with boys ) led some of Cardozo 's biographers to insinuate that Cardozo was homosexual , but no real evidence exists to corroborate this possibility . Constitutional law scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in a New York Times Book Review of Richard Polenberg 's book on Cardozo : Polenberg describes Cardozo 's lifelong devotion to his older sister Nell , with whom he lived in New York until her death in 1929 . When asked why he had never married , Cardozo replied , quietly and sadly , I never could give Nellie the second place in my life . Polenberg suggests that friends may have stressed Cardozo 's devotion to his sister to discourage rumors that he was sexually dysfunctional , or had an unusually low sexual drive or was homosexual . But he produces no evidence to support any of these possibilities , except to note that friends , in describing Cardozo , used words like beautiful , exquisite , sensitive or delicate . Andrew Kaufman , author of Cardozo , a biography published in 2000 , notes that \" Although one cannot be absolutely certain , it seems highly likely that Cardozo lived a celibate life \" . Judge Learned Hand is quoted in the book as saying about Cardozo : \" He [ had ] no trace of homosexuality anyway \" . More recently , when David Souter was nominated to the Court , \" conservative groups expressed concern to the White House ... that the president 's bachelor nominee might conceivably be a homosexual \" . Similar questions were raised regarding the sexual orientation of unmarried nominee Elena Kagan . However , no evidence was ever produced regarding Souter 's sexual orientation , and Kagan 's apparent heterosexuality was attested by colleagues familiar with her dating history . = = Religion = = When the Supreme Court was established in 1789 , the first members came from among the ranks of the Founding Fathers and were almost uniformly Protestant . Of the 112 justices who have been appointed to the court , 91 have been from various Protestant denominations , 12 have been Catholics ( one other justice , Sherman Minton , converted to Catholicism after leaving the Court ) , eight have been Jewish and one , David Davis , had no known religious affiliation . Three of the 17 chief justices have been Catholics , and one Jewish justice , Abe Fortas , was unsuccessfully nominated to be chief justice . The table below shows the religious affiliation of each of the justices sitting as of February 2016 : = = = Protestant justices = = = Most Supreme Court justices have been Protestant Christians . These have included 33 Episcopalians , 18 Presbyterians , nine Unitarians , five Methodists , three Baptists , and lone representatives of various other denominations . William Rehnquist was the Court 's only Lutheran . Noah Swayne was a Quaker . Some 15 Protestant justices did not adhere to a particular denomination . Baptist denominations and other evangelical churches have been underrepresented on the Court , relative to the population of the United States . Conversely , mainline Protestant churches historically were overrepresented . Following the retirement of John Paul Stevens in June 2010 , the Court had an entirely non-Protestant composition for the first time in its history . = = = Catholic justices = = = The first Catholic justice , Roger B. Taney , was appointed chief justice in 1836 by Andrew Jackson . The second , Edward Douglass White , was appointed as an associate justice in 1894 , but also went on to become chief justice . Joseph McKenna was appointed in 1898 , placing two Catholics on the Court until White 's death in 1921 . This period marked the beginning of an inconsistently observed \" tradition \" of having a \" Catholic seat \" on the court . Other Catholic justices included Pierce Butler ( appointed 1923 ) and Frank Murphy ( appointed 1940 ) . Sherman Minton , appointed in 1949 , was a Protestant during his time on the Court . To some , however , his wife 's Catholic faith implied a \" Catholic seat \" . Minton joined his wife 's church in 1961 , five years after he retired from the Court . Minton was succeeded by a Catholic , however , when President Eisenhower appointed William J. Brennan to that seat . Eisenhower sought a Catholic to appoint to the Court \u2014 in part because there had been no Catholic justice since Murphy 's death in 1949 , and in part because Eisenhower was directly lobbied by Cardinal Francis Spellman of the Archdiocese of New York to make such an appointment . Brennan was then the lone Catholic justice until the appointment of Antonin Scalia in 1986 , and Anthony Kennedy in 1988 . Like Sherman Minton , Clarence Thomas was not a Catholic at the time he was appointed to the Court . Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College , a Roman Catholic seminary , but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage . At some point in the late 1990s , Thomas returned to Catholicism . In 2005 , John Roberts became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the Court . Shortly thereafter , Samuel Alito became the fifth on the Court , and the eleventh in the history of the Court . Alito 's appointment gave the Court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history . Besides Thomas , at least one other Justice , James F. Byrnes , was raised as a Roman Catholic , but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the Court . In contrast to historical patterns , the Court has gone from having a \" Catholic seat \" to being what some have characterized as a \" Catholic court . \" The reasons for that are subject to debate , and are a matter of intense public scrutiny . That the majority of the Court is now Catholic , and that the appointment of Catholics has become accepted , represents a historical ' sea change . ' It has fostered accusations that the court has become \" a Catholic boys club \" ( particularly as the Catholics chosen tend to be politically conservative ) and calls for non-Catholics to be nominated . In May 2009 , President Barack Obama nominated a Catholic woman , Sonia Sotomayor , to replace retiring Justice David Souter . Her confirmation raised the number of Catholics on the Court to six , compared to three non-Catholics ( all Jewish ) . With Antonin Scalia 's death in February 2016 , the number of Catholic Justices went back to five . All of the Catholic justices have been members of the \" Roman \" ( Latin ) rite within the Catholic Church . = = = Jewish justices = = = In 1853 , President Millard Fillmore offered to appoint Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin to be the first Jewish justice , and the New York Times reported ( on February 15 , 1853 ) that \" if the President nominates Benjamin , the Democrats are determined to confirm him \" . However , Benjamin declined the offer , and ultimately became Secretary of State for the Confederacy during the Civil War . The first Jewish nominee , Louis Brandeis , was appointed in 1916 , after a tumultuous hearing process . The 1932 appointment of Benjamin Cardozo raised mild controversy for placing two Jewish justices on the Court at the same time , although the appointment was widely lauded based on Cardozo 's qualifications , and the Senate was unanimous in confirming Cardozo . Brandeis was succeeded by Protestant William O. Douglas , but Cardozo was succeeded by another Jewish Justice , Felix Frankfurter . Negative reaction to the appointment of the early Jewish justices did not exclusively come from outside the Court . Justice James Clark McReynolds , a blatant anti-semite , refused to speak to Brandeis for three years following the latter 's appointment and when Brandeis retired in 1939 , did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to Court members on their retirement . During Benjamin Cardozo 's swearing in ceremony McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper muttering \" another one \" and did not attend that of Felix Frankfurter , exclaiming \" My God , another Jew on the Court ! \" Frankfurter was followed by Arthur Goldberg and Abe Fortas , each of whom filled what became known as the \" Jewish Seat \" . After Fortas resigned in 1969 , he was replaced by Protestant Harry Blackmun . No Jewish justices were nominated thereafter until Ronald Reagan nominated Douglas H. Ginsburg in 1987 , to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Lewis F. Powell ; however , this nomination was withdrawn , and the Court remained without any Jewish justices until 1993 , when Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( unrelated to Douglas Ginsburg ) was appointed to replace Byron White . Ginsburg was followed in relatively quick succession by the appointment of Stephen Breyer , also Jewish , in 1994 to replace Harry Blackmun . In 2010 , the confirmation of President Barack Obama 's nomination of Elena Kagan to the Court ensured that three Jewish justices would serve simultaneously . Prior to this confirmation , conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan stated that , \" If Kagan is confirmed , Jews , who represent less than 2 percent of the U.S. population , will have 33 percent of the Supreme Court seats \" . At the time of his remarks , 6.4 percent of justices had been Jewish in the history of the court . On March 16 , 2016 , President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia . = = = The shift to a Catholic majority , and non-Protestant Court = = = At the time of Breyer 's appointment in 1994 , there were two Roman Catholic justices , Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy , and two Jewish justices , Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg . Clarence Thomas , who had been raised as a Roman Catholic but had attended an Episcopal church after his marriage , returned to Catholicism later in the 1990s . At this point , the four remaining Protestant justices \u2014 Rehnquist , Stevens , O 'Connor , and Souter \u2014 remained a plurality on the Court , but for the first time in the history of the Court , Protestants were no longer an absolute majority . The first Catholic plurality on the Court occurred in 2005 , when Chief Justice Rehnquist was succeeded in office by Chief Justice John Roberts , who became the fourth sitting Catholic justice . On January 31 , 2006 , Samuel Alito became the fifth sitting Catholic justice , and on August 6 , 2009 , Sonia Sotomayor became the sixth . By contrast , there has been only one Catholic U.S. President , John F. Kennedy ( unrelated to Justice Kennedy ) , and one Catholic U.S. Vice President , Joe Biden , and there has never been a Jewish U.S. President or Vice President . At the beginning of 2010 , Justice John Paul Stevens was the sole remaining Protestant on the Court . In April 2010 , Justice Stevens announced his retirement , effective as of the Court 's 2010 summer recess . Upon Justice Stevens ' retirement , which formally began on June 28 , 2010 , the Court lacked a Protestant member , marking the first time in its history that it was exclusively composed of Jewish and Catholic justices . This development has led to some comment . Law school professor Jeffrey Rosen wrote that \" it 's a fascinating truth that we 've allowed religion to drop out of consideration on the Supreme Court , and right now , we have a Supreme Court that religiously at least , by no means looks like America \" . = = = Religions that have never been represented = = = A number of sizable religious groups , each less than 2 % of the U.S. population , have had no members appointed as justices . These include Orthodox Christians , Mormons , Pentecostals , Muslims , Hindus , Buddhists , and Sikhs . George Sutherland has been described as a \" lapsed Mormon \" because he was raised in the LDS Church , his parents having immigrated to the United States during Sutherland 's infancy to join that church . Sutherland 's parents soon left the LDS Church and moved to Montana . Sutherland himself also disaffiliated with the faith , but remained in Utah and graduated from Brigham Young Academy in 1881 , the only non-Mormon in his class . In 1975 , Attorney General Edward H. Levi had listed Dallin H. Oaks , a Mormon who had clerked for Earl Warren and was then president of Brigham Young University , as a potential nominee for Gerald Ford . Ford \" crossed Oaks 's name off the list early on , noting in the margin that a member of the LDS Church might bring a ' confirmation fight ' \" . No professing atheist has ever been appointed to the Court , although some justices have declined to engage in religious activity , or affiliate with a denomination . As an adult , Benjamin Cardozo no longer practiced his faith and identified himself as an agnostic , though he remained proud of his Jewish heritage . = = Age = = Unlike the offices of President , U.S. Representative , and U.S. Senator , there is no minimum age for Supreme Court justices set forth in the United States Constitution . However , justices tend to be appointed after having made significant achievements in law or politics , which excludes many young potential candidates from consideration . At the same time , justices appointed at too advanced an age will likely have short tenures on the Court . The youngest justice ever appointed was Joseph Story , 32 at the time of his appointment in 1812 ; the oldest was Charles Evans Hughes , who was 67 at the time of his appointment as Chief Justice in 1930 . ( Hughes had previously been appointed to the Court as an associate justice in 1910 , at the age of 48 , but had resigned in 1916 to run for president ) . Story went on to serve for 33 years , while Hughes served 11 years after his second appointment . The oldest justice at the time of his initial appointment was Horace Lurton , 65 at the time of his appointment in 1909 . Lurton died after only four years on the Court . The oldest sitting justice to be elevated to Chief Justice was Hughes ' successor , Harlan Fiske Stone , who was 68 at the time of his elevation in 1941 . Stone died in 1946 , only five years after his elevation . The oldest nominee to the court was South Carolina senator William Smith , nominated in 1837 , then aged around 75 ( it is known that he was born in 1762 , but not the exact date ) . The Senate confirmed Smith 's nomination by a vote of 23 \u2013 18 , but Smith declined to serve . Of the justices currently sitting , the youngest at time of appointment was Clarence Thomas , who was 43 years old at the time of his confirmation in 1991 . As of the beginning of the 2014 \u2013 15 term , Elena Kagan was the youngest justice sitting , at 54 years of age . The oldest person to have served on the Court was Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . , who stepped down two months shy of his 91st birthday . John Paul Stevens , second only to Holmes , left the court in June 2010 , two months after turning 90 . The average age of the Court as a whole fluctuates over time with the departure of older justices and the appointment of younger people to fill their seats . The average age of the Court is 70 years , 7 months . Just prior to the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist in September 2005 , the average age was 71 . After Sonia Sotomayor was appointed in August 2009 , the average age at which current justices were appointed was about 53 years old . The longest period of time in which one group of justices has served together occurred from August 3 , 1994 , when Stephen Breyer was appointed to replace the retired Harry Blackmun , to September 3 , 2005 , the death of Rehnquist , totaling 11 years and 31 days . From 1789 until 1970 , justices served an average of 14.9 years . Those who have stepped down since 1970 have served an average of 25.6 years . The retirement age had jumped from an average of 68 pre-1970 to 79 for justices retiring post-1970 . Between 1789 and 1970 there was a vacancy on the Court once every 1.91 years . In the next 34 years since the two appointments in 1971 , there was a vacancy on average only once every 3.75 years . The typical one-term president has had one appointment opportunity instead of two . Commentators have noted that advances in medical knowledge \" have enormously increased the life expectancy of a mature person of an age likely to be considered for appointment to the Supreme Court \" . Combined with the reduction in responsibilities carried out by modern justices as compared to the early justices , this results in much longer potential terms of service . This has led to proposals such as imposing a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices and predetermined term limits . = = Educational background = = Although the Constitution imposes no educational background requirements for federal judges , the work of the Court involves complex questions of law \u2014 ranging from constitutional law to administrative law to admiralty law \u2014 and consequently , a legal education has become a de facto prerequisite to appointment on the Supreme Court . Every person who has been nominated to the Court has been an attorney . Before the advent of modern law schools in the United States , justices , like most attorneys of the time , completed their legal studies by \" reading law \" ( studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys ) rather than attending a formal program . The first justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury , appointed to the Court in 1846 . Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield , Connecticut , the most prestigious law school in the United States in that day , prior to his admission to the bar in 1812 . However , Woodbury did not earn a law degree . Woodbury 's successor on the Court , Benjamin Robbins Curtis , who received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1832 , and was appointed to the Court in 1851 , was the first Justice to bear such a credential . Associate Justice James F. Byrnes , whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942 , was the last justice without a law degree to be appointed ; Stanley Forman Reed , who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957 , was the last sitting justice from such a background . In total , of the 112 justices appointed to the Court , 47 have had law degrees , an additional 18 attended some law school but did not receive a degree , and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance . The table below shows the college and law school from which each of the justices sitting as of February 2015 graduated : = = Professional background = = Not only have all justices been attorneys , nearly two thirds had previously been judges . As of 2010 , eight of the nine sitting justices previously served as judges of the United States Courts of Appeals , while the most recent appointment , Justice Elena Kagan , served as Solicitor General , the attorney responsible for representing the federal government in cases before the Court . Few justices have a background as criminal defense lawyers , and Thurgood Marshall is reportedly the last justice to have had a client in a death penalty case . Historically , justices have come from some tradition of public service ; only George Shiras , Jr. had no such experience . Relatively few justices have been appointed from among members of Congress . Six were members of the United States Senate at the time of their appointment , while one was a sitting member of the House of Representatives . Six more had previously served in the Senate . Three have been sitting governors . Only one , William Howard Taft , had been President of the United States . The last justice to have held elected office was Sandra Day O 'Connor , who was elected twice to the Arizona State Senate after being appointed there by the governor . = = Financial means = = The financial position of the typical Supreme Court Justice has been described as \" upper-middle to high social status : reared in nonrural but not necessarily urban environment , member of a civic-minded , politically active , economically comfortable family \" . Charles A. Beard , in his An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States , profiled those among the justices who were also drafters of the Constitution . James Wilson , Beard notes , \" developed a lucrative practice at Carlisle \" before becoming \" one of the directors of the Bank of North America on its incorporation in 1781 \" . A member of the Georgia Land Company , Wilson \" held shares to the amount of at least one million acres \" . John Blair was \" one of the most respectable men in Virginia , both on account of his Family as well as fortune \" . Another source notes that Blair \" was a member of a prominent Virginia family . His father served on the Virginia Council and was for a time acting Royal governor . His granduncle , James Blair , was founder and first president of the College of William and Mary . \" John Rutledge was elected Governor of South Carolina at a time when the Constitution of that state set , as a qualification for the office , ownership of \" a settled plantation or freehold ... of the value of at least ten thousand pounds currency , clear of debt \" . Oliver Ellsworth \" rose rapidly to wealth and power in the bar of his native state \" with \" earnings ... unrivalled in his own day and unexampled in the history of the colony \" , developing \" a fortune which for the times and the country was quite uncommonly large \" . Bushrod Washington was the nephew of George Washington , who was at the time of the younger Washington 's appointment the immediate past President of the United States and one of the wealthiest men in the country . \" About three-fifths of those named to the Supreme Court personally knew the President who nominated them \" . There have been exceptions to the typical portrait of justices growing up middle class or wealthy . For example , the family of Sherman Minton went through a period of impoverishment during his childhood , resulting from the disability of his father due to a heat stroke . In 2008 , seven of the nine sitting justices were millionaires , and the remaining two were close to that level of wealth . Historian Howard Zinn , in his 1980 book A People 's History of the United States , argues that the justices cannot be neutral in matters between rich and poor , as they are almost always from the upper class . Chief Justice Roberts is the son of an executive with Bethlehem Steel ; Justice Stevens was born into a wealthy Chicago family ; and Justices Kennedy and Breyer both had fathers who were successful attorneys . Justices Alito and Scalia both had educated ( and education-minded ) parents : Scalia 's father was a highly educated college professor and Alito 's father was a high school teacher before becoming \" a long-time employee of the New Jersey state legislature \" . Only Justices Thomas and Sotomayor have been regarded as coming from a lower-class background . One authority states that \" Thomas grew up in poverty . The Pin Point community he lived in lacked a sewage system and paved roads . Its inhabitants dwelled in destitution and earned but a few cents each day performing manual labor \" . The depth of Thomas ' poverty has been disputed by suggestions of \" ample evidence to suggest that Thomas enjoyed , by and large , a middle-class upbringing \" . = = = Financial disclosures = = = Beginning in 1979 , the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 required federal officials , including the justices , to file annual disclosures of their income and assets . These disclosures provide a snapshot into the wealth of the justices , reported within broad ranges , from year to year since 1979 . In the first such set of disclosures , only two justices were revealed to be millionaires : Potter Stewart and Lewis F. Powell , with Chief Justice Warren Burger coming in third with about $ 600,000 in holdings . The least wealthy Justice was Thurgood Marshall . The 1982 report disclosed that newly appointed Justice Sandra Day O 'Connor was a millionaire , and the second-wealthiest Justice on the Court ( after Powell ) . The remaining justices listed assets in the range of tens of thousands to a few hundred-thousand , with the exception of Thurgood Marshall , who \" reported no assets or investment income of more than $ 100 \" . The 1985 report had the justices in relatively the same positions , while the 1992 report had O 'Connor as the wealthiest member of the Court , with Stevens being the only other millionaire , most other justices reporting assets averaging around a half million dollars , and the two newest justices , Clarence Thomas and David Souter , reporting assets of at least $ 65,000 . ( In 2011 , however , it was revealed that Thomas had misstated his income going back to at least 1989 . ) The 2007 report was the first to reflect the holdings of John Roberts and Samuel Alito . Disclosures for that year indicated that Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy were the only justices who were clearly not millionaires , although Thomas was reported to have signed a book deal worth over one million dollars . Other justices reported holdings within the following ranges : The financial disclosures indicate that many of the justices have substantial stock holdings . This , in turn , has affected the business of the Court , as these holdings have led justices to recuse themselves from cases , occasionally with substantial impact . For example , in 2008 , the recusal of John Roberts in one case , and Samuel Alito in another , resulted in each ending in a 4-4 split , which does not create a binding precedent . The Court was unable to decide another case in 2008 because four of the nine justices had conflicts , three arising from stock ownership in affected companies .",

                    "text": "Langit Makin Mendung = \" Langit Makin Mendung \" ( \" The Sky is Increasingly Cloudy \" ) is a controversial Indonesian short story . Published in Sastra magazine under the pen name Kipandjikusmin in August 1968 , it tells the story of Muhammad descending to Earth with the angel Gabriel to investigate the decreasing number of Muslims entering heaven , only to find that Muslims in Indonesia have begun fornicating , drinking alcohol , waging war on Muslims , and otherwise going against the tenets of Islam because of nasakom , a government policy during Sukarno 's administration that combined nationalism , religion , and communism . Unable to do anything to stop the rampant sinning , Muhammad and Gabriel watch the political maneuvering , crime , and famine in Jakarta in the form of eagles . Upon publication , \" Langit Makin Mendung \" drew heavy criticism for its depictions of Allah , Muhammad , and Gabriel . Sastra was banned in North Sumatra , and the magazine 's offices in Jakarta were attacked . Despite published apologies from the writer and publisher , the head editor of Sastra , HB Jassin , was tried for blasphemy ; he was later sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence . Critical views of the story vary ; the story has been compared to Dante 's Divine Comedy for its depiction of a man on a spiritual quest with a spiritual companion , yet criticized for depicting Allah , Muhammad , and Gabriel in a negative light . The legal case itself has been subject to debate , with both sides arguing freedom of expression and the scope of imagination . = = Background = = Indonesia is the world 's largest majority-Muslim country . This has had a large influence on the development of Indonesia , both in its national revolution and in modern times . However , it has been used to justify and promote political positions . The Dutch colonial government minimized the role of the religious leaders , the kyai and ulama , in an attempt to prevent them using their influence to lead resistance . Modern rulers have used it to \" maintain the status quo \" , while those pushing for change use Islam as a means for justice or other political ends . This has led to a general fragmentation . During the early 1960s then-President Sukarno declared a new state ideology of Nasakom , which stood for Nasionalisme , Agama , dan Komunisme ( Nationalism , Religion , and Communism ) , which would complement the existing policy of Pancasila . This declaration , viewed as proof of increasing Indonesian Communist Party ( Partai Komunis Indonesia , or PKI ) power , led to conflict between the PKI and the military . In the midst of an escalating confrontation with Malaysia ( 1963 \u2013 1966 ) , Sukarno demoted General Abdul Haris Nasution , Commander of the Army , and promoted Ahmad Yani , while the PKI spread rumours that a CIA-sponsored board of generals ( Dewan Jenderal ) were plotting against the government , using the Gilchrist Document as proof . Eventually , a coup on 30 September 1965 , thought to have been sponsored by the PKI , killed six generals , leading to the massacre of suspected communists and the fall of Sukarno 's government over the next two years . = = Plot = = Muhammad and the other prophets of Islam , bored of living in jannah ( heaven ) and weary of singing the praises of Allah , request permission to return to Earth . Disappointed by the prophets ' request , Allah calls on Muhammad to explain why he wishes to return , as Allah had already granted him many things . Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research , to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven . Allah , after removing his glasses , responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno 's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further . After much fanfare , Muhammad departs jannah 's airport , riding a buraq , or winged horse . The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him . On the way , they encounter a Soviet spacecraft . Hearing that they are infidels , Muhammad approaches to investigate , only to crash into the spacecraft , obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts ; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud . Later , they pass Jakarta , which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth . Angered by Gabriel 's statement that less than a million of Indonesia 's 90 million Muslims are true believers , as well as the fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom , Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud . Meanwhile , in Jakarta , an epidemic of the flu is underway . Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno , who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors . Mao sends doctors , who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government . The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint after he and his ministers have a large party with haraam events , including the consumption of pork and frog and zina ( sex outside of marriage ) . Muhammad and Gabriel , having transformed into eagles to observe Jakarta , see prostitution , adultery , theft , and drinking . Muhammad is shocked that zina and theft continue unabated , calling for Gabriel to help him stone the adulterers and cut the hands off the thieves . Gabriel replies that there are not enough stones for the adulterers , and the swords have been replaced by guns bought by the \" infidel \" Soviets and Americans who \" worship dollars \" . They later see a minister , referred to only as Togog , attempting to use the Gilchrist Document to overthrow Sukarno . Muhammad gives up on Indonesia , planning to install television in jannah . Eventually , Sukarno recovers from the poison and is told about the Gilchrist Document , also being told that the Chinese are reneging on their agreement to supply nuclear weapons for Indonesia 's confrontation with Malaysia . Sukarno uses the Gilchrist Document to spread rumours and distrust among the populace , demoting his commander of the military , while the Chinese ambassador is sent home . = = Writing and influences = = \" Langit Makin Mendung \" was written under the pen name Kipandjikusmin . HB Jassin , head editor of Sastra , said that Kipandjikusmin had been born to a Muslim family but educated in a Catholic junior school prior to being sent to a naval academy ; Jassin noted that this Catholic education , with literature which personifies God and angels , may have influenced his writing style . Another influence was Javanese wayang , or shadow puppets , with stories which traditionally have a hierarchy of anthropomorphic deities . Jassin also notes influences from the culture of the Guided Democracy era , evidenced from terms like sputnik and the social commentary , with strong condemnation of prostitution in Indonesia and Sukarno 's Nasakom . Kipandjikusmin later wrote to Ekspres magazine that his goal in writing the short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno 's government , focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so , yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed . He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin , writing that he had often thought of the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese Kahyangan , with God being similar to Batara Guru . His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of Christ as the Lamb of God . It was originally meant to be a serial , and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began . = = Style = = \" Langit Makin Mendung \" has been described as being written with crude and offensive expressions . Jassin argues that the style , though direct and at times discourteous , indicates a sense of irony , humor , sarcasm , and cynicism . = = Release and reception = = \" Langit Makin Mendung \" was published in the literary magazine Sastra , headed by HB Jassin , in August 1968 , under the pen name Kipandjikusmin . It became instantly controversial , with Indonesian Muslims considering it blasphemous and an insult to Islam . Among the points of contention were the anthropomorphic personification of Allah , as well as the \" less than respectful \" treatment of Muhammad and other Islamic figures . It was banned in North Sumatra on 12 October and groups of young Muslims attacked Sastra 's headquarters in Jakarta . After threats of prosecution , Jassin and his co-editor Rachman issued a public apology ; despite this , the magazine was banned . On 22 or 25 October 1968 , Kipandjikusmin followed suit , with a statement submitted to Kami . In April 1969 or February 1970 , the High Prosecutor 's office in Medan filed charges against Jassin , charging him with blasphemy after he was unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin 's true name . At trial , Jassin argued that , as the story was a product of the author 's imagination , it should not be considered an insult to Islam ; he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the Quran and Sufi literature , as well as the writer 's Christian influences . A witness for the prosecution , noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah ( Hamka ) , testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect , as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin , which were based on man 's love for Allah . Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades . Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence . = = Polemics = = = = = Literary = = = Jassin writes that \" Langit Makin Mendung \" , as a result of its author 's imagination , is not dogma , history , ethics , or an objective reality , but a work within its own world . As a result , Allah , Muhammad , and other religious figures are fictional characters and not representative of their counterparts . He further argues that \" Langit Makin Mendung \" is not written as an insult , but social criticism on perceived mistakes and corruption during the Sukarno period . He draws on parallels between \" Langit Makin Mendung \" , Dante 's Divine Comedy , and Allama Muhammad Iqbal 's Javid Nama , focusing on the journey of a person and a guide , with objections being raised due to readers identifying imagination with religion . Another critic , Bahrum Rangkuti , wrote that \" Langit Makin Mendung \" had to be judged based on Kipandjikusmin 's intentions , which he interpreted as ridding Islam of Nasakom , which he saw as not being compatible . He noted that the Muslims criticized in the story are those who act in ways that are not permitted in Islam , such as drinking and committing zina , while other targets include inept leadership and corruption . Like Jassin , Rangkuti notes numerous instances of Allah being personified in the Quran and hadiths ; he views the personification of Allah in \" Langit Makin Mendung \" as an attempt to draw Muslims closer to Allah . Sukarsono argues that \" Langit Makin Mendung \" would have been a \" monumental \" critique , with a good description of degeneration and immorality in the early 1960s , if written during Sukarno 's regime , like Machiavelli 's The Prince was for its time , but as it was released in the New Order it lost some of its impact . He notes that in most cases the personification of Allah as being compatible with Islamic views of Allah . However , Allah 's donning of gold spectacles is seen as being in contradiction to the tenets of Islam . An opposing view , offered by Indonesian literary critic M. Jusuf Lubis , is that \" Langit Makin Mendung \" , as it is based on actual events and dogma , including Muhammad 's night journey . He rejects the view that the controversy arose from a misunderstanding of the story , writing that Indonesian Muslims reacted because they will not accept works that they see as denying the existence of Allah or comparing Pancasila to Nasakom . He notes that Jassin is inconsistent in his defense , calling the representations of Allah , Muhammad , and Gabriel figments of the author 's imagination , but citing Sukarno and Nasakom as influences . = = = Legal = = = Many studies have been made pertaining to the legal aspects of the \" Langit Makin Mendung \" case . One opinion is that the prosecution office had no legal basis for acting as both judge and literary critic in the case , with the blasphemy laws used in prosecution not being at least government or parliamentary level . The banning of Sastra is criticized for having no legal basis , as laws pertaining to the banning of print media at the time only applied to foreign publications ; per the then-applicable Press Laws , any banning of a magazine would require approval of the Press Board . The need for freedom of speech is also mentioned . Another view is that the prosecution 's actions were justified , pointing to the obscurity of the press laws , as well as the intent to publish , indicated by the story 's prominent placement in the magazine . In response to arguments that the banning of Sastra was a violation of the right to freedom of speech , Sju 'bah Asa argues that the public and prosecutors have the same right , which can exercised through protests or legal action . Poet Taufiq Ismail notes that most protests against the prosecution 's actions were for their motion to ban Sastra , a reputable and respected publication , which does not indicate that \" Langit Makin Mendung \" was being supported .",

                    "text": "Battle of Staten Island = The Battle of Staten Island was a raid by Continental Army troops under Major General John Sullivan against British forces on Staten Island on August 22 , 1777 , during the American Revolutionary War . After British Lieutenant General William Howe sailed with most of his army from New York in July , the Americans recognized that the British position on Staten Island was vulnerable , and planned an attack . Sullivan 's raid was well-executed , but it suffered from a shortage of boats to effect the crossing , and one of its detachments was misled by its guide to the front of the enemy position rather than its rear . As a result , Sullivan did not take as many prisoners as expected , and had about 200 of his own men taken prisoner due in part to the lack of boats . Although Sullivan was accused of mismanaging the raid , a court martial held later in 1777 exonerated Sullivan of all charges . = = Background = = In March 1776 the British forces of General William Howe withdrew from Boston after Major General George Washington fortified high ground threatening the city and its harbor . With this army augmented by reinforcements from Europe , General Howe captured New York City , forcing Washington to retreat all the way across New Jersey . At the end of 1776 , Washington crossed the Delaware River and surprised German troops at Trenton , New Jersey , and eventually regained control of most of the state . The two armies then settled into winter quarters , although there was much skirmishing before the 1777 campaign got underway . On July 23 , 1777 , following months of preparation and some preliminary maneuvers in New Jersey , General Howe and his brother , Admiral Richard Howe , launched a fleet carrying most of the New York-based army south pursuant to their plan to capture the American capital , Philadelphia , by landing the army at the upper end of Chesapeake Bay and marching north . General Washington , although he was notified promptly of the fleet 's departure , was unaware of its destination . He heard on August 10 that the fleet appeared to be moving south of Philadelphia , possibly heading for Charleston , South Carolina . As a result , he prepared to move north to assist General Horatio Gates defend the Hudson River against Lieutenant General John Burgoyne 's march south from Quebec . On August 21 he was alerted that the fleet had been spotted one week earlier at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay . Realizing the danger to Philadelphia , he immediately issued orders to move the entire army south with all speed . His orders to Major General John Sullivan , who commanded the front line defenses in eastern New Jersey , were to rejoin the main army \" with all convenient speed \" . = = Prelude = = Sullivan , in the meantime , had learned that the departure of Howe 's army had left Staten Island vulnerable , and planned and put into execution a raid against British targets there . He had learned that although the bulk of British regulars were near the northern end of the island , about 700 New Jersey Loyalist militia were scattered along the western shore , facing the New Jersey mainland . His plan was to cross two groups onto the island from points in Elizabethtown ( present-day Elizabeth , New Jersey ) , capture prisoners from the isolated militia outposts , and destroy supplies . They would then go to the Old Blazing Star Ferry ( between present-day Carteret , New Jersey and Rossville , Staten Island ) to return to the mainland . British defenses on the island , under the overall command of Brigadier General John Campbell , consisted of the regular army elements from the 52nd Foot , regiments of so-called \" Hessians \" from the German states of Waldeck and Ansbach , and the Loyalist New Jersey militia known as Skinner 's Brigade under the command of Cortlandt Skinner . Campbell 's men ( including the German troops ) numbered about 900 , and were stationed near the northeastern tip of the island . Skinner 's men , numbering about 400 according to Campbell 's report , were stationed at outposts along the western shore between Dexter 's Ferry and Ward 's Point . General Sullivan , at his base in Hanover , New Jersey , ordered his commanders on August 20 to prepare their troops for a march the next day . Sources do not describe the precise composition of the troops chosen , but most of them were drawn from Sullivan 's division , which consisted of the First and Second Maryland Brigades . These brigades comprised the regiments of the Maryland Line ; additional troops chosen for the operation included companies from the 2nd Canadian Regiment and a company of New Jersey militia . On the afternoon of August 21 two columns numbering about 1,000 in all left the camp . One column was led by Brigadier General William Smallwood , and the other , headed by Sullivan , consisted of troops led by a French officer who had been given a Continental Army brigadier 's commission , the Chevalier Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre . After reaching Elizabethtown late that evening , they rested for a few hours , and began crossing early the next morning . One detachment , led by Colonel Matthias Ogden , crossed opposite Fresh Kills and rowed partway up the kill , in order to approach their target , the militia brigade of Elisha Lawrence , from its rear . The remaining troops crossed near Palmer 's run on the north side of the island , where they split into three groups . Smallwood and Sullivan led most of their columns away to attack specific targets , each leaving a regiment behind to cover their line of retreat . = = Battle = = Ogden attacked Lawrence 's outpost at dawn , surprising and routing the militia company . After a few minutes of battle he had taken 80 prisoners , and he moved on to the outpost of Lieutenant Colonel Edward Vaughan Dongan , commanding the 3rd battalion of Skinner 's Brigade . Dongan 's men put up stiff resistance , even though he was felled with a mortal wound . This prompted Ogden to retreat toward the Old Blazing Star . After waiting there as long as he thought prudent , Ogden crossed his men back to the mainland before Sullivan and Smallwood arrived . Sullivan moved to attack Skinner 's 5th battalion , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Barton , at the New Blazing Star Ferry , but these troops were alert , and fled when Sullivan 's forces advanced on them . Although Sullivan had placed troops to intercept men who tried to get away , many of Barton 's men escaped , crossing over to the Jersey shore or hiding in the woods and swamps of the area . Sullivan took 40 prisoners , including Barton . Some of his men advanced on Skinner 's headquarters , but the force there was too strong , and the Americans retreated . General Smallwood 's column was led by its guide to the front of the Loyalist battalion of Abraham van Buskirk , instead of its rear . He ordered the attack anyway , and Buskirk 's men fled until they were rallied by General Skinner , and the tables were then turned on the Americans . They beat a hasty retreat , although they had time to destroy camp supplies and equipment , and managed to seize a battle standard . Smallwood and Sullivan joined forces near Richmond , a village in the center of the island , and made their way to the Old Blazing Star . Sullivan sent for the boats to speed the crossing , but they never arrived , so he began crossing the troops and prisoners using the three boats that Ogden had commandeered to cross earlier . As they did this , Skinner and his company approached , accompanied by the forces of Campbell , the 52nd , and the Waldeck and Anspach regiments . Sullivan ordered the companies of Majors Stewart and Tillard to cover the retreat . Numbering roughly 80 men , they successfully held off the accumulated British forces until all other American troops had crossed to the mainland , repulsing several determined attempts to break through their line . Although some of this covering line managed to escape , a number of men were killed , and a sizable number surrendered after they ran out of ammunition and the British began firing grape shot at them . The British loss was given by the Loyalist publication Gaine 's Mercury of September 1 , 1777 as 5 killed , 7 wounded and 84 missing . Sir Henry Clinton wrote that the British took 259 prisoners in the engagement , whereas historian Douglas Southall Freeman gives the number of men captured as 150 . Twenty-one of the American prisoners were officers , one of whom was wounded ; the ranking officer captured was Lieutenant Colonel Edward Antill . = = Aftermath = = Sullivan 's forces marched south after the battle , and were able to join Washington 's defensive arrangements south of Philadelphia in time to participate in the key Battle of Brandywine on September 11 . General Sullivan was later subjected to a court martial over accusations that he mismanaged the expedition in a variety of ways . The court exonerated him of all charges .",

                    "text": "Second Battle of Kehl ( 1796 ) = The Second Battle of Kehl occurred on 18 September 1796 , when General Franz Petrasch 's Austrian and Imperial troops stormed the French-held bridgehead over the Rhine river . The village of Kehl , which is now in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg , was then part of Baden-Durlach . Across the river , Strasbourg , an Alsatian city , was a French Revolutionary stronghold . This battle was part of the Rhine Campaign of 1796 , in the French Revolutionary War of the First Coalition . In the 1790s , the Rhine was wild , unpredictable , and difficult to cross . Its channels and tributaries created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during the dry seasons . A complex of bridges , gates , fortifications and barrage dams linked Kehl with Strasbourg . These had been constructed by the fortress architect S\u00e9bastien le Pr\u00e9stre de Vauban in the seventeenth century . The crossings had been contested before : in 1678 during the French-Dutch war , in 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession , in 1733 during the War of the Polish Succession , and earlier in Battle of Kehl , when the French crossed into the German states on 23 \u2013 24 June . Critical to French success would be the army 's ability to cross the Rhine at will . The crossings at H\u00fcningen , near the Swiss city of Basel , and at Kehl , offered access to most of southwestern Germany ; from there , French armies could sweep north , south , or east , depending on their military goal . In late summer of 1796 , the Austrian force reacquired most of the territory lost to the French earlier in the summer . On 18 September 1796 , the Austrians temporarily acquired control of the t\u00eate-du-ponts ( bridgeheads ) joining Kehl and Strasbourg until a strong French counter-attack forced them to retreat , leaving the French in control of the bridges but the Austrians in control of the territory surrounding them . The situation remained in status quo until late October . Control of the surrounding territory there prevented the French from crossing to safety in Strasbourg , and required the French commander , Jean Victor Marie Moreau , to withdraw toward Basel . Immediately after the Battle of Schliengen ( 24 October 1796 ) , while most of Moreau 's army retreated south to cross the Rhine at H\u00fcningen , Count Baillet Latour moved his Austrian force to Kehl to begin a 100-day siege . = = Background : general campaign of 1796 = = The campaign of 1796 was part of the larger , broader French Revolutionary Wars in which republican France pitted itself against a fluid coalition of Prussians and Austrians and several other states of the Holy Roman Empire , the British , Sardinians , Dutch , and royalist French emigres . Although initially the republican French experienced several victories , the campaigns of 1793 through 1795 had been less successful . However , the Coalition partners had difficulty coordinating their war aims , and their own efforts also faltered . In 1794 and 1795 , French victories in northern Italy salvaged French enthusiasm for the war , and forced the Coalition to withdraw further into Central Europe . At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795 , the Habsburg Austrian Coalition and the French Republican called a truce between their forces that had been fighting in Germany . This agreement lasted until 20 May 1796 , when the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May . The Austrian Coalition 's Army of the Lower Rhine included 90,000 troops . The 20,000-man right wing , first under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W\u00fcrttemberg , then Wilhelm von Wartensleben , stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River , observing the French bridgehead at D\u00fcsseldorf . The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress included 10,000 more . The remainder of the Imperial and Coalition army , the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine , secured the west bank behind the Nahe River . Commanded by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser , this force anchored its right wing in Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Szt\u00e1ray , Michael von Fr\u00f6hlich and Louis Joseph , Prince of Cond\u00e9 guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland . The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on the west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn . After news arrived in Vienna of Napoleon Bonaparte 's successes , however , Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements , and the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground . On the French side , the 80,000-man Army of Sambre-et-Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to Sankt Wendel . On the army 's left flank , Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber had 22,000 troops in an entrenched camp at D\u00fcsseldorf . The right wing of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle was positioned behind the Rhine from H\u00fcningen northward , centered along the Queich River near Landau , and its left wing extended west toward Saarbr\u00fccken . Pierre Marie Barth\u00e9lemy Ferino led Moreau 's right wing at H\u00fcningen , Louis Desaix commanded the center and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the left wing . Ferino 's wing consisted of three infantry and cavalry divisions under Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Louis Bourcier and Henri Fran\u00e7ois Delaborde . Desaix 's command included three divisions led by Michel de Beaupuy , Antoine Guillaume Delmas and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles . Saint-Cyr 's wing had two divisions commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme and Alexandre Camille Taponier . The French plan called for a springtime ( April-May-June ) offensive during which the two armies would press against the flanks of the northern Coalition armies in the German states while a third army approached Vienna through Italy . Specifically , Jean-Baptiste Jourdan 's army would push south from D\u00fcsseldorf , hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves , while Moreau 's army massed on the east side of the Rhine by Mannheim . According to plan , Jourdan 's army feinted toward Mannheim , and Charles repositioned his troops . Once this occurred , Moreau 's army endured a forced march south and attacked the bridgehead at Kehl , which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops \u2014 troops recruited that spring from the Swabian Circle polities , inexperienced and untrained \u2014 which held the bridgehead for several hours , but then retreated toward Rastatt . Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard , and his troops poured into Baden unhindered . In the south , by Basel , Ferino 's column moved quickly across the river and advanced up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline toward Lake Constance , spreading into the southern end of the Black Forest . Worried that his supply lines would be overextended or his army would be flanked , Charles began a retreat to the east . At this point , in July , the jealousies and competition between the French generals came into play . Moreau could have joined up with Jourdan 's army in the north , but did not ; he proceeded eastward , pushing Charles into Bavaria , while Jourdan pushed eastward , pushing Wartensleben 's autonomous corps into the Ernestine duchies . On either side , the union of two armies \u2014 Wartensleben 's with Charles ' or Jourdan 's with Moreau 's \u2014 could have crushed their opposition . In August , Wartensleben 's autonomous corps united with Charles ' imperial troops and turned the tide against the French . The defeat of Jourdan 's army at the battles of Amberg ( 24 August ) , W\u00fcrzburg ( 3 September ) and 2nd Altenkirchen ( 16 \u2013 19 September ) allowed Charles to move more troops to the south , and effectively removed Jourdan from the remainder of the campaign . = = = Preliminary action at Bruchsal : September 1796 = = = While Charles and Moreau jockeyed for position on the eastern slope of the Black Forest , Franz Petrasch engaged the French at Bruchsal . The troops there , commanded by Marc Amand \u00c9lis\u00e9e Scherb , included the 68th Demi-brigade and two squadrons of the 19th Dragoons ; they had remained behind after the Battle of Ettlingen to observe the garrisons of Mannheim and Philippsburg . Realizing that his command was too small to withstand a concerted attack by the stronger Austrians , Scherb withdrew toward Kehl to secure the Rhine crossing to Strasburg , since Moreau , now well into a retreat across the mountains , would need the crossing for a safe passage to France . An initial Austrian attack on the French position at Bruchsal favored the French , who charged the Austrians with bayonets . Again , on 5 and 6 September , the Austrians spent most of the day skirmishing with the French at their advanced posts , masking their intention of circling around Bruchsal and marching south to secure the crossing to Strasbourg . General Scherb received intelligence of a contingent of infantry and cavalry marching against him and retired south . Scherb found the Austrians already in possession of Untergrombach , a village south of Bruchsal . After he tried to force his way through , the Austrians fell back to Weingarten at 49 \u00b0 3 \u2032 5 \u2033 N 8 \u00b0 31 \u2032 50 \u2033 E. Scherb found himself caught between detachments of Austrians by the Kinzig river and behind him . General Moreau deployed a demi-brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry from his army in the Black Forest , with instructions to proceed by forced marches to Kehl , but General Petrasch , acting on his own intelligence , sent Konstantin d 'Aspr\u00e9 with two battalions to occupy Renchen , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Kehl . This effectively prevented Moreau 's reinforcements from reaching Kehl and locked Scherb in place . The undermanned garrison at Kehl was on its own . = = = Kehl garrison status 16 \u2013 17 September = = = The Kehl garrison consisted of one battalion of the 24th Demi-brigade and some detachments of the 104th under command of Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg . This was too weak a force to defend a position of such importance , or to develop additional extensive works . Moreau reported that some of Scherb 's troops had arrived , but it is unclear which ones . Furthermore , the lack of cooperation from local peasant workers and the exhaustion of troops prevented the enhancements of the fortifications from proceeding with any speed . On the evening of 16 September , Petrasch and most of his column had arrived at Bischofsheim , immediately by Kehl , with three battalions and two squadrons ; more troops were not far behind . By 17 September , a small corps of Austrians approached the outskirts of Kehl and vigorously attacked the French sentries there ; this was merely a prelude to the more significant action the following day . = = Action of 18 September = = Before the break of dawn on 18 September ( 03 : 45 ) , three Austrian columns attacked Kehl , while another kept Scherb pinned down by the Kinzig . The Austrian principal column , comprising the 38th Regiment , crossed the Kinzig river above the French position and proceeded toward the dykes of the Rhine above ( south of ) Kehl . This placed them between Scherb 's force and Kehl . Using the dykes as protection , and conducted by some peasants familiar with the fortifications , they advanced as far as the horn work on the Upper Rhine and entered a gorge which led them to the outskirts of Kehl . The second column of the 38th Regiment , under command of Major Busch , proceeded via the hamlet of Sundheim toward Kehl , and obtained possession of the village itself , although not the bridge leading to Strasbourg . The third column , which included three companies of Serbians and a division of Hussars , executed a feint on the left bank of the river . One column of reserve , under the command of Franz Pongratz , approached as far as the French earthworks on the banks of the Rhine to support the columns ahead of him ; another , which included a battalion of the 12th Regiment ( Manfredini ) , moved past the hamlet by Neumuhl at 48 \u00b0 34 \u2032 12 \u2033 N 7 \u00b0 50 \u2032 38 \u2033 E toward Kehl . Quickly , the Austrians acquired control of all the earthworks of the town , the village itself , and the fortress ; their skirmishers reached one side of the abutment of an old bridge of palisades , and advanced to the other side , across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine . There , almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels , they halted ; there is some confusion about why they stopped . Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself , as Moreau seemed to think . Regardless , the troops there did not burn the bridge , but started plundering and drinking . The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge , but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them . The French executed several attempts to retake the bridges . The 68th , under command of general Jean-Baptiste de Sisce , was repulsed three times by the superior numbers of Austrians and the fearsome fire of case shot from four cannons that lined the principal road . Not until 19 : 00 did fortune favor the French , when Colonel d 'Aspr\u00e9 and two hundred men of the Regiment Ferdinand were captured within the fort itself . The next in command , a Major Delas , was badly wounded , leaving no one in overall command of the 38th Regiment . The French general Schauenburg , who had gone to Strasbourg for troops , returned with some reinforcements , including part of the Strasbourg national guard , and led these troops over the pontoon bridges . They met at once an impetuous Austrian attack , but were sufficiently strong to recover . At 22 : 00 , the Austrians still held the redoubt and the houses at the edge of the village ; the arrival of a fresh battalion of the 12th Regiment led to a new attack , but it was repulsed . Ultimately , though , the Austrians had insufficient reserves to meet the fresh troops from Strasbourg . By 23 : 00 , the French had recovered all of the Strasbourg suburbs , the village of Kehl and all of the French earthen works . According to Digby Smith and his sources , the Austrians lost 2,000 men killed , missing and wounded , and the French : 1,200 missing and captured . German sources report , though , that the Austrians lost 1,500 men and 300 prisoners , and the French had 300 dead and 800 wounded . = = Impact of September action = = Despite the limited success of Petrasch 's action , the action had a broad impact on the movements of the main armies of Moreau and Archduke Charles , which still maneuvered to the east . Moreau 's army would debouch through the Black Forest mountains , which lay to the east . By controlling the eastern access to the Kehl / Strasbourg crossing , Petrasch forced Moreau to march south ; any retreat into France would have to occur via the bridges at H\u00fcningen , a longer march , not at Kehl and Strasbourg . The next contact between the main armies occurred on 19 October at Emmendingen in the Elz valley , which winds through the Black Forest . The section of the valley involved in the battle runs south-west through the mountains from Elzach , through Bleibach and Waldkirch . Just to the south-west of Waldkirch , the river emerges from the mountains and flows north-west towards the Rhine , with the Black Forest to its right . This section of the river passes through Emmendingen before it reaches Riegel . Riegel sits in a narrow gap between the Black Forest and an isolated outcropping of volcanic hills known as the Kaiserstuhl . The Austrian and French armies met again at Schliengen on 24 October . Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights , offering him a tactically superior position . Charles threw his army against both flanks ; the French left flank fought stubbornly , but gave way under the pressure of Cond\u00e9 's emigre corps ; the right flank withstood a day-long battering by Latour and Nauendorf , but eventually had to withdraw . The loss of access to the crossing at Kehl forced Moreau to withdraw south to H\u00fcningen . With a strong rear guard provided by Generals Abbatucci and Lariboisi\u00e8re , he abandoned his position the same night and retreated part of the 9.7 miles ( 16 km ) to H\u00fcningen . The right and left wings followed . By 3 November , he had reached Haltingen , where he organized his force to cross over the bridges into France . The Archduke then sent most of his army north to besiege Kehl . = = Orders of battle = = The following troops participated in the action at Kehl . = = = French = = = 24th Demi-brigade de Ligne ( one battalion ) 68th Demi-brigade de Ligne ( three battalions ) 104th Demi-brigade de Ligne ( remnants ) 19th Dragoon Regiment ( two squadrons ) = = = Austrian = = = Infantry Regiment Nr. 12 ( three battalions ) Infantry Regiment Nr. 15 ( three battalions ) Infantry Regiment Nr. 38 ( elements )",

                    "text": "Battle of Ettlingen = The Battle of Ettlingen or Battle of Malsch ( 9 July 1796 ) was fought during the French Revolutionary Wars between the armies of the First French Republic and Habsburg Austria near the town of Malsch , 9 kilometres ( 6 mi ) southwest of Ettlingen . The Austrians under Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen tried to halt the northward advance of Jean Victor Marie Moreau 's French Army of Rhin-et-Moselle along the east bank of the Rhine River . After a tough fight , the Austrian commander found that his left flank was turned . He conceded victory to the French and retreated east toward Stuttgart . Ettlingen is located 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) south of Karlsruhe . The Rhine Campaign of 1796 saw Moreau 's army facing the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine under Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour in the south . Meanwhile , Jean-Baptiste Jourdan 's French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse opposed the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles in the north . Jourdan drubbed Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W\u00fcrttemberg at Altenkirchen on 4 June , compelling Archduke Charles to rush to the rescue with reinforcements . Charles defeated Jourdan at Wetzlar on the 15th , forcing him to pull back to the west bank of the Rhine . At this time there was a shake up in the high command and the archduke was put in control of both Austrian armies . In Charles ' absence , Moreau successfully crossed the Rhine at Kehl on the night of 23 \u2013 24 June and beat Latour at Rastatt on 5 July . Leaving Wilhelm von Wartensleben in charge in the north , Charles rushed south to confront Moreau along the Alb River near Ettlingen . After an all-day combat , the Austrians held the advantage on their right wing near Malsch , but the French had defeated their left wing in the Black Forest . = = Background = = = = = Plans = = = At the beginning of the Rhine Campaign of 1796 , Austria had two armies in Germany , the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen . The left wing of the 80,000-man Army of the Upper Rhine guarded the Rhine River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Szt\u00e1ray , Michael von Fr\u00f6hlich and Louis Joseph , Prince of Cond\u00e9 while its right wing was on the west bank around Kaiserslautern . The Army of the Lower Rhine had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W\u00fcrttemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at D\u00fcsseldorf . The archduke 's remaining 70,000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress . The Army of Rhin-et-Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was deployed with its right flank at Huningue , its center on the Queich River and its left flank at Saarbr\u00fccken . The Army of Sambre-et-Meuse commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was responsible for a line running north from Sankt Wendel to Cologne , while the 22,000 men of its left wing under Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber held D\u00fcsseldorf . The French grand strategy designed by Minister of War Lazare Carnot was for each of their two armies to turn the Austrian flanks . The strategic plan called for Jourdan to start by advancing by his left wing and was designed to accomplish two goals . First , it was hoped that this would cause the Austrians to abandon the west bank of the Rhine . Second , the move would draw Austrian strength north and allow Moreau 's army a better chance to cross the Rhine in the south . Until this time , the Army of Rhine-et-Moselle consisted of independent divisions . When Moreau assumed command he reorganized the army into three corps or wings plus a small reserve . Over the objections of all three men , he named Louis Desaix , Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr and Pierre Marie Barth\u00e9lemy Ferino wing commanders . The system soon proved its worth . Moreau 's other innovation was to group many of the heavy cavalry regiments in the army reserve . The Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval , Dragoon and Hussar regiments remained attached to the infantry divisions . On 8 June , Ferino 's Right Wing had three divisions led by Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Louis Bourcier ( 9,281 infantry , 690 cavalry ) , Henri Fran\u00e7ois Delaborde ( 8,300 infantry , 174 cavalry ) and Augustin Tuncq ( 7,437 infantry , 432 cavalry ) . Desaix 's Center had three divisions commanded by Michel de Beaupuy ( 14,565 infantry , 1,266 cavalry ) , Antoine Guillaume Delmas ( 7,898 infantry , 865 cavalry ) and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles ( 4,828 infantry , 962 cavalry ) . Saint-Cyr 's Left Wing had two divisions under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme ( 7,438 infantry , 895 cavalry ) and Alexandre Camille Taponier ( 11,823 infantry , 1,231 cavalry ) . Altogether , Moreau 's Army of Rhin-et-Moselle numbered 71,581 foot soldiers and 6,515 cavalry , plus gunners and sappers . Counting artillery and other elements , Moreau 's total was 79,592 soldiers while Jourdan commanded 77,792 men . = = = Operations = = = The Rhine Campaign of 1795 had concluded with an armistice . On 20 May 1796 , the Austrians notified the French that the truce would end on 1 June . The minute it expired , Kl\u00e9ber led two divisions across the armistice line heading south toward Charles ' right wing . The French beat the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen on 4 June , capturing 3,000 Austrians , four colors and 12 guns . By 6 June Kl\u00e9ber 's wing was on the Lahn River and Archduke Charles began evacuating the west bank of the Rhine in order to concentrate against the French incursion . Kl\u00e9ber was joined within a few days by Jourdan and most of the Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse . At about this time , the Austrian high command began transferring Wurmser and 25,000 Austrians to Italy due to the successes of Napoleon Bonaparte . On 15 June , the archduke defeated the French in the Battle of Wetzlar . Subsequently , Jourdan recrossed to the west bank of the Rhine while Kl\u00e9ber retreated north toward D\u00fcsseldorf . With Wurmser leaving the theater , Archduke Charles was given command over both Austrian armies . Wilhelm von Wartensleben took command of the Army of the Lower Rhine while Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour assumed leadership of the Army of the Upper Rhine . Jourdan and Kl\u00e9ber 's advance had caused their opponents to abandon the west bank of the Rhine and had drawn Charles north , as planned . Meanwhile , Moreau mounted operations against the Austrian fortifications opposite Mannheim in order to lead his enemies into thinking that it was the main attack . But on 24 June 1796 , Moreau launched a successful river crossing in the Battle of Kehl . The 7,000 defending troops of the Swabian Regional Contingent put up a stout fight but were defeated with the loss of 700 soldiers , 14 guns and 22 munition wagons . The French reported losses of 150 . Subsequently , Szt\u00e1ray took command of the Swabians who were reinforced up to a strength of 9,000 by some Austrians . On the 28th Szt\u00e1ray was beaten by Desaix at Renchen . The French sustained 200 casualties while allied losses amounted to 550 killed and wounded plus 850 men , seven guns and two munition wagons captured . Having blocked Jourdan , Archduke Charles began moving troops south to oppose the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle as early as 21 June . He received the news that Moreau was across the Rhine on the 26th . Leaving 25,351 foot and 10,933 horse under Wartensleben and 27,000 more around Mainz , the archduke raced south . The last units of the Moreau 's army made it across the Rhine on 29 June , though Delaborde remained guarding the west bank of the Rhine for a time . For a few days the French enjoyed a numerical superiority of 30,000 to 18,000 over their opponents . Moreau then made the remarkable decision to switch the positions of two of his wings ; Desaix now led the Left Wing while Saint-Cyr commanded the Center . He also reorganized his army , reassigning some regiments that got lost in the confusion of the river crossing . Army of Rhin-et-Moselle expanded its bridgehead in a semicircle . Desaix moved downstream ( north ) , Ferino moved upstream ( south ) and Saint-Cyr operated in the hills , ready to support either wing . The French irruption caused Fr\u00f6hlich and Cond\u00e9 to retreat up the Rhine and Kinzig Rivers while Szt\u00e1ray and the Swabians fell back to Freudenstadt . Moreau had an opportunity to smash one of the enemy forces , but he moved slowly . Saint-Cyr started from Oberkirch on 2 July . The next day his wing moved in an easterly direction , seizing enemy positions at Oppenau , on the Kniebis Mountain and at Freudenstadt . This deep thrust completely separated Fr\u00f6hlich from the rest of the Army of the Upper Rhine . Latour and Szt\u00e1ray tried to hold a position behind the Murg River but Desaix attacked them in the Battle of Rastatt on 5 July . To assist in this operation , Moreau directed Saint-Cyr to move down the Murg valley . On the same day as Rastatt , Taponier 's division captured Gernsbach . At Rastatt , the French employed 19,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to spar with 6,000 Austrians led by Karl Aloys zu F\u00fcrstenberg and Johann M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros von Szoboszl\u00f3 . The French turned both Austrian flanks , forcing their enemies to pull back east toward Ettlingen . Casualties on both sides were light . The Austrians lost 200 men and three guns captured . At Ettlingen Latour found the archduke 's leading elements , with the main body still a few days distant . The Austrians were in a vulnerable situation but Moreau delayed for three days at Rastatt , allowing Charles to bring up 25 battalions and 39 squadrons . = = Battle = = = = = French army = = = On 1 July 1796 , Ferino 's Right Wing was organized into one division under Delaborde and four brigades led by Nicolas Louis Jordy , Nicolas Augustin Paillard , Jean Victor Tharreau and Jean-Baptiste Tholm\u00e9 . Jordy led the 3rd and 38th Line Infantry Demi Brigades . Tharreau directed the 3rd Light and the 56th , 74th , 79th and 89th Line Infantry Demi Brigades . Paillard commanded the 12th and 21st ( heavy ) Cavalry Regiments while Tholm\u00e9 commanded the 18th Cavalry , 4th Dragoon and 8th Hussar Regiments . Tuncq was not listed as leading a division . Ferino 's wing counted 18,622 foot soldiers and 1,039 horsemen . At the same date , Desaix 's Left Wing was made up of the divisions of Beaupuy and Delmas . In Beaupuy 's division , Dominique Joba led the 10th , 62nd and 103rd Line and the 10th Light Demi Brigades while Gilles Joseph Martin Brunteau Saint-Suzanne commanded the 4th and 8th Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval and the 6th Dragoons . In Delmas ' division Jean Marie Rodolph Eickemeyer directed the 50th and 97th Line and 16th Light Infantry Demi Brigades while Maurice Frimont led the 7th Hussar and 10th and 17th Dragoon Regiments . Xaintrailles was not named as a division commander . Desaix 's command comprised 17,126 bayonets and 2,058 sabers . A report from 9 July 1796 showed that Saint-Cyr 's Center had two divisions under Duhesme and Taponier . In Duhesme 's division , Dominique Vandamme 's brigade included the 17th Line ( 2,793 ) and 100th Line ( 2,479 ) , 20th Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval ( 254 ) and 11th Hussars ( 38 ) . Duhesme 's division counted 5,272 infantry and 292 cavalry . Taponier 's division consisted of the brigades of Henri Fran\u00e7ois Lambert , Antoine Laroche Dubouscat and Claude Lecourbe . Lambert led the 93rd Line ( 3,119 ) and 109th Line ( 2,769 ) . Laroche directed the 21st Light ( 2,284 ) and 31st Line ( 2,840 ) . Lecourbe commanded the 84th Line ( 2,692 ) , 106th Line ( 3,186 ) and 2nd Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval ( 240 ) . There were a total of 22,162 foot soldiers , 532 horsemen and 433 gunners in Saint-Cyr 's wing . However , a 14 June report showed 919 troopers present in Saint-Cyr 's command , including the 9th Hussars . On 1 July , Bourcier 's Reserve division comprised one brigade under Jean Marie Forest with the 93rd and 109th Line ( detached to Saint-Cyr by 9 July ) , the 1st and 2nd Carabiniers and the 3rd , 9th , 14th and 15th Cavalry Regiments . The cavalry counted 1,577 sabers . In Moreau 's army , all infantry demi brigades had three battalions , all Cavalry regiments had three squadrons , while Carabinier , Chasseur , Dragoon and Hussar Regiments had four squadrons . There were 8,201 infantry and 238 cavalry in garrison at Bitche , Kehl , Landau and Strasbourg . Marc Amand \u00c9lis\u00e9e Scherb with 2,812 foot and 239 horse watched the Austrian-held Philippsburg fortress . Moreau 's chief of staff was Jean Reynier and his chief of artillery was Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9 . Moreau had 36,000 men available in 45 battalions and 55 squadrons . = = = Austrian army = = = On 3 July , the Army of the Upper Rhine was organized into divisions under Fr\u00f6hlich , F\u00fcrstenberg , Szt\u00e1ray and Johann Sigismund Riesch . In addition , Archduke Charles personally commanded divisions under Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze and von Lindt . Fr\u00f6hlich had three brigades led by Cond\u00e9 , Johann Jacob von Klingling and Simon von Wolf . F\u00fcrstenberg led seven brigades under Zaiger , Milius , Joseph Heinrich von Staader , Ignaz Gyulai , Johann Baptist von Leloup , Franz Walter Anton von Canisius and Paul Devay . The last two brigades were detached to Latour 's direct command along with the divisions Szt\u00e1ray and Riesch . Szt\u00e1ray 's division included five brigades under Ludwig Wilhelm Anton Baillet de Latour-Merlemont , Konrad Valentin von Kaim , Prince Joseph de Lorraine-Vaudemont , Duke Alexander of W\u00fcrttemberg and Johann I Joseph , Prince of Liechtenstein . Riesch 's division had three brigades under Count Palatine , Adam Boros de R\u00e1kos and an unknown officer . In the archduke 's corps , Hotze commanded three Austrian brigades under Wilhelm Lothar Maria von Kerpen , Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg and Joseph von Schellenberg . Lindt led five Electoral Saxon brigades . The Austrian order of battle for 9 July showed the army organized into four columns . The 1st Column under Kaim included two brigades under Schellenberg and Christoph von Lattermann . Schellenberg had two battalions each from Grand Duke of Tuscany Nr. 23 and Olivier Wallis Nr. 29 Infantry Regiments , six companies from the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Slavonian Infantry Regiment and one squadron of the Archduke Ferdinand Hussar Regiment Nr. 32 . Lattermann led three battalions of the Archduke Charles Nr. 3 Infantry Regiment , the Abfaltern and Retz Grenadier Battalions and two squadrons each of the Szekler Hussar Regiment and Waldeck Dragoon Regiment Nr. 39 . Szt\u00e1ray commanded the 2nd Column which consisted of an Advanced Guard under Devay , two brigades led by Latour-Merlemont and the Prince of Lorraine and two unbrigaded mounted units , four squadrons each of the Archduke John Dragoons Nr. 26 and Waldeck Dragoons . Devay led two battalions of the Pellegrini Nr. 49 Infantry Regiment , one battalion each of the Splenyi Nr. 51 and Serbian Infantry Regiments , seven squadrons of the Archduke Ferdinand Hussars and six squadrons of the Kinsky Chevau-l\u00e9gers Nr. 7 . Latour-Merlemont commanded three battalions of the Manfredini Nr. 12 Infantry Regiment and the Candiani , Dietrich , Reisingen and Warren Grenadier Battalions . Lorraine directed four squadrons each of the Kavanaugh Nr. 12 and Archduke Franz Nr. 29 Cuirassiers . Latour led the 3rd Column which was organized into an Advanced Guard under Canisius and three brigades directed by Kerpen , Liechtenstein and W\u00fcrttemberg . Canisius commanded three battalions of the Franz Kinsky Nr. 47 Infantry Regiment , four companies from the Serbian and three companies of the Slavonian Infantry Regiments , six squadrons of the Lobkowitz Chevau-l\u00e9gers Nr. 28 , four squadrons of the Szekler Hussars and two squadrons of the Coburg Dragoons Nr. 37 . Kerpen led three battalions of the Alton Nr. 15 Infantry Regiment and the Bideskuty , Szenassy and Benjowski Grenadier Battalions . Liechtenstein controlled three squadrons of the Kaiser Dragoons Nr. 1 . W\u00fcrttemberg directed six squadrons of the Mack Nr. 20 and four squadrons of the Ansbach Nr. 33 Cuirassiers . The small 4th Column was commanded by Johann Nepomuk von Mosel and consisted of two battalions of the Schr\u00f6der Nr. 7 Infantry Regiment , one battalion of the Leloup J\u00e4gers and two squadrons each of the Albert Nr. 5 and Kaiser Nr. 15 Carabiniers . Lindt 's Saxon infantry was made up of the Brandenstein and Glaffay Grenadier Battalions , one battalion of Weimar J\u00e4gers , and one battalion each of the K\u00fcrfurst , Prinz Anton , Prinz Clemens , Prince Gotha and Van der Hayde Infantry Regiments . The Saxon mounted troops included four squadrons each of the Carabinier , Hussar and Prinz Albert and Courland Chevau-l\u00e9ger Regiments plus two squadrons of the Saxe-Gotha Cavalry Regiment . Altogether , Charles had about 32,000 troops available . = = = Combat = = = After conferring with Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen , Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796 . This decision preempted Archduke Charles , who had planned to attack the French on the 10th . The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in the Rhine plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest . For his part , Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach . Latour held the Austrian right near the Rhine , Szt\u00e1ray was posted in the center near Malsch , Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt 's Saxons held the far left near Neuenb\u00fcrg . Moreau accompanied Desaix 's Left Wing with the divisions of Delmas and Sainte-Suzanne ( vice Beaupuy ) , Bourcier 's Reserve and Saint-Cyr 's cavalry and horse artillery which were ineffective in the mountains . Malsch was captured twice by the French and recaptured each time by the Austrians . Latour tried to force his way around the French left with cavalry but was checked by the mounted troops of the Reserve . Finding his horsemen outnumbered near \u00d6tigheim , Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay . In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM . In the evening the Austrians were pushing Desaix back when bad news from the left flank caused Charles to call a halt . Kaim had six battalions of infantry , four squadrons of cavalry and plenty of artillery deployed at Rothenzholl . He posted three more battalions at Frauenalb to the north and an advance guard in Loffenau . Saint-Cyr left Duhesme 's division behind to guard Freudenstadt and the Kneibis Mountain . He started from Gernsbach with 12 battalions plus six more borrowed from the Reserve . Finding that the Saxons were marching south along the Enz River to turn his right flank , he sent Taponier with six battalions and 150 hussars east to Wildbad . Taponier surprised the Saxons and sent them scurrying back north . With Lambert and Lecourbe 's brigades , Saint-Cyr advanced through Loffenau to Rothenzholl northwest of Dobel where he confronted Kaim . Finding the Austrians in powerful defenses , Saint-Cyr tried to draw Kaim 's troops out of position . Employing elements of the 84th and 106th Line , the French wing commander ordered the troops not to press home their assault , but to retreat every time they came against strong resistance . Each attack was pushed farther up the ridge before receding into the valley . When the fifth assault in regimental strength gave way , the defenders finally reacted , sweeping down the slope to cut off the French . Saint-Cyr now sprung his trap . Lecourbe led the massed grenadier companies to attack one Austrian flank , other reserves bored in on the other flank and the center counterattacked . The French troops that struck the Austrian right were hidden in the nearby town of Herrenalb . As the Austrians gave way , the French followed them up the ridge right into their positions . Nevertheless , Kaim 's men laid down such a heavy fire that Lecourbe 's grenadiers were thrown into disorder and their leader nearly captured . At length , Saint-Cyr 's troops emerged triumphant , inflicting 1,000 casualties on their opponents and capturing two cannons . Kaim was compelled to withdraw east across the hills to Neuenb\u00fcrg . From there , Kaim and Lindt 's soldiers fell back toward Pforzheim . = = Results = = French losses numbered 2,000 killed and wounded plus 400 captured . The Austrians suffered 1,300 killed and wounded with 1,300 captured . On 10 July , Charles evacuated Malsch and ordered a forced march east to Pforzheim via Karlsruhe . Also on the 10th , the French occupied Ettlingen and Neuenb\u00fcrg . Anxious to protect his magazines at Heilbronn , Charles halted at Pforzheim for a few days . For his part , Moreau would not believe that Charles had given up , so he waited around Ettlingen for several days . Meanwhile , the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July . The next day , Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone . When Archduke Charles withdrew from the Rhine valley , he left about 30,000 troops in garrisons along the river . There were 15,000 foot and 1,200 horse in Mainz , 3,000 infantry in Ehrenbreitstein , 8,800 infantry and 300 cavalry in Mannheim and 2,500 foot soldiers in Philippsburg . To contain the first two , Jourdan left 28,545 troops under Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9verin Marceau-Desgraviers while Moreau only detailed 2,800 infantry and 240 cavalry to watch the last two places . For the most part , the Austrian garrisons remained quiescent . But the Austrians in Mannheim caused mischief by attacking Kehl on 18 September . More might have been accomplished in that assault , but the Austrian soldiers paused to pillage the French camp and were driven off by their enemies . Even so , Charles not only lost the services of the 30,000 men in the fortresses but also of the Swabians , Saxons and other German allies when he retreated from the Rhine . These auxiliary forces began to negotiate with the French when their territories were occupied . Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps believed that Charles might have remained along the Rhine and defeated the French armies one after the other . Unlike the divided command of the French , the Austrians enjoyed unity of command . After Ettlingen , Phipps thought that the correct French strategy was for the two French armies to join . However , this was not part of Carnot 's plan , which was for each army to operate against the Austrian flanks . Carnot 's strategy had succeeded in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign and he expected that it would win again . However , in 1794 the Coalition was made up of several countries with different vulnerabilities , while in 1796 Charles could issue a command and expect it to be obeyed . The next clash would be the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August . = = External sources = = These sources identify the Austrian regiment numbers . Pivka , Otto von ( 1979 ) .

                    "text": "Raid on Haverhill ( 1708 ) = The Raid on Haverhill was a military engagement that took place on August 29 , 1708 during Queen Anne 's War . French , Algonquin , and Abenaki warriors under the command of Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville descended on Haverhill , then a small frontier community in the Province of Massachusetts Bay . In the surprise attack , 16 people were killed and another 14 to 24 were taken captive . A rapid militia muster gave chase , and in a skirmish later in the day , nine of the French and Indian party were killed and some of their prisoners escaped . Haverhill was not the original target of the raiders . Expecting a larger Indian contingent , French authorities planned to engage in a series of raids on the communities of the Piscataqua River . However , the unwillingness of some Indian tribes to participate in the expedition forced the French to reduce the scope of the operation and choose an easier target . The raid was more costly to the French than previous frontier raids like that in 1704 on Deerfield , Massachusetts because the province had been warned of the raiders ' advance . = = Background = = When Queen Anne 's War ( as the War of the Spanish Succession was called in the colonies of British America ) broke out in 1702 , it sparked war on the already tense frontier between the English colonies of New England and the colonies of New France , including Acadia and Canada . French military officers from the troupes de la marine , the defense force of New France , often led parties of Indians from their settlements along the Saint Lawrence River south to the northern frontiers of New England , which then included small communities in what is now northern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire and Maine . The largest and most successful raid of the war occurred in February 1704 , when Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville led about 250 men , principally Indians on a raid against the frontier town of Deerfield in the Province of Massachusetts Bay . Hertel de Rouville 's band killed or took prisoner many of the townsfolk , returning to Canada on a difficult trek in which a number of the prisoners died ; many of the surviving captives were adopted into Indian communities afterward . Massachusetts fortified its frontier with militia in response to this raid , and launched a raid against Acadia in retaliation . The Massachusetts village of Haverhill was also subjected to smaller-scale raids in 1704 , but it was not originally the target of the ambitious expedition planned by New France 's Governor-General Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil in 1708 . In the aftermath of the failed English siege of Port Royal , Acadia in 1707 , Vaudreuil was criticized by French Marine Minister the Comte de Pontchartrain for failing to apply sufficient pressure on the New England colonies . Vaudreuil was also concerned over the increasing tendency of Indians that were under French influence to engage in illicit trade with the Province of New York , cutting into New France 's economic activity . Vaudreuil decided to address these issues by organizing a major raid into New England that was intended to be even larger in scope than the Deerfield raid . Vaudreuil 's plan was to amass a force of as many as 400 men for attacks on the towns of New Hampshire on the Piscataqua River . In order to maintain some secrecy over the size and target of the expedition , forces from several points along the Saint Lawrence River would descend to Lake Winnipesaukee , where they would rendezvous with Abenaki and Pennacook tribal parties . The main French party departed from Trois-Rivi\u00e8res , and consisted of about 100 men , drawn from Canadian militia and the troupes de la marine , under the command of Hertel de Rouville . This party included a number of veterans from the Deerfield raid , and they were accompanied by bands of Abenaki and Nipissing . A band of 220 Iroquois from the Kanehsatake and Kahnawake tribes was to depart Montreal under the command of Ren\u00e9 Boucher de La Perri\u00e8re , and additional Huron and Abenakis were to come from near Quebec . Reports that a major expedition was being planned made their way via Indian traders to Albany , New York , and from there to Boston . Because the expedition 's targets were not known , little could be done to prepare specific defenses . A party of about 40 provincial militia were sent to Haverhill in response to these reports . = = Expedition difficulties = = Elements of the expedition departed in mid-July from the Saint Lawrence River . As the Quebec party ascended the Saint-Fran\u00e7ois River , a Huron died in an accident . This was viewed as a bad portent by many of the Indians , and the Hurons turned back . Among the Iroquois from Montreal , who traveled via Lake Champlain , some men fell sick and the rest refused to continue , in what some contemporaries thought was a ruse by the Iroquois to avoid conflict . Vaudreuil believed this was the case , and reports reached the English at Albany that the Iroquois had deliberately chosen to abandon the expedition \" not to join war against New England . \" Despite these setbacks , Vaudreuil ordered Hertel de Rouville to press on , even if he received no further reinforcements . When his company reached Lake Winnipesaukee , he found that no eastern Indians willing to participate in the expedition had been found . Hertel de Rouville was consequently left with a band of about 160 men , which limited his options for raiding targets to places that were less fortified . Haverhill was chosen as the target for several reasons . The village layout was already well-known from the 1704 raids and from an earlier raid in the Nine Years ' War . It was not particularly large ( 25 to 30 houses ) , its location lent itself poorly to defense , and only some of the houses were fortified . A fast-moving raiding party could be in and out of the village before the alarm could be raised . The party arrived outside Haverhill and prepared to begin the raid on Sunday , August 29 . It was joined at some point on its travels by the exiled Abenaki war chief Escumbuit , who lived not far from Haverhill , and had received word of the expedition 's advance . At the time , responsibility for Haverhill 's defense was divided . The local militia was under the command of Simon Wainwright , whose house had a view of the entire village . The town 's defenses had been supplemented by three small ( three to four man ) garrisons of colonial troops under the overall command of Major Turner . = = Raid = = The raiders successfully sneaked past the outer garrisons of provincial militia , and were first spotted in the pre-dawn light by a villager . Firing his gun to raise the alarm , he ran for the village , with the French and Indians in noisy pursuit . The action quickly became general as the raiders descended on the houses in the village . One of the colonial garrisons was stationed in the home of the minister , Benjamin Rolfe , who had barred the door in an attempt to keep the raiders out . Raiders fired through the door , wounding Rolfe , and then broke the door down . They then slaughtered Rolfe , his wife , infant child , and the colonial militiamen , who , \" paralyzed by fear \" , were begging for mercy . In another house , one baby was thrown through an open window by a raider but suffered no injury . A number of villagers escaped by hiding in cellars whose trapdoors were not discovered by the raiders . Captain Wainwright was preparing to organize a defense when gunfire from the raiders passed through the door to his house , killing him instantly . The raiding and pillaging continued until the sounds of approaching militia companies reached the raiders , who quickly lit the town meetinghouse on fire and left with their accumulated prisoners and loot . The reinforcements came from neighboring communities ( some from as far away as Salem ) and mustered under Major Turner 's command when they arrived . One party of Haverhill militiamen discovered the raiders ' baggage camp several miles from the village , and took their packs . Captain Samuel Ayer 's company , numbering about 20 , pursued the retreating raiders . Eventually strengthened by further militia , he engaged the encumbered raiders . In a furious rear-guard action the raiders fought off the militia ( killing Ayer in the action ) , but lost nine killed , including Hertel de Rouville 's brother , and 18 wounded . Because of the skirmish , the raiders abandoned some of their loot , and some of their prisoners got away . The village recorded that 30 to 40 people were killed or captured , which included those who escaped in the later skirmish . = = Aftermath = = The raiders ' return to Canada was difficult . Joseph Bartlett , one of their captives , described the privations suffered due the loss of the force 's baggage . One day they caught a hawk , which was divided among 15 men ; his share , the head , was \" the largest meal I had these four days . \" Bartlett remained in captivity with the Indians for four years . Some of the Frenchmen , rather than attempt the journey without their supplies , surrendered themselves to Massachusetts authorities . French accounts of the raid greatly exaggerated the numbers involved , claiming that several hundred had been killed , and that the post-raid skirmish had involved as many as 200 English colonists . The raid was more costly to the French than previous raids had been : because of better preparedness on the part of the Massachusetts militia , the French suffered a higher proportion of casualties than they had in the Deerfield raid . The raid was the last large-scale attack the French launched against Massachusetts in the war . Minor attacks occurred along its frontier , and Wells , then part of Massachusetts but now in Maine , was attacked by a substantial force in 1712 . Port Royal fell in 1710 to an expedition that included British marines , and the British abandoned a 1711 naval expedition against Quebec after some of its troop transports ran aground at the mouth of the St. Lawrence with significant loss of life .",

                    "text": "Battle of the Rice Boats = The Battle of the Rice Boats , also called the Battle of Yamacraw Bluff , was a land and naval battle of the American Revolutionary War that took place in and around the Savannah River on the border between the Province of Georgia and the Province of South Carolina on March 2 and 3 , 1776 . The battle pitted the Patriot militia from Georgia and South Carolina against a small fleet of the Royal Navy . In December 1775 , the British Army was besieged in Boston . In need of provisions , a Royal Navy fleet was sent to Georgia to purchase rice and other supplies . The arrival of this fleet prompted the colonial rebels who controlled the Georgia government to arrest the British Royal Governor , James Wright , and to resist the British seizure and removal of supply ships anchored at Savannah . Some of the supply ships were burned to prevent their seizure , some were recaptured , but most were successfully taken by the British . Governor Wright escaped from his confinement and safely reached one of the fleet 's ships . His departure marked the end of British control over Georgia , although it was briefly restored when Savannah was retaken by the British in 1778 . Wright again ruled from 1779 to 1782 , when British troops were finally withdrawn during the closing days of the war . = = Background = = In April 1775 , tensions over British colonial policies in the Thirteen Colonies boiled over into war with the Battles of Lexington and Concord . Following those events , Patriot colonists surrounded the city of Boston , placing it under siege , although the encirclement was incomplete : the city could be resupplied by sea . News of this action and the June Battle of Bunker Hill fanned the flames of independence throughout the colonies . Although the Province of Georgia had managed to remain relatively neutral before these events , radicals in the Georgia provincial congress came into power during the summer of 1775 and progressively stripped Georgia 's Royal Governor , James Wright , of his powers . While Wright had requested a naval presence near Savannah , Patriots in Charleston , South Carolina had intercepted his request and substituted for it a dispatch indicating he did not need such support . The dispute in Georgia reached a crisis point when British men-of-war began arriving at Tybee Island in January 1776 . On January 12 , three ships were seen at anchor off Tybee Island ; by January 18 the fleet consisted of the HMS Cherokee , HMS Siren , HMS Raven , HMS Tamar , and a number of smaller vessels . Wright 's opinion , expressed to Joseph Clay and others , was that the fleet had been sent to punish the local rebels . In fact , these ships were the beginnings of a fleet assembled to acquire provisions in Savannah for the beleaguered British troops in Boston . In December 1775 General William Howe had ordered an expedition to purchase rice and other provisions in Georgia . By early February the entire fleet had assembled off Tybee Island . It was under the overall command of Captain Andrew Barclay ( or Barkley ) on the HMS Scarborough , and included HMS Hinchinbrook and two transports , HMS Whitby and HMS Symmetry , carrying about 200 British army regulars from the 40th Foot under the command of Major James Grant . The arrival of the first ships in January prompted the Georgia Committee of Safety to order the arrest of Wright and other provincial representatives of the Crown on January 18 . Joseph Habersham , a major in the Georgia militia , placed Governor Wright under house arrest , and extracted a promise from the governor that he would not attempt to communicate with the British ships . Wright , who continued to be harassed in spite of his confinement , feared for his life , and escaped the mansion on the night of February 11 . He made his way to the plantation of a Loyalist supporter and was taken from there to the Scarborough . In the meantime , Georgia 's provincial assembly had met , elected representatives to the Second Continental Congress , and begun the process of raising regiments for the Continental Army . After Governor Wright arrived aboard the Scarborough he wrote a letter to the remaining members of his council , in which he expressed frustration over getting assurances of safety and access to the desired supplies from the Patriot authorities . Georgia had , along with the other twelve colonies , in 1774 adopted the terms of the Continental Association created by the First Continental Congress banning trade with Great Britain . With negotiations effectively failed , Barclay ordered his fleet into action on February 29 . His objective was a number of merchant vessels docked at Savannah , whose owners were desirous of moving their goods , something that became possible on March 1 when the previous constraints expired . = = Battle = = On March 1 , Scarborough , Tamar , Cherokee , and Hinchinbrook sailed up the Savannah River to Five-Fathom Hole , accompanying transports carrying two to three hundred men under Grant 's command . Hinchinbrook and one of the transports then sailed up the Back River . The transport anchored opposite the port area , while Hinchinbrook , in an attempt to take a position above the town , grounded on a sandbank in the river . Gunfire from Joseph Habersham 's militia cleared Hinchinbrook 's decks , but without suitable boats , Habersham was unable to attempt the taking of the vessel , which floated free on the next high tide . Late on the evening of March 2 , Grant 's men were landed on Hutchinson Island . They made their way across the island , and , at 4 : 00 am on March 3 , took over a number of the rice boats anchored near the island . Due to their success at remaining quiet , and possibly with the collusion of the ship captains , the alarm was not raised in Savannah until 9 : 00 am . The arrival of the ships on March 1 prompted the Committee of Safety to issue calls for the defense of the town and the ships , which were forward along with a request for assistance to South Carolina 's Committee of Safety the next day . When the alarm was raised , Colonel McIntosh took 300 militiamen and set up three 4-pound cannons on Yamacraw Bluff . He then sent Lieutenant Daniel Roberts and Major Raymond Demer\u00e9 II under a parley flag to one of the occupied ships ; they were promptly arrested . When a second , larger , parley arrived to discuss the release of the two captives and the ships , the situation turned nasty when Captain Rogers , leader of the party , was insulted . After he fired at someone on the occupied ship , the British responded in kind , wounding one and very nearly sinking the parley group 's boat . Following that boat 's retreat , McIntosh opened fire with the cannons on the bluff , beginning a gunbattle that lasted for four hours . The Committee of Safety , when it met to discuss the situation , decided that the supply ships should be burned , and a company of militia was assembled to accomplish this task . One supply ship , the Inverness , was torched and set adrift toward the occupied vessels , causing a scramble as the British troops hurried to abandon them in the face of the arriving fire ship . During the confusion , the Patriot militia and battery were active , raking the scurrying British crews with musket fire and grape shot . Two of the occupied vessels managed to get away downstream , and two more escaped the flames by going upstream , but were forced to dock , and their crews were taken prisoner . Three ships succumbed to the flames , which burned well into the night . The action was assisted by the timely arrival of 500 South Carolina militia sent in response to the earlier appeal . = = Aftermath = = Colonel McIntosh sent a parley to Captain Barclay the next day , offering a prisoner exchange . When Barclay refused the exchange , the Committee of Safety ordered the arrest of the remaining members of Wright 's council . This move proved successful ; the British-held prisoners were released in exchange for promises of protection of those councillors . In spite of the action , the British successfully sailed most of the merchant ships down the Back River , although some of the ships needed to dump a portion of their cargo in order to make it down the shallow channel . Once they reached Tybee Island , the desired provisions , amounting to 1,600 barrels of rice , were loaded onto the two British transport ships . The fleet remained anchored off Tybee Island while negotiations went on over the exchange of prisoners . During this time the fleet detained several arriving vessels , which were later disposed of as prizes . On March 25 , a band of militia from Savannah burned all the houses on the island to deny their use to Wright and the ships ' officers . Barclay weighed anchor on March 30 and sailed north , leading the convoy of merchant ships and transports . As the British had abandoned Boston earlier in March , he first put into Newport , Rhode Island , where the local Patriots denied him any assistance and fired at his ships using field artillery . He eventually rejoined the British forces at Halifax , Nova Scotia in May . The battle and Wright 's departure marked the end of British control over Georgia until Savannah was recaptured by British forces in December 1778 . Governor Wright returned , and Savannah then remained in British hands until 1782 .",

                    "text": "Battle of Roat\u00e1n = The Battle of Roat\u00e1n ( sometimes spelled \" Rattan \" ) was an American War of Independence battle fought on March 16 , 1782 , between British and Spanish forces for control of Roat\u00e1n , an island off the Caribbean coast of present-day Honduras . A Spanish expeditionary force under Mat\u00edas de G\u00e1lvez , the Captain General of Spanish Guatemala , gained control of the British-held island after bombarding its main defences . The British garrison surrendered the next day . The Spanish evacuated the captured soldiers , 135 civilians and 300 slaves , and destroyed their settlement , which they claimed had been used as a base for piracy and privateering . The assault was part of a larger plan by G\u00e1lvez to eliminate British influence in Central America . Although he met with temporary successes , the British were able to maintain a colonial presence in the area . = = Background = = Following the entry of Spain into the American War of Independence in 1779 , both Spain and Great Britain contested territories in Central America . Although most of the territory was part of the Spanish Captaincy General of Guatemala , the British had established logging rights on the southern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula ( present-day Belize ) , and had established informal settlements ( lacking formal colonial authority ) on the Mosquito Coast of present-day Honduras and Nicaragua . Guatemalan Governor Mat\u00edas de G\u00e1lvez had moved quickly when the declaration of war arrived , seizing St. George 's Caye , one of the principal British island settlements off the Yucatan coast . Many of the British fled that occupation to the island of Roat\u00e1n , another British-controlled island about 40 miles ( 64 km ) off the Honduran coast . British commander Edward Marcus Despard used Roat\u00e1n as a base for guerilla-style operations to extend and maintain British influence on the Mosquito Coast , and for privateering operations against Spanish shipping . ( Sources do not indicate whether Despard was present on Roat\u00e1n at the time of the Spanish attack ; if he was , he was probably not captured , since he continued to be active in the area . Stephens suggests that he was on Jamaica at the time . ) G\u00e1lvez , who had been ordered by King Charles to \" dislocate the English from their hidden settlements on the Gulf of Honduras \" , began planning offensive operations against the British mainland settlements as early as 1780 , after the British abandoned their failed expedition into Nicaragua . He raised as many as 15,000 militia , and received financial and logistical support from many parts of the Spanish colonial empire in the Americas . For logistical and diplomatic reasons , no operations were launched until after the American victory at Yorktown in October 1781 . The British loss opened the possibility that the British would be able to deploy troops to Central America to better defend the area . G\u00e1lvez ' plans called for assaults on the British presence in the Bay Islands ( principally Roat\u00e1n ) , followed by a sweep along the coast to eliminate the British from the mainland . Troops from central Guatemala were staged in early 1782 at Trujillo for the assault on Roat\u00e1n , while additional forces moved overland from Nicaragua , Honduras , and Salvador toward the principal British settlement of Black River . G\u00e1lvez arrived at Trujillo on March 8 to organise the assault on Roat\u00e1n . Leaving a force of 600 at Trujillo to further harass the British and their partisan allies , he embarked another 600 troops onto transports , and sailed for Roat\u00e1n on March 12 , escorted by three frigates ( Santa Matilde , the Santa Cecilia , and the Antiope ) and a number of smaller armed naval vessels , under the command of Commodore Enrique Macdonell . The British residents of Roat\u00e1n were aware of the ongoing Spanish military activities . The main settlement , New Port Royal , was defended by Forts Dalling and Despard , which mounted 20 guns . The island 's white non-slave population was however quite small . In 1781 they appealed to the British commander at Bluefields for support , but he was only able to send additional weapons , which did not add significantly to the island 's defenses . = = Battle = = The Spanish fleet arrived off Roat\u00e1n early on March 13 , and , after its defenders fired several ineffectual cannon shots , anchored out of range while G\u00e1lvez sent a party in to request the surrender of the island 's defenders . The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options , which G\u00e1lvez granted . After that time had elapsed , the defenders indicated that they were prepared to stand their ground , and refused to surrender . Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas , so G\u00e1lvez then held council , and a plan of attack was formulated . At about 10 : 15 am on March 16 , Spanish guns opened up against Forts Dalling and Despard , which guarded the mouth of New Port Royal 's harbour . By 1 : 00 pm the British guns there had been silenced , and Major General Gabriel Herbias began landing troops . After the two forts were secured , the Spanish warships entered the harbour and began raking the town with cannon fire , while British artillery fired back from positions in the hills above the town . This exchange continued until sunset , at which point the British defenders capitulated . The Spanish had two killed and four wounded in the battle , while only two slaves were wounded on the other side . = = Aftermath = = Terms of surrender were agreed the next day . G\u00e1lvez and his men remained on the island for several days , collecting weapons , rounding up slaves that had run away , destroying all the buildings and agriculture on the island , as well as burning many of the ships in the harbour , which they assumed to be used in smuggling and other illicit trade . The Spanish left the island on March 23 , carrying as prisoners of war 81 British soldiers , 300 slaves , and 135 British civilians . The prisoners were sent to Havana , where the slaves were auctioned off and the others held until they could be exchanged . G\u00e1lvez was able to only temporarily partially eliminate British influences in the area . He followed up his success at Roat\u00e1n with the capture of Black River in early April , but any attempt to advance further bogged down . James Lawrie , the commander at Black River , and Edward Marcus Despard successfully recaptured Black River , and were able to hold it until the end of the war .",

                    "text": "Pyrrhus ' invasion of the Peloponnese = Pyrrhus ' invasion of the Peloponnese in 272 BC was an invasion of south Greece by Pyrrhus , King of Epirus . He was opposed by Macedon and a coalition of Greek city-states ( poleis ) , most notably Sparta . The war ended in a joint victory by Macedonia and Sparta . After being defeated by the Roman Republic in the Pyrrhic War in 275 BC , Pyrrhus ( r . 297 \u2013 272 BC ) decided to turn his attention to Greece . He declared war on Antigonus Gonatas ( r . 283 \u2013 239 BC ) of Macedon and in a rapid campaign , managed to defeat him and make himself king of Macedon . In 272 BC , Pyrrhus agreed to assist the disgruntled Spartan prince , Cleonymus , who requested his assistance in securing the Spartan throne . Pyrrhus advanced with his army through central Greece and upon reaching the Peloponnese , he marched against Sparta . The city was sparsely defended at the time as the majority of its army had been taken to Crete by King Areus I ( r . 309 \u2013 265 BC ) . The Spartans led by Crown Prince Acrotatus were able to withstand a series of Epiriote assaults until Macedonian reinforcements and Areus ' army arrived to relieve the defenders . Following the arrival of the relieving force , Pyrrhus lifted the siege and prepared to winter in Laconia . However , he was approached by an Argive citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of Argos . Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity , Antigonus took his army to Argos , being harried along the way by the Spartans . Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night , Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus ' Macedonians . In the ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e , Pyrrhus was slain . His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece . = = Prelude = = Following entreaties from the Greek polis of Tarentum in 281 BC , Pyrrhus , the king of Epirus in northern Greece , invaded Italy with an army of 25,500 and 20 war elephants . The aim of the expedition was to combat the aggression of the Roman Republic , which was increasingly annexing the Greek cities of Magna Graecia . Upon arriving in Italy in 280 BC , Pyrrhus assumed command of an army consisting of the Greeks of Magna Graecia . Adding these forces to his own from Epirus , he engaged and defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea , near Tarentum in 280 BC . The Epiriote victory caused a number of native groups such as the Samnites and the Lucanians , who were also fearful of Roman expansionism to join Pyrrhus . Subsequently , Pyrrhus advanced towards Rome and at the Battle of Asculum he vanquished another Roman army . Despite having bested the Romans in their battles , Pyrrhus had sustained heavy casualties . With his Italian allies wavering , Pyrrhus decided to abandon his campaign against Rome . At this point in time , Pyrrhus had two options available . Firstly , he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant by the death of King Ptolemy Keraunos at the hands of the Gallic invaders of Greece . Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC . Alternatively , he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression . Ultimately , in 278 BC , Pyrrhus decided to direct his army against the Carthaginians in Sicily . Pyrrhus was highly successful in his campaign against Carthage and by 275 BC had managed to restrict them to the settlement of Lilybaeum in the far west of the island . Despite these victories , Pyrrhus ' despotic disposition and pretensions alienated his Sicilian allies who began to abandon him . In light of these developments , Pyrrhus decided to return to mainland Italy to continue his war against Rome . The Epiriotes attacked the Roman army but after the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum , he returned to Epirus . Despite Pyrrhus leaving a garrison there , Tarentum succumbed to Rome in 272 BC . = = War against Macedon = = On his return to his homeland , Pyrrhus found himself in a difficult position . His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army , leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment . In order to secure funds to pay his troops , Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas , the new king of Macedon . Citing Antigonus ' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli , Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC . He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries . It has been speculated that by invading Macedon , Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt , Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II , however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely . Initially , Pyrrhus had simply viewed his incursion into Macedon as an opportunity to plunder . However , the capture of numerous towns and the defection to his side of 2,000 Macedonian soldiers caused him to make his objective the seizure of the Macedonian throne . Antignous marched with his army to western Macedon and was confronted by Pyrrhus at the Battle of the Aous . Pyrrhus began the engagements by slaughtering Antigonus ' Gallic rearguard before securing the surrender of the Macedonian war elephants . Demoralised by these sudden reverses , the Macedonian phalangites responded to Pyrrhus ' appeals and defected to the Epiriote side . Abandoned by his army , Antigonus managed to escape to Thessaloniki with a small force of cavalry . He was able to entrench himself there , protected by his strong navy which enabled him to maintain links with his possessions in southern Greece . Antigonus ' flight left Pyrrhus in complete control of the Macedonian hinterland and Thessaly in central Greece . However , not all of Macedon surrendered to the Epiriote king and he was compelled to send his general , the Spartan Prince Cleonymus to capture Edessa . Despite initially being welcomed with enthusiasm by the Macedonians , he managed to alienate his new subjects when his Gallic troops ransacked the royal Macedonian tombs at Vergina . By late 274 BC or early 273 BC , Pyrrhus secured the occupation of Macedonia and returned to Epirus , leaving his son Ptolemy to govern the region . = = Advance into the Peloponnese = = Following his Macedonian triumph , Pyrrhus was approached by his officer Cleonymus . The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland . Cleonymus ' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold . Firstly , he was angry that he had been overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew , Areus II . Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus ' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature . Furthermore , Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife , Chilonis , was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus , the son of Areus . Pyrrhus ' motivation for agreeing to assist Cleonymus is more complex . By installing Cleonymus on the throne , the Epiriote would secure Sparta as an ally . Additionally , by invading the Peloponnese , Pyrrhus would be able to subdue any cities which had remained loyal to Antigonus . In doing so , he could prevent Antigonus using the peninsula as a base from which to launch a counter-attack on Macedon . The size of the force assembled by Pyrrhus is indicative of his intention to extend his hegemony into the Peloponnese . The Epiriote king mustered an army consisting of 25,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry as well as 24 war elephants . In 272 BC , Pyrrhus marched his army through Central Greece to the city of Pleuron from where they were ferried across the Gulf of Corinth to the Peloponnese . This suggests that the invasion was supported by the Aetolian League , a powerful confederate in Central Greece which was allied with Pyrrhus and hostile to Antigonus . Antigonus attempted to exploit Pyrrhus ' absence from Macedon by launching an invasion to reclaim his kingdom . However , his attack on Macedon was unsuccessful as he was defeated in battle by Pyrrhus ' son , Ptolemy . Unperturbed by Antigonus ' offensive , Pyrrhus advanced into the Peloponnese where he was welcomed in Achaia . The Epiriote army marched to Megalopolis , a central Peloponnesian city which lay on the border with Sparta . Several of Sparta 's neighbours , namely Megalopolis , Elis and many of the Achaians poleis , supported Pyrrhus invasion as they would profit from the reduction of Spartan influence in the region . While his force was camped at Megalopolis , Pyrrhus received ambassadors from Messene , Athens , the Achaian League and Sparta . In response to the Spartans ' inquires as to the reasons for his Peloponnesian incursion , Pyrrhus managed to dupe the envoys . He told the Spartans that he had come to liberate any cities still held by Antigonus and that he hoped to send his sons to Sparta to obtain a traditional education at the agoge . However , when the emissaries returned to Sparta , Pyrrhus advanced into Laconia . He advanced south , following the course of the Eurotas River and ravaging the lands of the Spartan perioeci . It may have been at this time that Pyrrhus assigned Cleonymus a series of independent commands as he is recorded as subjugating the city of Alifeira in Elis as well as sacking Zarax in the Parnon region of Laconia . Pyrrhus ' perfidy was met with anger in Sparta and ambassadors were immediately sent to Pyrrhus to rebuke him . = = Siege of Sparta = = The Spartans were caught unawares by Pyrrhus ' invasion . Areus had taken the majority of the Spartan army with him to Crete , where he was campaigning on behalf of Gortyn at the request of Ptolemaic Egypt . The result was that the settlement was lightly defended . Arriving at Sparta as night fell , Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack the city immediately . However , the Epiriote declined to as he was fearful of the damage that would be wrought by Gallic troops if they entered the city at night and moreover expected the sparsely defended city to surrender in the morning . The Spartan council of Elders , the gerousia , suggested that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection . They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia , the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city 's defence . In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest , the women and the elderly began bolstering defences . Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him , the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance . Moreover , messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus , despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile . Pausanias , the Greek geographer , claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos . The Epiriotes launched their first assault against the city at daybreak . However , they were unable to get a firm footing because of the trench and were repulsed by the defenders , who were encouraged by the women . In order to circumvent this obstacle . Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and Chaonians commanded by Ptolemy to attempt to go around the trench . Finding their path blocked by the wagons , they began to pulling them out of the ground . Aware of the danger , Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into the trench after inflicting heavy casualties upon them . Unable to make an impact on the defences , Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall . After receiving a favourable omen during the night Pyrrhus renewed his assault . An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded . In an attempt to nullify the Spartans ' advantage , the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta . Responding to this Spartan counter-attack , Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city , spreading panic amongst the defenders . However , at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly . Pyrrhus ' fall threw his companions into a state of dismay , permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles . Despite this , Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp . Prompted by this unsuccessful foray , Pyrrhus order his army to return to its camp . He now expected the Spartans seek terms as the severity of their casualties would make the defence unsustainable . However , Sparta was saved by the arrival of unexpected reinforcements . In the interim , Antigonus had launched another offensive in northern Greece and succeeded in evicting Pyrrhus ' garrisons from Macedon ( this possibly accounts for the presence of Ptolemy in Pyrrhus ' army ) . Having reclaimed his kingdom , Antigonus moved south into the Peloponnese , probably using the sea route to avoid a confrontation with the Aetolian League . Upon his arrival in Corinth , he sent his general Ameinias the Phocian with a group of mercenaries to assist the Spartans . The arrival of the Macedonia mercenaries was closely followed by Areus ' return from Crete with 2,000 men . Enheartened by the arrival of these reinforcements , the defenders prepared to face Pyrrhus ' next assault . The Epiriotes launched an attack in the morning but after this was repelled Pyrrhus became convinced of the futility of the situation and ordered his men to lift the siege . = = March to Argos = = Pyrrhus retreated with his army into the Laconian hinterland with the purpose of wintering there before making another attempt against Sparta . However , as his troops were ravaging the surrounding countryside , he received news that Antigonus was marching on Argos from Corinth on his way to trap Pyrrhus in Laconia . Pyrrhus was approached by Aristeas , the leader of the democratic faction in Argos , who sought Epiriote support to counter the pro-Macedonian aristocratic party of Argos led by Aristippos . Accepting Aristeas ' proposal , Pyrrhus began his march north to the Argolis . Pyrrhus ' advance on Argos did not go smoothly as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus . By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat , the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus ' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians . In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear , Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command . Pyrrhus hoped that the presence of his son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable to him to extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing . Ptolemy 's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus . In the ensuing struggle , Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout . The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry . Upon hearing of his son 's death and the collapse of his rearguard , Pyrrhus summoned his Molossian cavalry and charged the Spartans . In the battle that followed , Pyrrhus killed the Spartan leader Evaclus with his own hand and succeeded in annihilating the pursuing Spartan troops . After this skirmish , the Epiriotes continued their march to Argos . However , upon reaching his destination , he found that Antigonus had arrived at Argos first and camped to the city 's north . The Macedonian presence compelled Pyrrhus to pitch camp at Nauplion to the south of Argos . Pyrrhus attempted to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched battle on the plain in front of Argos but the Macedonian king was unmoved . The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings , beseeching them to respect the city 's neutrality . Antigonus agreed to the Argives ' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity . While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos , he failed to give a pledge and as a result was regarded with suspicion . = = Battle of Argos = = During the night , Pyrrhus was able to enter Argos . While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force , Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas . Hammond opines that it is more likely that Aristeas admitted Pyrrhus into the city . Although Pyrrhus ' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora , the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate . In order for them to enter , the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city . Furthermore , Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus . This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel , the Aspis , and seek aid from Antigonus . The Macedonian king responded immediately , advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus . The situation further deteriorated for Pyrrhus when Areus entered Argos with a force of 1,000 lightly armed Cretans and Spartans . The Argives , assisted by their Spartan and Macedonian allies , launched a counter-attack on Pyrrhus ' Gallic troops in the agora and threw them into a state of panic . Due to the labyrinthine layout of the city and the darkness , both Pyrrhus ' advancing troops and those of his opponents become scattered throughout Argos . The result was that Pyrrhus , entering the city at the head of his cavalry to assist the Gauls , was unable to effectively communicate his commands to his soldiers . Realising the difficulty of his situation , Pyrrhus ordered his army to retreat from Argos as day broke . Understanding that the gates were too narrow for his army to exit in an orderly fashion , Pyrrhus ordered Helenus to tear down part of the wall and to be prepared to fend off any enemy counter-attacks against the retreating troops . However , the instructions brought by the messenger were unclear and instead of organising the retreat , Helenus advanced with the rest of the army into Argos . With the majority of his troops streaming in through the gates , Pyrrhus ' line of retreat was blocked off . The disorder was exacerbated when Pyrrhus ' largest elephant fell and blocked the gateway and another elephant started running amok after his mahout was felled . The weight of the enemy 's assault pushed Pyrrhus and his troops from the agora and compelled them to fight in the narrow street leading to the Diamperes Gate . In the fighting which ensued , Pyrrhus was wounded by a spear wielded by an Argive . As Pyrrhus turned to strike down his assailant , he was hit on the head by a roof tile thrown by his attacker 's mother . Pyrrhus was either killed by the force of the tile 's impact or , alternately , having fallen dazed from his horse he was decapitated by one of Antigonus ' Macedonian soldiers , Zopyrus . Pyrrhus ' head was brought by Halcyoneus to Antigonus , who expressed dismay when he saw it and upbraided his son for acting in such a barbarous manner . Upon Pyrrhus ' death , Epiriote resistance crumbled and Antigonus accepted the surrender of Helenus , giving him Pyrrhus ' body for burial . = = Aftermath = = The expedition into the Peloponnese was a disaster for Epiriote ambitions . Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus to return to his homeland with the remainder of his army , Epirus ceased to be a regional power . Pyrrhus ' son and successor , Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king . Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus ' conquests of Tymphaea , Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon . Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north . Antigonus emerged from the conflict as the unchallenged ruler of Macedon and the leading power in Greece . After his victory in Argos , Antigonus was able to install his supporter Aristippos as tyrant of the city and appointed various pro-Macedonian leaders as tyrants in other Greek cities . His support for tyrants over democratic rulers would lead to growing resentment amongst the Greek cities against Macedon . On his journey north to Macedon , Antigonus succeeded in placing garrisons in the cities of Chalcis and Eretria on the important island of Euboia with the outcome being that he further consolidated his power in Greece . The Spartan-Macedon alliance proved to be transient . Angered by Macedon 's supremacy and full of ambition , Areus formed a coalition with several Greek poleis , most notably Athens . In the resulting Chremonidean War , Areus was slain by his former ally Antigonus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC . The war ended in a defeat that was so crushing for Sparta that it would not rise as a regional power again until the reign of Cleomenes III thirty years later . = = = Ancient sources = = = Pausanias ; Jones , W.

                    "text": "Battle of the Lippe = The Battle of the Lippe was a cavalry action fought on 2 September 1595 on the banks of the Lippe river , in Germany , between a corps of Spanish cavalry led by Juan de C\u00f3rdoba and a corps of Dutch cavalry , supported by English troops , led by Philip of Nassau . The Dutch statholder Maurice of Nassau , taking advantage of the fact that the bulk of the Spanish army was busied in operations in France , besieged the town of Groenlo in Gelderland , but the elderly governor of the citadel of Antwerp , Crist\u00f3bal de Mondrag\u00f3n , organized a relief army and forced Maurice to lift the siege . Mondrag\u00f3n next moved to Wesel , positioning his troops on the southern bank of the Lippe river to cover Rheinberg from a Dutch attack . Maurice aimed then , relying on his superior army , to entice Mondrag\u00f3n into a pitched battle , planning to use an ambush to draw the Spanish army into a trap . However , the plan was discovered by the Spanish commander , who organized a counter-ambush . The Dutch intended to overtake a Spanish foraging convoy and deliver it into their camp in order to draw the Spanish army in pursuit to the banks of the Lippe , where Maurice was awaiting with the Dutch States Army in order of battle . However , Mondrag\u00f3n reinforced the escort of the convoy and hid a large force of cavalry in a wood nearby under his lieutenant Juan de C\u00f3rdoba . Thanks to Mondrag\u00f3n 's long experience , the Spanish routed the Dutch force and inflicted a number of casualties upon Philip of Nassau 's men , including himself and several other high-ranking Dutch and English officers in the Dutch army . = = Background = = In 1595 , Henry IV of France declared war on Spain in response to Philip II 's continued support of the Catholic League of France , and formed an alliance with Elizabeth I of England and the Dutch Republic , who were engaged in their own wars against the Spanish Crown . The Catholic Netherlands were , consequently , caught between two fronts , and French and Dutch forces even tried to create a corridor linking their respective states through the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge . The new Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands , the Count of Fuentes , directed his efforts against Picardy and Cambr\u00e9sis , leaving a few troops to defend the loyal provinces from a Dutch attack . In July , while Fuentes was busied in the siege of Doullens , Maurice of Nassau , statholder of the Dutch Republic , assembled a force of 6,000 infantry , some cavalry companies and 16 artillery pieces of the Dutch States Army , and led them under the walls of Groenlo , a medium-sized town in the County of Zutphen . Its northern flank defended by the Slinge , a stream of the Berkel river , Groenlo was fortified with five bulwarks and garrisoned by 11 infantry companies from Count Herman van den Bergh 's regiment numbering 600 troops under Jan van Stirum , a German officer , and four small artillery pieces . On receiving news of the siege , Crist\u00f3bal de Mondrag\u00f3n , the elderly Spanish governor of Antwerp , whom Fuentes had left in command of the Spanish forces opposite to the Dutch , collected a little army gathering forces of several garrisons and marched to Groenlo through Brabant and Gelderland . Mondrag\u00f3n 's force comprised two Spanish tercios ( under Luis de Velasco and Antonio de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga ) , an Irish regiment under William Stanley , a Swiss regiment and 1,300 cavalry under Juan de C\u00f3rdoba , which , having crossed the Meuse at Venlo , were joined by Frederick van den Bergh 's German regiment . At over 80 , Mondrag\u00f3n was still able to mount on horseback , though he had to be helped by two men and could only wear light armour . He first came to prominence at the Battle of M\u00fchlberg , in 1547 , and was one of the few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces , being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft . Mondrag\u00f3n planned not only to relieve Groenlo , but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle . The Dutch general , however , on receiving news of his enemy 's march , set fire to supplies , tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo . Mondrag\u00f3n could therefore ressuply the town unmolested . = = Prelude = = After Groenlo was secured , Mondrag\u00f3n marched south to Rheinberg to cover the town from a Dutch attack . He encamped his army near Wesel , at Dinslaken , while Maurice followed him and took up positions at Bislich , both armies being separated by the Lippe river . The Spanish position was strong ; the rearguard and the left flank covered by the Rhine and the right flank by the Lippe and a range of moorland hills called Testerburg . For several weeks both armies looked at each other , often skirmishing when both cavalries sallied to forage . As time passed , the Spanish foragers were forced to look for victuals two or three leagues far away from their camp . Maurice took the opportunity to plan a mock ambush on Mondrag\u00f3n 's foraging convoy aiming to lure him into a general action in which he could destroy the Spanish army . Mondrag\u00f3n also hoped to lure his enemy into a trap . On 1 September , Maurice gave the command of the ambush to his favourite commander , his cousin Philip of Nassau . Maurice instructed him to cross the Lippe river the following day at dawn , hide in a wood next to which the Spanish convoy was expected to pass , and fall on its guard . Maurice 's goal was to seize the foraging convoy , separate it from the escort and lead it to the Dutch camp , thus forcing Mondrag\u00f3n to intervene with a larger force . Then , after the appearance of Mondrag\u00f3n with the main army , Nassau was to retreat to the Dutch camp , thus luring the Spanish army into an ambush . For his task , Nassau received the command of some 500 or 700 Dutch and English horsemen and was accompanied by his two brothers , Ernst Casimir and Ludwig Gunther , as well as several other Dutch officers , Count Ernst of Solms , Paul and Marcellus Bacx , and the English captains Nicholas Parker , Cutler and Robert Vere . The Dutch intentions were anticipated by the Spanish . According to Joseph de La Pise , a French jurist hired by Maurice 's half brother and successor Frederick Henry to write a history of the Princes of Orange , Mondrag\u00f3n had learned of the ambush from English soldiers who had deserted from the Dutch colours , but the Italian Jesuit Angello Gallucci claims that it was Spanish spies who informed Mondrag\u00f3n , who had used spies to gather information on the enemy since the siege of Zierikzee , in 1576 . In any case , the Spanish general took measures to turn Nassau 's surprise into a trap . The convoy , normally guarded by 300 infantry and 150 cavalry , was reinforced by 300 musketeers and a large force of cavalry under Mondrag\u00f3n 's lieutenant , Juan de C\u00f3rdoba . = = Action = = On 2 September , at dawn , the Dutch force crossed the Lippe across a pontoon bridge . Maurice awaited them with 5,000 infantry and the rest of his cavalry arranged for the battle in the hills near Wesel , along the opposite riverbank . Philip of Nassau divided his troops into four squadrons : the first one of 125 men under the drossaard of Sallandt , the second one of 125 men under the Count of Kinsky , the third one , those in which Nassau and his brothers marched , of 150 soldiers under Lieutenant Balen , and the last , closing the way , of 120 men under the English captain Nicholas Parker . Having arrived at Krudenburg , Nassau sent 40 chosen men from the companies led by Balen to surprise the foraging horses . On finding a force much larger than they expected , the Dutch officers thought that something was wrong and sent a report back to Philip of Nassau . The Dutch commander , nevertheless , believed that it was only the convoy 's escort and moved on with his troops and his entourage to attack the Spanish cavalry , aiming to prevent its escape . The Dutch officers ' report was not mistaken : early in the morning , two Spanish scouts had found the track of the Dutch force crossing the river , and Mondrag\u00f3n , anticipating them , had deployed his cavalry beyond a beechwood , the countryside southwards the Lippe being covered by small woods alternating with moorlands . Besides the troops guarding the convoy , Juan de C\u00f3rdoba had the command of at least seven cavalry companies : those of Hendrik van den Bergh , Girolamo Caraffa , Carlo Maria Caracciolo , Paulo Emilio Martinengo , his own company , ' s-Hertogenbosch lances under Adolf van den Bergh and Sancho de Leyva 's company . Other authors also list Alonso Mendo 's company . Mondrag\u00f3n had informed the guard of the convoy of the Dutch intentions and encouraged the soldiers to hold their ground , promising them that he was behind them with the whole Spanish army to come in relief . Commanding 75 lances from Kinsky 's company , and followed by the bulk of his force , Nassau passed through a narrow path in a small forest , and , coming out to open field , was surprised by the Spanish troops , namely by those under Hendrik van den Bergh , followed by Carlo Maria Caracciolo and the ' s-Hertogenbosch lances . Van den Bergh 's harquebusiers , discovering the Dutch column emerging from the forest , fired a volley and , turning right , clashed with the Dutch scouts , starting the action . There was then a firece fight . The Dutch troops were formed into eight squadrons , but caught by surprise in a narrow passage , the Dutch soldiers were unable to use their lances , so they were forced to defend themselves with swords and pistols . Philip of Nassau , his brothers and their cousin Ernst von Solms were seriously wounded and dismounted at the beginning the fight . Kinsky 's and Balen 's troops , coming in relief , were unable to rescue the wounded commanders , and some Dutch soldiers started to flee from the battlefield . Nicholas Parker , however , managed to collect the fugitives and , renewing the action , he put disorder into the Spanish cavalry . The encounter turned then a general action out the wood , in open ground . At first the Dutch were winning the action , but after they put in disorder two or three Spanish squadrons , Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron , which allowed C\u00f3rdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack , this time with success . Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the Dutch troops , they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion , attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river . C\u00f3rdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up , and they found that some of the Dutch soldiers , having been unable to find a good place to ford the river , had drowned . The Spanish captives were freed , and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered . = = Aftermath = = The battle is noted for the heavy death toll among the Dutch commanders . Philip of Nassau was mortally wounded at the beginning of the action , shot at point blank range through the body with an harquebus , his robes being set on fire . Robert Vere , brother of the English colonel Horace Vere , was slain by a lance thrust in the face . The drossaard of Zallandt and Count Ferdinand Kinsky were also killed . Count Ernst of Solms was seriously wounded and captured . Together with Philip , he was carried to Rheinberg , where both soldiers were visited by Mondrag\u00f3n and their Catholic cousins , the Van den Bergh brothers , and treated by the Spanish surgeons . Despite all the attentions , both Dutch commanders died of the wounds they had sustained ; Nassau the night after the battle , and Solms three days later . Count Ernst Casimir was captured and ransomed for 10,000 florins . Mondrag\u00f3n dispatched him to Maurice of Nassau with the bodies of the dead counts , which were buried with honours at Arnhem . As for the battle losses , sources vary . The Flemish Protestant Guillaume Baudart set Dutch losses at 88 horses , 83 prisoners and 24 killed . The Italian Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio claimed that more than 300 Dutch soldiers were slain as opposed to about 60 Spanish casualties . The Roman Jesuit Angelo Gallucci also wrote of 300 Dutch casualties . The Spanish soldier and writer Carlos Coloma set the Spanish loss as 19 men killed and claimed that the Dutch force lost three flags and about 400 serviceable horses . On the Spanish side the only soldiers of note among the casualties were Caraffa , Martinengo and Caracciolo , all of whom were wounded , but not mortally . Joseph de La Pise stated that the Dutch took seven Spanish prisoners and 15 horses . According to Antonio Carnero , accountant in the Spanish army , an envoy of the King of France to the Dutch camp was present at the battle and found later among the fatalities . The English author Edward Grimeston wrote , in his book A General History of the Netherlands , that the battle of the Lippe \" was a pettie battaile of young and hot blouds , who prooved but bad Marchants that got nothing \" . Even though it was only a small battle , it was celebrated joyfully at the Spanish camp before Cambrai . Three salvos were fired upon the city by 87 artillery pieces and 6,000 muskets and arquebuses . The North-American historian John Lothrop Motley highlighted the key role played by the 91-year-old Mondrag\u00f3n in the Spanish victory : This skirmish on the Lippe has no special significance in a military point of view , but it derives more than a passing interest , not only from the death of many a brave and distinguished soldier , but for the illustration of human vigour triumphing , both physically and mentally , over the infirmities of old age , given by the achievement of Christopher Mondragon . Alone he had planned his expedition across the country from Antwerp , alone he had insisted on crossing the Rhine , while younger soldiers hesitated ; alone , with his own active brain and busy hands , he had outwitted the famous young chieftain of the Netherlands , counteracted his subtle policy , and set the counter-ambush by which his choicest cavalry were cut to pieces , and one of his bravest generals slain . So far could the icy blood of ninety-two prevail against the vigour of twenty-eight . The Spanish and Dutch armies spent 16 more days observing each other from their encampments , but no action of importance ensued . Maurice of Nassau laid a bridge over the Rhine and tried to take Meurs by surprise , but the enterprise was discovered . He also committed Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg to intercept five Spanish companies sent by Mondrag\u00f3n to lodge in Twente , but the Spaniards managed to reach Enschede , leaving only a few chariots with supplies in Dutch hands . On 11 October , lacking of forage , Mondrag\u00f3n retired back to Brabant . Maurice aimed to cut off his retreat , but the Spaniard succeeded in bringing his troops to a secure position . Mondrag\u00f3n re-crossed the Meuse in November and distributed his troops in different towns . Before crossing the river the Swiss mercenaries were paid and liscended . On 4 January 1596 , the elderly general died in the citadel of Antwerp . On his deathbed he wrote a letter to Philip II asking for the castellany of Antwerp for his son Alonso and a company of lances for his grandson Crist\u00f3bal , but both requests were denied .",

                    "text": "Battle of the Assunpink Creek = The Battle of the Assunpink Creek , also known as the Second Battle of Trenton , was a battle between American and British troops that took place in and around Trenton , New Jersey , on January 2 , 1777 , during the American Revolutionary War , and resulted in an American victory . Following a surprise victory at the Battle of Trenton early in the morning of December 26 , 1776 , General George Washington of the Continental Army and his council of war expected a strong British counter-attack . Washington and the council decided to meet this attack in Trenton , and established a defensive position south of the Assunpink Creek . Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led the British forces southward in the aftermath of the December 26 battle . Leaving 1,400 men under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton , Cornwallis advanced on Trenton with about 5,000 men on January 2 . His advance was significantly slowed by defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward Hand , and the advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight . After assaulting the American positions three times , and being repulsed each time , Cornwallis decided to wait and finish the battle the next day . Washington moved his army around Cornwallis 's camp that night and attacked Mawhood at Princeton the next day . That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter . = = Background = = On the night of December 25 \u2013 26 , 1776 , George Washington , Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army crossed the Delaware River with his army , and attacked the Hessian garrison at Trenton on the morning of December 26 . The Hessian garrison was surrounded and quickly defeated . Washington crossed the river again and returned to his camp in Pennsylvania that afternoon . On December 30 , Washington moved his army back to Trenton and stationed his men on the south side of the Assunpink Creek . = = Prelude = = = = = Washington 's appeal = = = At Trenton Washington faced a dilemma . All but a handful of his men 's enlistments were expiring on December 31 , and he knew that the army would collapse unless he convinced them to stay . So , on the 30th , Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars . He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks , but not a man turned out . Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops , saying \" My brave fellows , you have done all I asked you to do , and more than could be reasonably expected ; but your country is at stake , your wives , your houses and all that you hold dear . You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships , but we know not how to spare you . If you will consent to stay only one month longer , you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances . \" At first no one stepped forward , but then one soldier stepped forward , and he was followed by most of the others , leaving only a few in the original line . = = = Preparations = = = On January 1 , money from Congress arrived in Trenton and the men were paid . Washington also received a series of resolves from Congress including one that gave Washington powers similar to those of a military dictator . Washington decided that he would stand and fight at Trenton , and ordered General John Cadwalader , who was at Crosswicks with 1,800 militia , to join him in Trenton . On December 31 Washington learned that an army of 8,000 men under the command of General Charles Cornwallis was moving to attack him at Trenton . Washington ordered his men to build earthworks that were parallel to the south bank of the Assunpink Creek . The lines extended about three miles ( 4.8 km ) down the south end of the stream . However , one of Washington 's aides , Joseph Reed , pointed out that there were fords up stream that the British could cross , and then they would be in position to drive in Washington 's right flank . Washington could not escape across the Delaware because all of his boats were a few miles upstream . Washington told his officers that he planned to move the army and that their current position was only temporary . = = = British movement = = = Cornwallis , who had been planning to return to Britain , had his leave canceled . He rode to Princeton to catch up with General James Grant , who had moved with 1,000 troops to reinforce Princeton . Cornwallis arrived , and was convinced by Grant and Carl von Donop to attack Trenton with their combined forces . By January 1 , 1777 , Cornwallis and his army had reached Princeton . On January 2 , Cornwallis left part of his force there under the command of Charles Mawhood , and with 5,500 men , set off down the road to Trenton , 11 miles ( 18 km ) away . Cornwallis 's army had 28 cannon and marched in three columns . When Cornwallis reached Maidenhead , he detached Colonel Alexander Leslie with 1,500 men and ordered them to remain there until the following morning . = = The battle = = = = = Delaying actions = = = Out in front of his army , Cornwallis placed a skirmish line of Hessian j\u00e4gers and British light infantry . Two days before , Washington had troops under the command of Matthias Alexis Roche de Fermoy place an outer defensive line halfway between Trenton and Princeton , with the goal of delaying the British advance . As the British approached , Fermoy returned to Trenton , drunk . Colonel Edward Hand took over his command . As the British came within range , the American riflemen opened fire . The American riflemen took cover in the woods , ravines and even in bends in the road , and each time the British would line up in a battle line , the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover . After Hand was forced to abandon the American position along Five Mile Run , he took up a new position , a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek . Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream . The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range . The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines , bringing up their cannon . The British searched the woods for a half an hour looking for the Americans , but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position . By three in the afternoon , the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow , about a half a mile ( 0.8 km ) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense . Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall , when darkness would prevent the British from attacking his defenses on the south side of Assunpink Creek . The British , with artillery in position , attacked Hand 's new position , and he gave way , slowly falling back into Trenton . Along the way , Hand had his troops fire from behind houses . As Hand 's troops came to the creek , the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed , causing chaos among the Americans . Washington , seeing the chaos , rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge , and shouted that Hand 's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery . = = = British assault = = = As the British prepared to attack the American defenses , cannon and musket fire was exchanged between the opposing sides . The British moved across the bridge , advancing in solid columns , and the Americans all fired together . The British fell back , but only for a moment . The British charged the bridge again , but were driven back by cannon fire . The British charged one final time , but the Americans fired canister shot this time , and the British lines were raked with fire . One soldier said , \" The bridge looked red as blood , with their killed and wounded and their red coats . \" = = American withdrawal = = = = = Cornwallis ' decision = = = When Cornwallis arrived in Trenton with the main army , he called a council of war as to whether or not he should continue to attack . Cornwallis ' quartermaster general , William Erskine , urged Cornwallis to strike right away , saying \" If Washington is the General I take him to be , his army will not be found there in the morning . \" But James Grant disagreed , and argued that there was no way for the Americans to retreat , and that the British troops were worn out , and that it would be better for them to attack in the morning after they had rested . Cornwallis did not want to wait until morning , but he decided that it would be better than sending his troops out to attack in the dark . Cornwallis said , \" We 've got the old fox safe now . We 'll go over and bag him in the morning . \" Cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of Trenton for the night . = = = Washington 's decision = = = During the night , the American artillery , under the command of Henry Knox , occasionally fired shells into Trenton to keep the British on edge . As Cornwallis had , Washington also called for a council of war . Using the road leading to Princeton , and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there . By 2 am the army was on its way to Princeton . Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in . By morning , these men too had evacuated , and when the British came to attack , all of the American troops were gone . = = Casualties = = Casualty estimates are widely divergent . Howard Peckham records the fighting on January 2 as two separate engagements , both of which he categorizes as \" skirmishes \" . In the first , at Five Mile Run , he gives no American losses . In the second , at Stockton Hollow , he gives the American casualties as 6 killed , 10 wounded and 1 deserted . William S. Stryker , on the other hand , gives the entire American loss on January 2 as 1 killed and 6 wounded , while David Hackett Fischer says that they had 100 killed and wounded . Peckham gives the British losses at Five Mile Run as 1 Hessian killed and those for Stockton Hollow as \" at least \" 10 killed , 20 wounded and 25 captured . Edward J. Lowell gives the Hessian losses on January 2 as 4 killed and 11 wounded . David Hackett Fischer gives the British casualties as 365 killed , wounded or captured . = = Aftermath = = By morning , Washington had reached Princeton . After a brief battle , the British there were decisively defeated and a substantial number of the garrison under command of Mawhood was captured . With their third defeat in ten days , Cornwallis ' superior , General William Howe ordered the army to withdraw from southern New Jersey and most of the way back to New York . This they did , leaving forward positions at New Brunswick . Washington moved his army to Morristown for winter quarters .",

                    "text": "Battle of St. Louis = The Battle of St. Louis , Spanish San Luis , also known as the Battle of Fort San Carlos , was an unsuccessful British-led attack on St. Louis ( a French settlement in Spanish Louisiana , founded on the west bank of the Mississippi , after the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) ) on May 26 , 1780 , during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1779 \u2013 1783 . A force , composed primarily of Indians and led by a former British militia commander , attacked the settlement . The settlement 's defenders , mostly local militia , under the command of Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Louisiana Fernando de Leyba , had fortified the town , as best they could and successfully withstood the attack . A second simultaneous attack on the nearby American outpost at Cahokia , on the opposite bank of the Mississippi and technically in British-controlled territory , was also repulsed . The retreating Indians destroyed crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area . The British failure effectively ended their attempts to gain control of the Mississippi River , during the war . = = Background = = Following the entry of Spain into the American Revolutionary War in 1779 , British military planners in London wanted to secure the corridor of the Mississippi River against both Spanish and Patriot activity . Their plans included expeditions from West Florida to take New Orleans and other Spanish targets , and several expeditions to gain control of targets in the upper Mississippi , including the small town of St. Louis . The expedition from West Florida never got off the ground , since Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez , the Governor of Spanish Louisiana , had moved rapidly to gain control of British outposts on the lower Mississippi , and was threatening action against West Florida 's principal outposts of Mobile and Pensacola . = = = British expedition = = = The British expeditions from the north were organized by Patrick Sinclair , the military governor at Fort Michilimackinac in present-day Michigan . Beginning in February 1780 he instructed fur traders to circulate through their territories , recruiting interested tribes for an expedition against St. Louis . The fur traders were offered the opportunity to control the fur trade in the upper parts of Spanish Louisiana as an incentive to participate . Most of the force gathered at Prairie du Chien , where they were placed under the command of Emanuel Hesse , a former militia captain turned fur trader . The force numbered about two dozen fur traders and an estimated 750 to 1,000 Indians when it left Prairie du Chien on May 2 . The largest contingent of the force was about 200 Sioux warriors led by Wapasha , with additional sizable companies from the Chippewa , Menominee , and Winnebago nations , and smaller numbers of warriors from other nations . The Chippewa chief Matchekewis was given overall command of the native forces . When the force reached Rock Island they were joined by about 250 men from the Sac and Fox nations . These warriors were somewhat reluctant to attack St. Louis , but Hesse gave them large gifts to secure their participation in the venture . The diversity within the expedition included some animosity among the tribes , for the Chippewa and Sioux in particular had a history of conflict with each other . However , Wapasha and Matchekewis promoted unity during the expedition . = = = Spanish and American defenses = = = The village of St. Louis was primarily a trading hub on the Mississippi River , but it was also the administrative capital of Upper Spanish Louisiana , and it was governed by Lieutenant Governor Fernando de Leyba , who was also a captain in the Spanish Army . Leyba was warned in late March 1780 by a fur trader that the British were planning an attack on St. Louis and the nearby American-held post at Cahokia . He began developing plans for the village 's defense . He had only 29 regular army soldiers of the Fijo de Luisiana Colonial Regiment and an inexperienced militia force of 168 , most of whom were dispersed in the surrounding countryside . Leyba developed a grand plan of defense that included the construction of four stone towers . Without funds , or the time to get them from New Orleans , Leyba asked the villagers to contribute funds and labor to the construction of these fortifications , and paid for some of the work from his private funds . By mid-May a single round tower had been built that was about 30 feet ( 9.1 m ) in diameter and thirty to forty feet tall . The tower , dubbed Fort San Carlos , provided a commanding view of the surrounding countryside . As there did not appear to be sufficient time to build more towers , trenches were dug between the tower and the river to the north and south of the village . Five cannon were placed on top of the tower , and additional cannon were placed along the trenches . With a force of only 197 men , 168 of which were inexperienced militia , it was highly probable that the opposing British-Indian force of 1,000 would overwhelm the Fort San Carlos . However , Leyba appealed to a 70 year old French habitant , Francois Valle , who was located 60 miles to the South of the fort at the site of the French Colonial Valles Mines . Valle sent his two sons and 151 well trained and equipped French militia men which tipped the scale in favor of the defenders . By Royal Decree on April 1 , 1782 , King Carlos III of Spain , conferred upon Francois Valle the rank of lieutenant in the regular Spanish army thus making him a Spanish don . ( citation : Colonial Ste . Genevieve : An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier written by Carl J. Ekberg , Patrice Pr ; 2 Sub Edition , March 1996 ) . Valle also greatly aided in the Battle of Fort San Carlos because he gave the defenders of both forts a major tactical advantage by supplying them with genuine lead ( instead of pebbles or stones ) from his mines for musket balls and cannonballs . Getting hit with a pebble or stone did not compare to the damage and knockdown power of a 52 caliber rifle ball at 100 feet . [ see http : / / en.wikipedia.org / France in the American Revolutionary War ] As a result of his contributions , Francois Valle was called the \" Defender of St. Louis \" [ see http : / / vallemines.com / OfHistoricalNote / DefenderOfStLouis.aspx ] . On May 15 , Leyba was visited by John Montgomery , the American commander at Cahokia , who proposed a joint Spanish-American force to counter Hesse 's expedition , an idea that did not reach fruition . On May 23 , Leyba 's scouts reported that Hesse 's force was only 14 miles ( 23 km ) away , had landed their canoes , and were coming overland . = = Battle = = On May 25 , Hesse sent out scouting parties to determine the situation at St. Louis . These parties were unable to get close to the village due to the presence of workers , including women and children , in the fields outside the village . The next day Hesse sent Jean-Marie Ducharme and 300 Indians across the river to attack Cahokia , while the remainder headed toward St. Louis , arriving about 1 : 00 pm . A warning shot was fired from the tower when they came in view , with the Sioux and Winnebagoes leading the way , followed by the Sac and Fox , and the fur traders , including Hesse , bringing up the rear . Leyba directed the defense from the tower , and opened a withering fire from there and the trenches when the enemy force came in range . On the first volley , most of the Sac and Fox fell back , apparently unwilling to fight , leaving many of the other participants suspicious of their motives in joining the expedition and complaining of their \" treachery \" . Wapasha and the Sioux persisted for several hours in attempts to draw the Spanish defenders out , going so far as brutally killing some captives they had taken in the fields . Although this angered some of the townspeople to the point where the militia requested permission to make a sortie , Leyba refused , and the attackers eventually withdrew and headed north , destroying crops , livestock , and buildings as they went . On the other side of the river , Ducharme 's attack on Cahokia was easily repulsed . The timely arrival of George Rogers Clark to lead its defense played a role ; Clark 's reputation as a frontier fighter made the Indian force reluctant to pursue the attack . = = Aftermath = = The village of 700 lost between 50 and 100 killed , wounded , and captured , virtually all civilians . A year later the Spaniards from St. Louis raided Fort St. Joseph , bringing the captured British flag back to St. Louis . Fernando de Leyba died the following month , the subject of local criticism because he never formally recognized the efforts made by the citizenry in the town 's defense . His valor earned him a promotion to lieutenant colonel from King Charles , who did not know that he had died . = = Legacy = = The site where Fort San Carlos stood is at the corner of Fourth and Walnut Streets in St. Louis . A local organization annually commemorates the battle by reading the names of 21 people who lost their lives in the battle . The battle is also remembered in a mural and diorama located in the Missouri State Capitol ( pictured ) .",

He fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars and died of fatigue at K\u00f6nigsberg in East Prussia on 21 December 1812 , during the Grand Army 's retreat from Moscow . A superb organizer and tactician , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re rose rapidly through the artillery ranks and reliably directed the artillery park for the initial engagements of the War of the First Coalition in 1793 \u2013 1794 . He also directed the investment and , if necessary , the sieges of Mainz , Ulm , and Danzig , among others . In addition , he was a reliable commander of infantry , supporting Laurent Saint-Cyr 's corps in northern Italy in the 1799 campaign . Lariboisi\u00e8re 's direction of artillery fire at the Battle of Austerlitz resulted in the destruction of the ice covering the lake over which Russian army forces retreated . His placement of artillery at the Battle of Borodino gave the French a tactical advantage in fire on the Russian lines . Lariboisi\u00e8re 's artillery also provided the rear guard coverage of the French withdrawal from Beresina . One of his sons survived the wars and the family founded the Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital in Paris . = = Family and education = = He was born on 18 August 1759 , in Foug\u00e8res . His father , Ambroise Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re , was lieutenant general of civil and criminal justice and the senechal of Foug\u00e8res . His mother was Jeanne Monni\u00e8res . Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re was designated early for a military career . He was a brilliant student at the military academy and in 1781 received a commission as a lieutenant and entered the same regiment as Napoleon Bonaparte . Although Lariboisi\u00e8re was a few years older than Bonaparte , they developed a rapport that continued until Lariboisi\u00e8re 's death in 1812 . = = Military career = = Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re was cited as a distinguished officer the outset of the French Revolution , for which he showed only moderate support . He was promoted to captain in 1791 and assigned to Adam Philippe , Comte de Custine 's command . He took part in the invasion of Paville against the Prussians . After the surrender of the French army , he was held as a prisoner of war . In the following years , he participated in the campaigns of 1796 , as adjutant colonel , colonel , and brigadier general , and directed the artillery parks of the Army of England , the Army of Helvetia , the Army of the Rhine . When Jean Baptiste Jourdan organized the Army of the Danube , Lariboisi\u00e8re received command of the artillery park . At the First Battle of Zurich , Lariboisi\u00e8re 's artillery defended the Zurich heights , which gave Andre Massena 's army enough time to evacuate the city and take position on the opposite side of the Limmat river . Afterward , Lariboisi\u00e8re was sent to northern Italy where he commanded the advance guard division ; Jean Victor Moreau 's right wing , with Lariboisi\u00e8re 's infantry and artillery , crossed the Ticino river at Pavia , marched up the left bank of the Po River and took position beneath Alessandria ; there , he protected Moreau 's flank from Russian skirmishers sufficiently for Moreau to establish a large train of artillery in Turin and to strengthen the French positions between the Po and the Tanaro river . At Battle of Novi , his division was part of Laurent Saint-Cyr 's right wing . At the battle itself , his troops were the only ones properly positioned ; the rest of the French army was otherwise out of place and unready for battle . He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line , beating off two Russian assaults . After the French defeat at Novi , he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona , where he participated in operations around Genoa . Eventually , he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany , culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden . = = = Napoleonic Wars = = = Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re commanded the artillery of the French IV Corps for the 1805 campaign of the War of the Third Coalition . He directed the investment of Ulm prior to its capitulation , and contributed to the success of Austerlitz . There he commanded the artillery attached to Soult corps . By firing on the ice of the lakes over which the Russian columns were retreating , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re 's artillery fire converted a Russian retreat into a full-scale rout : in the bombardment , French artillery pounded the soldiers and broke the ice . The men drowned in the cold ponds , dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down along with them . In the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re successfully repelled several infantry charges with artillery fire . Subsequently , Napoleon raised him to major general , and appointed him to command the artillery of the Imperial Guard at Battle of Eylau , in February 1807 . Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re remained throughout the day-long battle with a battery of 40 guns at the French center . After the campaigns of 1806 , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re briefly served as governor of Hanover . He later replaced General Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons prior to the engagements in northeastern Prussia in 1807 . At the Battle of Danzig , although wounded by a sniper 's bullet , he continued to direct the siege of the city . He directed the Imperial guard artillery for the battles of Heilsberg and Friedland ; after Friedland , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re organized the security of the raft on the Niemen river , where Napoleon and Alexander II of Russia conferred on the terms of the Peace of Tilsit . In February 1808 , General Lariboisi\u00e8re took command of the artillery of the Army of Spain . Recalled to the Grand Army in 1809 , Napoleon gave the command of the artillery at the Battle of Wagram . In 1811 Napoleon raised him to the post of first inspector general of ordnance \u2014 weaponry and ammunition . = = Russian campaign , 1812 = = In planning the Russian campaign , 1812 , Lariboisi\u00e8re immediately foresaw difficulties in transporting the requisite amount of artillery and ammunition the vast distance from the Nieman river into Russia . The army left Prussia with over 1100 artillery pieces of various kinds and sizes . Despite heavy rain , the French arrived in Vilnius ; despite the mud , the artillery was established prior to the battle and contributed with successful targeted fire . On the evening before the Battle of Borodino , Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re scouted the Russian positions to determine the means of bombarding the redoubts that the Russians had established on their left . During the night , he strategically placed the French artillery park ; at daybreak , the artillery bombarded the Russian positions , firing over 70,000 rounds . One of Lariboisi\u00e8re 's sons ( Ferdinand ) , was fatally wounded in a charge on the Russian lines at Borodino . Grief-stricken and exhausted with fatigue , the general fell sick in Vilnius and died in K\u00f6nigsberg on 21 December 1812 . = = Legacy = = His body rests in the church of les Invalides , and on his coffin is the following inscription : Ambroise Baston , Count of La Riboisi\u00e8re , major general , commanding the artillery of the Grande Arm\u00e9e , Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor , born in Foug\u00e8res , died at K\u00f6nigsberg , December 21 , 1812 . The General 's heart is hosted in a private chapel near his castle of Monthorin at Louvign\u00e9-du-D\u00e9sert , in Brittany . Honor\u00e9-Charles Baston de Lariboisi\u00e8re , another of his sons , also served in the artillery . He survived not only the Battle of Borodino in which his brother ( Ferdinand ) was killed , but also the retreat from Moscow and the subsequent campaigns in Prussia and Saxony . He served in the Chamber of Deputies and was raised to the peerage of France . He founded the H\u00f4pital Lariboisi\u00e8re .",

                    "text": "Battle of the Raz de Sein = The Battle of the Raz de Sein was a naval engagement of the blockade of Brest during the French Revolutionary Wars between a French and Royal Navy ships of the line on 21 April 1798 . The British blockade fleet under Admiral Lord Bridport had sailed from St Helens on 12 April and on the morning of 21 April was crossing the Iroise Passage when sails were spotted to the east . Three ships were detached in pursuit , led by the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Mars under Captain Alexander Hood . As the British ships approached their quarry a third sail was sighted to the southeast close to the coastline and moving north towards Brest . This ship was the 74-gun Hercule under Captain Louis L 'H\u00e9ritier , newly commissioned at Lorient and sailing to Brest to join the main French fleet and the British squadron immediately changed direction to intercept the new target . Facing overwhelming odds L 'H\u00e9ritier attempted to escape through the narrow Raz de Sein passage , but found the tide against him and so anchored at the mouth of the passage to await the British attack . At 21 : 15 Mars reached Hercule , coming under heavy fire as Hood manoeuvred into position , bringing his ship crashing alongside the French vessel . For more than an hour the ships fired directly into one another , so close that their guns could not be run out but had to be fired from inside the ships . Damage and casualties were severe on both sides , the latter including Hood who was mortally wounded at the height of the engagement . Ultimately Hercule was forced to surrender after attempts to board Mars failed . Both ships were battered and burnt , with the French suffering at least 290 casualties and the British 90 . Hercule was conveyed to Britain in the aftermath and later repaired and served in the Royal Navy until 1810 . Both L 'H\u00e9ritier and the deceased Hood were highly praised for their conduct during the battle , which is noted as being a very rare example during this period of an action between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence . = = Background = = During the French Revolutionary Wars the Royal Navy had exerted dominance at sea over its continental rivals , most immediately the French Navy with its principal fleet based at Brest on the Breton coast of the Bay of Biscay . To contain this fleet the British practiced a close blockade strategy ; maintaining a fleet off Brest whenever weather conditions permitted to prevent the French fleet from breaking out into the Atlantic Ocean . This blockade force also limited French trade and maritime communications , attacking merchant ships and individual warships seeking to resupply or reinforce the main French fleet . This made French maritime journeys extremely hazardous even in inshore waters : in June 1795 the main French fleet had suffered a defeat at the hands of the blockade force at the Battle of Groix in the approaches to the port of Lorient , while at the Action of 13 January 1797 the independently sailing 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l 'Homme was driven ashore and destroyed in the approaches to Brest by two frigates of the blockade squadron . On 12 April 1798 the British blockade fleet under the command of Admiral Lord Bridport sailed from its winter anchorage at St Helens on the Isle of Wight for the Breton coast . Bridport mustered ten ships of the line to maintain the watch on Brest , although detachments of the fleet had been cruising in the region since 25 January and with notice he could call on 28 ships of the line . The French fleet had suffered a series of setbacks in the early years of the war : in addition to the losses at Groix , seven ships had been lost at the Glorious First of June in 1795 and more were wrecked during the failed Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver operation of 1795 and the Exp\u00e9dition d 'Irlande in 1796 . To replenish these losses , the French Navy was building new ships at its major fleet bases and in April 1798 a ship had been commissioned at Lorient : the Hercule , a 74-gun ship of 1,876 tons burthen launched in July 1797 and commanded by the experienced Captain Louis L 'H\u00e9ritier , veteran of the Glorious First of June , and with a crew of 680 , 20 short of a full complement . = = Pursuit = = On 20 April L 'H\u00e9ritier was ordered to take Hercule on her maiden voyage , the short journey northwest along the coast to join the main fleet under Vice-Admiral Morard de Galles at Brest , where the crew would be augmented to reach the full complement . On board were surplus naval supplies , including a full set of rigging for a ship of the line , from the destroyed ship Quatorze Juillet which had caught fire at Lorient earlier in the month . L 'H\u00e9ritier 's crew were inexperienced and the captain did not intend to seek action , remaining close to the coastline during the first day of the journey . As his ship crossed Audierne Bay between Point Penmarc 'h and the Pointe du Raz however sails were sighted to the northwest . These sails belonged to three ships of Bridport 's fleet . At 11 : 00 on 21 April the British fleet had been cruising in the Iroise Passage when two sails were sighted approximately 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ) to the east . Bridport ordered his three most easterly ships to detach and investigate the sails : the 74-gun ships of the line HMS Mars under Captain Alexander Hood , HMS Ramillies under Captain Henry Inman and the 38-gun frigate HMS Jason under Captain Charles Stirling . The strong winds favoured the large ships of the line as they pursued the strange sails , which were identified as French , until at 14 : 00 they were pulling abreast of them when a third sail was sighted about 15 nautical miles ( 28 km ) to the southeast , sailing close to the shore . This new sail was much larger than the others sighted earlier in the day , and the detached squadron abandoned their former pursuit and turned towards the new arrival , Hercule . By 17 : 45 , L 'H\u00e9ritier was in full flight with the British force strung out behind him , the rest of Bridport 's fleet far to the west . Jason had the lead with Mars shortly behind , although Inman on Ramillies had lost his fore topmast and had dropped back . Hood , an experienced officer and a nephew of both Bridport and the veteran Admiral Lord Hood , pressed his ship forwards and gradually gained on both Jason and Hercule . L 'H\u00e9ritier knew that in open water he would be caught and overwhelmed , and sought instead to escape through the narrow and dangerous channel of the Raz de Sein , a rocky passage between the \u00cele de Sein and the Pointe du Raz : during the Exp\u00e9dition d 'Irlande the French ship of the line S\u00e9duisant had been wrecked in the Raz de Sein with 680 lives . As Hercule approached the channel , Hood put Mars on the starboard tack , overtaking Jason and bearing down on the French ship . At 20 : 30 , L 'H\u00e9ritier recognised that the current was too strong for Hercule to successfully navigate the Raz de Sein and instead anchored at the mouth of the channel with a spring on his cable , a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed L 'H\u00e9ritier to swing his broadside to face the enemy while stationary , roughly 2 nautical miles ( 3.7 km ) southwest of Pointe de Raz and about 21 nautical miles ( 39 km ) from his destination at Brest . = = Battle = = At 20 : 45 , with Jason far behind in the darkness , Mars hauled up and Hood attempted to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule . The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside . At 21 : 15 Mars was in range and L 'H\u00e9ritier opened fire , Hood replying immediately . For ten minutes , the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire , with damage to the bowsprit and foremast , as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21 : 25 and dropping anchor . The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship , the force of the collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars . Thus locked together , both captains ordered their ships to pour fire into the other . So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships could not be run out , and instead had to be fired from inside the ships . The heat from this sustained bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship : during the combat the ragged holes torn in the side of Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away , leaving wide scars along the ship 's sides . Casualties were heavy on both sides : 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh , severing his femoral artery . Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely , Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield . The French casualties were significantly higher than the British , a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood 's well-trained crew . Aware that his ship was suffering the worst of the casualties , L 'H\u00e9ritier ordered his men to attempt to board the British ship of the line , but first one and then another attempt to do so was driven back with heavy casualties . The lighting of Hercule had gone out at the beginning of the engagement , leaving her crew confused , and as a result , only around 40 men answered when L 'H\u00e9ritier ordered the boarding ; he was himself injured twice , to the head by a sabre and to the thigh by a pike , while leading the assault . At 10 : 30 , after an hour of continual bombardment L 'H\u00e9ritier surrendered : Hercule 's hull had been torn open , five guns were dismounted with others damaged and more than two fifths of the crew killed or wounded . Jason was approaching fast and the rest of Bridport 's fleet was close enough to see the muzzle flashes from the battle . = = Aftermath = = L 'H\u00e9ritier submitted his sword to Butterfield in surrender and it was presented to the dying Hood , who accepted it before expiring . At 22 : 50 Jason arrived and Stirling took charge of removing prisoners from Hercule and began the long process of extricating the two battered ships of the line from the dangerous Raz de Sein channel . Losses on the French ship were not accurately recorded in the aftermath of the action , but some accounts suggested they were as high as 400 although a more realistic estimate of 290 casualties was made by the surviving French officers . British losses amounted to three officers and 19 men killed , eight men missing ( believed to have drowned after falling overboard resisting L 'H\u00e9ritier 's boarding attempts ) and another 60 wounded . The weather was fortunately calm , as neither Mars nor Hercule were in a condition to survive a storm , and with great care Hercule was brought into Plymouth on 27 April and repairs were begun with the intention of restoring the ship to active service condition . The cost of these repairs totaled \u00a3 12,500 ( the equivalent of \u00a3 1,186,700 as of 2016 ) , but HMS Hercule was ultimately commissioned into the Royal Navy and served until 1810 . Historian Robert Gardiner has noted that this \" classic fight \" was unusual in being fought between two single ships of the line of equal force and size without an external influence , and Edward Pelham Brenton wrote in 1823 that \" The meeting of two ships of the line is a circumstance of rare occurrence , and its decision in our favour a brilliant ornament to our naval history \" : he could only identify three other such incidents in British naval history . Examination of the relative size and strength of the combatants shows that they were well-matched : the respective broadside weights were 984 lbs on Mars to 985 lbs on Hercule ; Hercules at 1,876 tons burthen measured only 34 tons more than Mars , and Hercule 's understrength crew of 680 was still 46 more than on board Mars and the British crew had also been active during the Spithead Mutiny in 1797 , during which Hood had been temporarily deposed as captain . Both were relatively new ships , Hercule only 24 hours at sea while Mars was the nameship of the 1794 Mars class built at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars . In summary , historian William James indicates that the greater experience of Hood 's crew and the nearby presence of other British ships gave Mars a slight advantage , but that \" the action of the Mars and Hercule was one that , in the conduct of it throughout , reflected about an equal share of credit upon both the contending parties . \" Although some British histories reported that L 'H\u00e9ritier died of his wounds in the aftermath of the action , this was not the case ; on his return to France following exchange , L 'H\u00e9ritier faced a court martial for the loss of his ship and was honorably acquitted and received a letter of praising his resistance from Minister of Marine Rear-Admiral \u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix . In Britain , Butterfield was promoted to commander , and Hood was posthumously commended , Bridport writing in his official dispatch that \" No Praise of mine can add one Ray of Brilliancy to the distinguished Valour of Captain Alexander Hood \" . His body was returned to England and buried near his home in Butleigh , Somerset under a monument provided by his family .",

Lee , who called him his \" Old War Horse . \" He served under Lee as a corps commander for many of the famous battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater , but also with Gen. Braxton Bragg in the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater . Biographer and historian Jeffry D. Wert wrote that \" Longstreet ... was the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia ; in fact , he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side . \" Longstreet 's talents as a general made significant contributions to the Confederate victories at Second Bull Run ( Second Manassas ) , Fredericksburg , and Chickamauga , in both offensive and defensive roles . He also performed strongly during the Seven Days Battles , the Battle of Antietam , and until he was seriously wounded , at the Battle of the Wilderness . His performance in semiautonomous command during the Knoxville Campaign resulted in a Confederate defeat . His most controversial service was at the Battle of Gettysburg , where he openly disagreed with General Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised the disastrous infantry assault known as Pickett 's Charge . He enjoyed a successful post-war career working for the U.S. government as a diplomat , civil servant , and administrator . However , his conversion to the Republican Party and his cooperation with his old friend , President Ulysses S. Grant , as well as critical comments he wrote in his memoirs about General Lee 's wartime performance , made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues . His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874 . Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet 's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy 's loss of the war . His reputation in the South was damaged for over a century and has only recently begun a slow reassessment . = = Early life and career = = James Longstreet was born on January 8 , 1821 in Edgefield District , South Carolina , an area that is now part of North Augusta , Edgefield County . He was the fifth child and third son of James Longstreet ( 1783-1833 ) , of Dutch descent , and Mary Ann Dent ( 1793-1855 ) of English descent , originally from New Jersey and Maryland respectively , who owned a cotton plantation close to where the village of Gainesville would be founded in northeastern Georgia . James 's ancestor Dirck Stoffels Langestraet immigrated to the Dutch colony of New Netherland in 1657 , but the name became Anglicized over the generations . James 's father was impressed by his son 's \" rocklike \" character on the rural plantation , giving him the nickname Peter , and he was known as Pete or Old Pete for the rest of his life . Longstreet 's father decided on a military career for his son , but felt that the local education available to him would not be adequate preparation . At the age of nine , James was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in Augusta , Georgia . His uncle , Augustus Baldwin Longstreet , was a newspaper editor , educator , and a Methodist minister . James spent eight years on his uncle 's plantation , Westover , just outside the city while he attended the Academy of Richmond County . His father died from a cholera epidemic while visiting Augusta in 1833 ; although James 's mother and the rest of the family moved to Somerville , Alabama , following his father 's death , James remained with uncle Augustus . In 1837 , Augustus attempted to obtain an appointment for James to the United States Military Academy , but the vacancy for his congressional district had already been filled so James was appointed in 1838 by a relative , Reuben Chapman , who represented the First District of Alabama ( where Mary Longstreet lived ) . James was a poor student academically and a disciplinary problem at West Point , ranking 54th out of 56 cadets when he graduated in 1842 . He was popular with his classmates , however , and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during the Civil War , including George Henry Thomas , William S. Rosecrans ( his West Point roommate ) , John Pope , D.H. Hill , Lafayette McLaws , George Pickett , and Ulysses S. Grant of the class of 1843 . Longstreet was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Infantry . Longstreet spent his first two years of service at Jefferson Barracks , Missouri , where he was soon joined by his friend , Lieutenant Ulysses Grant . Soon after , Longstreet met his future first wife Maria Louisa Garland , called Louise by her family . She was the daughter of Longstreet 's regimental commander , Lt. Col. John Garland . They married in March 1848 , after the Mexican-American War . Although their marriage would last for over 40 years and produce 10 children , Longstreet never mentioned Louise in his memoirs and most anecdotes about their relationship came to historians through the writings of his second wife , Helen Dortch Longstreet . At about the same time as Longstreet began courting Garland , Grant became acquainted with and courted Longstreet 's fourth cousin , Julia Dent , and the couple eventually married . Historians agree that Longstreet attended the Grant wedding on August 22 , 1848 in St. Louis , but his role at the ceremony remains unclear . Grant biographer Jean Edward Smith asserted that Longstreet served as Grant 's best man at the wedding . John Y. Simon , editor of Julia Grant 's memoirs , concluded that Longstreet \" may have been a groomsman , \" and Longstreet biographer Donald Brigman Sanger called the role of best man \" uncertain \" while noting that neither Grant nor Longstreet mentioned any such role in either of their memoirs . = = Mexican-American War = = Longstreet served with distinction in the Mexican-American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry . Early in the war , he served as a lieutenant in Zachary Taylor 's army at the 1846 Battle of Monterrey . He received brevet promotions to captain for Contreras and Churubusco and to major for Molino del Rey . In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12 , 1847 , he was wounded in the thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors ; falling , he handed the flag to his friend , Lt. George E. Pickett , who was able to reach the summit . Longstreet was a veteran member of the Aztec Club of 1847 . The Aztec Club was a military society for officers who had served in the Mexican War . Many distinguished officers , both Union and Confederate , who served the American Civil War were members of the Aztec Club . After the war and his recovery from the Chapultepec wound , Longstreet and his new wife served on frontier duty in Texas , primarily at Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg and Fort Bliss in El Paso . He performed scouting missions and also served as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry from July 1858 . Author Kevin Phillips claims that during this period Longstreet was involved in a plot to draw the Mexican state of Chihuahua into the Union as a slave state . Longstreet was not enthusiastic about secession from the Union , but he had learned from his uncle Augustus about the doctrine of states ' rights early in his life and had seen his uncle 's passion for it . Although he was born in South Carolina and reared in Georgia , he offered his services to the state of Alabama , which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived . Furthermore , he was the senior West Point graduate from that state , which implied a commensurate rank in the state 's forces would be available . He resigned from the U.S. Army in June 1861 to cast his lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War . = = American Civil War = = = = = First Bull Run and the Peninsula = = = Longstreet arrived in Richmond , Virginia with a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army . He met with Confederate President Jefferson Davis at the executive mansion on June 22 , 1861 , where he was informed that he had been appointed a brigadier general with date of rank on June 17 , a commission he accepted on June 25 . He was ordered to report to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas , where he was given command of a brigade of three Virginia regiments \u2014 the 1st , 11th , and 17th Virginia Infantry regiments . Longstreet assembled his staff and trained his brigade incessantly . They saw their first action at Blackburn 's Ford on July 18 , resisting a Union Army reconnaissance in force that preceded the First Battle of Bull Run ( First Manassas ) . When the main attack came at the opposite end of the line on July 21 , the brigade played a relatively minor role , although it endured artillery fire for nine hours . Longstreet was infuriated that his commanders would not allow a vigorous pursuit of the defeated Union Army . His trusted staff officer , Moxley Sorrel , recorded that he was \" in a fine rage . He dashed his hat furiously to the ground , stamped , and bitter words escaped him . \" He quoted Longstreet as saying , \" Retreat ! Hell , the Federal army has broken to pieces . \" On October 7 , Longstreet was promoted to major general and assumed command of a division in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia \u2014 four infantry brigades and Hampton 's Legion . Tragedy struck the Longstreet family in January 1862 . A scarlet fever epidemic in Richmond claimed the lives of his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne , his four-year-old son James , and eleven-year-old Augustus ( \" Gus \" ) , all within a week . His 13-year-old son Garland almost succumbed . The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn , both personally and socially . In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties , drinking , and poker games . After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became more somber , he rarely drank , and he became a devout Episcopalian . Longstreet turned in a mixed performance in the Peninsula Campaign that spring . He executed well as a rear guard commander at Yorktown and Williamsburg , delaying the advance of Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan 's army toward Richmond . During the Battle of Seven Pines he marched his men in the wrong direction down the wrong road , causing congestion and confusion with other Confederate units , diluting the effect of the massive Confederate counterattack against McClellan . His report unfairly blamed fellow Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger for the mishaps . Gen. Joseph E. Johnston was wounded during the battle and he was replaced in command of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee . During the Seven Days Battles that followed in late June , Longstreet had operational command of nearly half of Lee 's army \u2014 15 brigades \u2014 as it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula . Longstreet performed aggressively and well in his new , larger command , particularly at Gaines ' Mill and Glendale . Lee 's army in general suffered from weak performances by Longstreet 's peers , including , uncharacteristically , Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \" Stonewall \" Jackson , and was unable to destroy the Union Army . Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet 's confidence and calmness in battle : \" He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle the world seemed flying to pieces . \" Gen. Lee said , \" Longstreet was the staff in my right hand . \" He had been established as Lee 's principal lieutenant . = = = Second Bull Run , Maryland , and Fredericksburg = = = The military reputations of Lee 's corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious , offensive component of Lee 's army , whereas Longstreet more typically advocated and executed defensive strategies and tactics . Jackson has been described as the army 's hammer , Longstreet its anvil . In the Northern Virginia Campaign of August 1862 , this stereotype did not hold true . Longstreet commanded the Right Wing ( later to become known as the First Corps ) and Jackson commanded the Left Wing . Jackson started the campaign under Lee 's orders with a sweeping flanking maneuver that placed his corps into the rear of Union Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia , but he then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him . On August 28 and August 29 , the start of the Second Battle of Bull Run ( Second Manassas ) , Pope pounded Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched north to reach the battlefield . Postwar criticism of Longstreet claimed that he marched his men too slowly , leaving Jackson to bear the brunt of the fighting for two days , but they covered roughly 30 miles ( 50 km ) in a little over 24 hours and Gen. Lee did not attempt to get his army concentrated any faster . When Longstreet 's men arrived around midday on August 29 , Lee planned a flanking attack on the Union Army , which was concentrating its attention on Jackson . Longstreet demurred against three suggestions from Lee , urging him to attack , recommending instead that a reconnaissance in force be conducted to survey the ground in front of him . By 6 : 30 p.m. the division of Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood moved forward against the troops of the Union V Corps , and Longstreet withdrew them at 8 : 30 p.m. , having a better idea of the terrain and enemy soldiers in the area . On the next day , Longstreet 's preparations paid dividends , as his artillery was a major factor in helping Jackson resist the V Corps attack , and he capitalized on Federal confusion by launching an attack of his own , anticipating an order from Lee that had not yet arrived . Despite the smashing victory that followed , Longstreet 's performance at the battle was criticized by postbellum advocates of the Lost Cause , claiming that his slowness , reluctance to attack , and disobedience to Gen. Lee were a harbinger of his controversial performance to come on July 2 , 1863 , at the Battle of Gettysburg . Lee 's biographer , Douglas Southall Freeman , wrote : \" The seeds of much of the disaster at Gettysburg were sown in that instant \u2014 when Lee yielded to Longstreet and Longstreet discovered that he would . \" Despite this criticism , the following day , August 30 , was one of Longstreet 's finest performances of the war . Pope came to believe that Jackson was starting to retreat and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union army 's left flank with over 25,000 men . For over four hours they \" pounded like a giant hammer \" with Longstreet actively directing artillery fire and sending brigades into the fray . Longstreet and Lee were together during the assault and both of them came under Union artillery fire . Although the Union troops put up a furious defense , Pope 's army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run ( First Manassas ) , fought on roughly the same battleground . Longstreet gave all of the credit for the victory to Lee , describing the campaign as \" clever and brilliant . \" It established a strategic model he believed to be ideal \u2014 the use of defensive tactics within a strategic offensive . Longstreet 's actions in the final two major Confederate defensive battles of 1862 would be the proving grounds for his development of dominant defensive tactics . In the Maryland Campaign of September , at the Battle of Antietam , Longstreet held his part of the Confederate defensive line against Union forces twice as numerous . After the delaying action Longstreet 's corps fought at South Mountain , he retired to Sharpsburg to join Stonewall Jackson , and prepared to fight a defensive battle . Using terrain to his advantage , Longstreet validated his idea that the tactical defense was now vastly superior to the exposed offense . While the offense dominated in the time of Napoleon , the technological advancements had overturned this . Lt. Col. Harold M. Knudsen claims that Longstreet was one of the few Civil War officers truly aware of this . At the end of that bloodiest day of the Civil War , Lee greeted his subordinate by saying , \" Ah ! Here is Longstreet ; here 's my old war-horse ! \" On October 9 , a few weeks after Antietam , Longstreet was promoted to lieutenant general . Lee arranged for Longstreet 's promotion to be dated one day earlier than Jackson 's , making the Old War-Horse the senior lieutenant general in the entire Confederate Army . In an army reorganization in November , Longstreet 's command , now designated the First Corps , consisted of five divisions , approximately 41,000 men . In December , Longstreet 's First Corps played the decisive role in the Battle of Fredericksburg . Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early , it allowed Longstreet to take the time to dig in portions of his line , methodically site artillery , and set up a kill zone over the axis of advance he thought the Union attack would come . Remembering the slaughter at Antietam , in which the Confederates did not construct defensive works , Longstreet ordered trenches , abatis , and fieldworks to be constructed , which would set a precedent for future defensive battles of the Army of Northern Virginia . Additionally , Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone wall at the foot of Marye 's Heights and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces . The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye 's Heights , Longstreet only 1,000 . His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain ; this time it was the combination of terrain , defensive works , and a centralized coordination of artillery . = = = Suffolk = = = In the early spring of 1863 , Longstreet suggested to Lee that his corps be detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to reinforce the Army of Tennessee , where Gen. Braxton Bragg was being challenged in Middle Tennessee by Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans , Longstreet 's roommate at West Point . It is possible that Longstreet believed that an independent command in the West offered better opportunities for advancement than a corps under Lee 's shadow . Lee did detach two divisions from the First Corps , but ordered them to Richmond , not Tennessee . Seaborne movements of the Union IX Corps potentially threatened vital ports on the mid-Atlantic coast . The division of George Pickett started for the capital in mid-February , was followed by John Hood 's , and then Longstreet himself was told to take command of the detached divisions and the Departments of North Carolina and Southern Virginia . In April , Longstreet besieged Union forces in the city of Suffolk , Virginia , a minor operation , but one that was very important to Lee 's army , still stationed in war-devastated central Virginia . It enabled Confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of provisions that had been under Union control . However , this operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from the Battle of Chancellorsville in May . Despite Lee 's brilliant victory at Chancellorsville , Longstreet once again came under criticism , claiming that he could have marched his men back from Suffolk in time to join Lee . However , from the Chancellorsville and Suffolk scenario , Longstreet brought forward the beginnings of a new Confederate strategy . These events proved that the Army of Northern Virginia could manage with fewer troops for periods of time , and units could be shifted to create windows of opportunity in other theaters . Longstreet advocated the first strategic movements to utilize rail , interior lines , and create temporary numerical advantages in Mississippi or Tennessee prior to Gettysburg . = = = Gettysburg = = = = = = = Campaign plans = = = = Following Chancellorsville and the death of Stonewall Jackson , Longstreet and Lee met in mid-May to discuss options for the army 's summer campaign . Longstreet advocated , once again , detachment of all or part of his corps to be sent to Tennessee . The justification for this course of action was becoming more urgent as Union Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was advancing on the critical Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River , Vicksburg . Longstreet argued that a reinforced army under Bragg could defeat Rosecrans and drive toward the Ohio River , which would compel Grant to break his hold on Vicksburg . Lee was opposed to a division of his army and instead advocated a large-scale offensive or raid into Pennsylvania . In his memoirs , Longstreet described his reaction to Lee 's proposal : His plan or wishes announced , it became useless and improper to offer suggestions leading to a different course . All that I could ask was that the policy of the campaign should be one of defensive tactics ; that we should work so as to force the enemy to attack us , in such good position as we might find in our own country , so well adapted to that purpose \u2014 which might assure us of a grand triumph . To this he readily assented as an important and material adjunct to his general plan . This was written years after the campaign and is affected by hindsight , both of the results of the battle and of the postbellum criticism of the Lost Cause authors . In letters of the time Longstreet made no reference to such a bargain with Lee . In April 1868 , Lee said that he \" had never made any such promise , and had never thought of doing any such thing . \" Yet in his post-battle report , Lee wrote , \" It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance from our base , unless attacked by the enemy . \" The Army of Northern Virginia was reorganized after Jackson 's death . Two division commanders , Richard S. Ewell and A.P. Hill , were promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of the Second and the newly created Third Corps respectively . Longstreet 's First Corps gave up the division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson during the reorganization , leaving him with the divisions of Lafayette McLaws , George Pickett , and John Hood . In the initial movements of the campaign , Longstreet 's corps followed Ewell 's through the Shenandoah Valley . A spy he had hired , Henry Thomas Harrison who went by just \" Harrison \" , was instrumental in warning the Confederates that the Union Army of the Potomac was advancing north to meet them more quickly than they had anticipated , prompting Lee to order the immediate concentration of his army near Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . = = = = Battle of Gettysburg = = = = Longstreet 's actions at the Battle of Gettysburg would be the centerpiece of the controversy that surrounded him for over a century . Ahead of his troops he arrived on the battlefield late in the afternoon of the first day , July 1 , 1863 . By then , two Union corps had been driven by Ewell and Hill back through the town into defensive positions on Cemetery Hill . Lee had not intended to fight before his army was fully concentrated , but chance and questionable decisions by A.P. Hill brought on the battle , which- on the first day- was an impressive Confederate victory . Meeting with Lee , Longstreet was concerned about the strength of the Union defensive position and advocated a strategic movement around the left flank of the enemy , to \" secure good ground between him and his capital , \" which would presumably compel the Union commander , Maj. Gen. George G. Meade , to attack defensive positions erected by the Confederates . Instead , Lee exclaimed , \" If the enemy is there tomorrow , we must attack him . \" Lee 's plan for July 2 called for Longstreet to attack the Union 's left flank , which would be followed up by Hill 's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center , while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right . Longstreet was not ready to attack as early as Lee envisioned . He received permission from Lee to wait for Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law 's brigade ( Hood 's division ) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades ; Law marched his men quickly , but did not arrive until noon . Three of Longstreet 's brigades were still in march column , and some distance from the attack positions they would need to reach . All of Longstreet 's divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position , misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route . Postbellum criticism of Longstreet claims that he was ordered by Lee to attack in the early morning and that his delays were a significant contributor to the loss of the battle . However , Lee agreed to the delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for the attack until 11 a.m. Although Longstreet 's motivations have long been clouded by the vitriol of the Lost Cause partisans ( see Legacy ) , many historians agree that Longstreet did not aggressively pursue Lee 's orders to launch an attack as early as possible . Biographer Jeffry D. Wert wrote , \" Longstreet deserves censure for his performance on the morning of July 2 . He allowed his disagreement with Lee 's decision to affect his conduct . Once the commanding general determined to assail the enemy , duty required Longstreet to comply with the vigor and thoroughness that had previously characterized his generalship . The concern for detail , the regard for timely information , and the need for preparation were absent . \" Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote , \" Unenthusiastic about the attack , Longstreet consumed so much time in properly assembling and aligning the corps that the assault did not commence until 4 p.m. During all the time that passed , Meade continued to move in troops to bring about a more and more complete concentration ; by 6 p.m. he had achieved numerical superiority and had his left well covered . \" Campaign historian Edwin Coddington presents a lengthy description of the approach march , which he described as \" a comedy of errors such as one might expect of inexperienced commanders and raw militia , but not of Lee 's \" War Horse \" and his veteran troops . \" He called the episode \" a dark moment in Longstreet 's career as a general . \" Gettysburg historian Harry Pfanz concluded that \" Longstreet 's angry dissidence had resulted in further wasted time and delay . \" David L. Callihan , in a 2002 reassessment of Longstreet 's legacy , wrote , \" It is appalling that a field commander of Longstreet 's experience and caliber would so cavalierly and ineptly march and prepare his men for battle . \" An alternative view has been expressed by John Lott , \" General Longstreet did all that could be expected on the 2nd day and any allegations of failing to exercise his duty by ordering a morning assault can be repudiated . It would have been impossible to have commenced an attack much earlier than it occurred , and it is doubtful that the Confederacy could have placed the attack in any more secure hands than General Longstreet . \" But Longstreet 's command of the operation had for the most part , been reasonable , since taking the route he should have would have alerted the whole Union army of his assault . Regardless of the controversy regarding the preparations , however , once the assault began around 4 p.m. , Longstreet pressed the assault by McLaws and Hood ( Pickett 's division had not yet arrived ) competently against fierce Union resistance , but it was largely unsuccessful , with significant casualties . On the night of July 2 , Longstreet did not follow his usual custom of meeting Gen. Lee at his headquarters to discuss the day 's battle , claiming that he was too fatigued to make the ride . Instead , he spent part of the night planning for a movement around Big Round Top that would allow him to attack the enemy 's flank and rear . ( Longstreet , despite his use of scouting parties , was apparently unaware that a considerable body of troops from the Union VI Corps was in position to block this move . ) Shortly after issuing orders for the attack , around sunrise , Longstreet was joined at his headquarters by Lee , who was dismayed at this turn of events . The commanding general had intended for Longstreet to attack the Union left early in the morning in a manner similar to the attack of July 2 , using Pickett 's newly arrived division , in concert with a resumed attack by Ewell on Culp 's Hill . What Lee found was that no one had ordered Pickett 's division forward from its bivouac in the rear and that Longstreet had been planning an independent operation without consulting with him . Lee wrote with some restraint in his after-battle report that Longstreet 's \" dispositions were not completed as early as was expected . \" Since his plans for an early-morning coordinated attack were now infeasible , Lee instead ordered Longstreet to coordinate a massive assault on the center of the Union line , employing the division of George Pickett and brigades from A.P. Hill 's corps . Longstreet knew this assault had little chance of success . The Union Army was in a position reminiscent of the one Longstreet had taken at Fredericksburg to defeat Burnside 's assault . The Confederates would have to cover almost a mile of open ground and spend time negotiating sturdy fences under fire . The lessons of Fredericksburg and Malvern Hill were lost to Lee on this day . In his memoirs , Longstreet claims to have told Lee that he believed the attack on the Union center would fail : General , I have been a soldier all my life . I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples , by squads , companies , regiments , divisions , and armies , and should know , as well as any one , what soldiers can do . It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arranged for battle can take that position . During the artillery barrage that preceded the infantry assault , Longstreet began to agonize over an assault that was going to cost dearly . He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett 's division to his artillery chief , Col. Edward Porter Alexander . When the time came to actually order Pickett forward , Longstreet could only nod in assent , unable to verbalize the order . The assault , known as Pickett 's Charge , suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated . It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day . Criticism of Longstreet after the war was based not only on his reputed conduct at the Battle of Gettysburg , but also intemperate remarks he made about Robert E. Lee and his strategies , such as : That he [ Lee ] was excited and off his balance was evident on the afternoon of the 1st , and he labored under that oppression until enough blood was shed to appease him . For years after the war Longstreet 's reputation suffered and was blamed for the failed attack even though Lee ordered the advance after Longstreet 's repeated advice to cancel the attack . = = = Tennessee = = = In mid-August 1863 , Longstreet resumed his attempts to be transferred to the Western Theater . He wrote a private letter to Secretary of War James Seddon , requesting that he be transferred to serve under his old friend Gen. Joseph E. Johnston . He followed this up in conversations with his congressional ally , Senator Louis Wigfall , who had long considered Longstreet a suitable replacement for Braxton Bragg . Since Bragg 's army was under increasing pressure from Rosecrans outside of Chattanooga , Lee and President Davis agreed to the request on September 5 . In one of the most daunting logistical efforts of the Confederacy , Longstreet , with the divisions of Lafayette McLaws and John Hood , a brigade from George Pickett 's division , and Porter Alexander 's 26-gun artillery battalion , traveled over 16 railroads on a 775-mile ( 1,247 km ) route through the Carolinas to reach Bragg in northern Georgia . Although the entire operation would take over three weeks , Longstreet and lead elements of his corps arrived on September 17 . The First Corps veterans arrived in the early stages of the Battle of Chickamauga . Bragg had already begun an unsuccessful attempt to interpose his army between Rosecrans and Chattanooga before the arrival of Longstreet 's corps . When the two met at Bragg 's headquarters in the evening , Bragg placed Longstreet in command of the Left Wing of his army ; Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk commanded the Right . On September 20 , 1863 , Longstreet lined up eight brigades in a deep column against a narrow front , an attack very similar to future German tank tactics in World War II . By chance , a mistaken order from General Rosecrans caused a gap to appear in the Union line and Longstreet took additional advantage of it to increase his chances of success . The organization of the attack was well suited to the terrain and would have penetrated the Union line regardless . The Union right collapsed and Rosecrans fled the field , as units began to retreat in panic . Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas managed to rally the retreating units and solidify a defensive position on Snodgrass Hill . He held that position against repeated afternoon attacks by Longstreet , who was not adequately supported by the Confederate right wing . Once night fell , the battle was over , and Thomas was able to extricate the units under his control to Chattanooga . Bragg 's failure to coordinate the right wing and cavalry to further envelop Thomas prevented a total rout of the Union Army . Bragg also neglected to pursue the retreating Federals aggressively , resulting in the futile siege of Chattanooga . Nevertheless , Chickamauga was the greatest Confederate victory in the Western Theater and Longstreet deserved a good portion of the credit . Longstreet soon clashed with Bragg and became leader of the group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed . Bragg 's subordinates had long been dissatisfied with his leadership and abrasive personality ; the arrival of Longstreet ( the senior lieutenant general in the Army ) and his officers , added credibility to the earlier claims , and was a catalyst toward action . Longstreet wrote to Seddon , \" I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as long as we have our present commander . \" The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person . What followed was one of the most bizarre scenes of the war , with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him . Longstreet stated that Bragg \" was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight \" and that he \" knew nothing of the business . \" Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict . Bragg retained his position , relieving or reassigning the generals who had testified against him , and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units that he brought with him from Virginia . Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg , and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg 's removal , Longstreet did the best he could to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign . While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga , Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant . He knew this Union reaction was underway , and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport , Alabama , where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive . After sending his artillery commander , Porter Alexander , to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town , he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege , setting up logistical support in Rome , Georgia , to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead , possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position . The plan was well received and approved by President Davis , but it was disapproved by Bragg , who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed . Longstreet accepted Bragg 's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside . Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg 's part , but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet 's men to return to Lee 's army and this movement was in that direction . Longstreet was criticized for the slow pace of his advance toward Knoxville in November and some of his troops began using the nickname \" Peter the Slow \" to describe him . Burnside evaded him at the Battle of Campbell 's Station and settled into entrenchments around the city , which Longstreet besieged unsuccessfully . The Battle of Fort Sanders failed to bring a Confederate breakthrough . When Bragg was defeated by Grant at Chattanooga on November 25 , Longstreet was ordered to join forces with the Army of Tennessee in northern Georgia . He demurred and began to move back to Virginia , soon pursued by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in early December . The armies went into winter quarters and the First Corps rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia in the spring . The only real effect of the minor campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he sorely needed in Chattanooga . Longstreet 's second independent command ( after Suffolk ) was a failure and his self-confidence was damaged . He reacted to the failure of the campaign by blaming others , as he had done at Seven Pines . He relieved Lafayette McLaws from command and requested the court martial of Brig. Gens . Jerome B. Robertson and Evander M. Law . He also submitted a letter of resignation to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on December 30 , 1863 , but his request to be relieved was denied . His corps suffered through a severe winter in Eastern Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions . Writing to Georgia 's Quartermaster General , Ira Roe Foster on January 24 , 1864 , Longstreet noted : \" There are five Georgia Brigades in this Army \u2013 Wofford 's , G.T. Anderson 's , Bryan 's , Benning 's , and Crews ' cavalry brigade . They are all alike in excessive need of shoes , clothing of all kinds , and blankets . All that you can send will be thankfully received . \" Meanwhile , Longstreet again developed strategic plans . He called for an offensive through Tennessee into Kentucky in which his command would be bolstered by P.G.T. Beauregard and 20,000 men . Although he had the concurrence of Gen. Lee , Longstreet was unable to convince President Davis or his newly appointed military advisor , Braxton Bragg . = = = Wilderness to Appomattox = = = Finding out that his old friend Ulysses Grant was in command of the Union Army , he told his fellow officers that \" he will fight us every day and every hour until the end of the war . \" Longstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee 's army , the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864 , in which he launched a powerful flanking attack along the Orange Plank Road against the Union II Corps and nearly drove it from the field . Once again he developed innovative tactics to deal with difficult terrain , ordering the advance of six brigades by heavy skirmish lines , which allowed his men to deliver a continuous fire into the enemy , while proving to be elusive targets themselves . Wilderness historian Edward Steere attributed much of the success of the Army to \" the display of tactical genius by Longstreet which more than redressed his disparity in numerical strength . \" After the war , the Union II Corps commander that day , Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock , said to Longstreet of this flanking maneuver : \" You rolled me up like a wet blanket . \" Longstreet was wounded during the assault \u2014 accidentally shot by his own men only about 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) away from the place where Jackson suffered the same fate a year earlier . A bullet passed through his shoulder , severing nerves , and tearing a gash in his throat . Micah Jenkins , who was riding with Longstreet , was also shot and died from his wounds . The momentum of the attack subsided . As he was taken from the field , Longstreet urged Lee to press the attack . Instead , Lee delayed further movement until units could be realigned , giving the Union defenders adequate time to reorganize . The subsequent attack was a failure . E.P. Alexander called the removal of Longstreet the critical juncture of the battle : \" I have always believed that , but for Longstreet 's fall , the panic which was fairly underway in Hancock 's [ II ] Corps would have been extended & have resulted in Grant 's being forced to retreat back across the Rapidan . \" Longstreet missed the rest of the 1864 spring and summer campaign , where Lee sorely missed his skill in handling the army . He was treated in Lynchburg , Virginia , and recuperated in Augusta , Georgia , with his niece , Emma Eve Longstreet Sibley , the daughter of his brother Gilbert . While in Augusta , he participated in the funeral service for Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk at Saint Paul 's Church , joining the Bishops of Mississippi and Arkansas in casting earth onto the coffin . He rejoined Lee in October 1864 , with his right arm paralyzed and in a sling , initially unable to ride a horse . He had taught himself to write with his left hand ; by periodically pulling on his arm , as advised by doctors , he was able to regain use of his right hand in later years . For the remainder of the Siege of Petersburg he commanded the defenses in front of the capital of Richmond , including all forces north of the James River and Pickett 's Division at Bermuda Hundred . He retreated with Lee in the Appomattox Campaign , commanding both the First and Third Corps , following the death of A.P. Hill on April 2 . As Lee considered surrender , Longstreet advised him of his belief that Grant would treat them fairly , but as Lee rode toward Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 , Longstreet said , \" General , if he does not give us good terms , come back and let us fight it out . \" = = Post-bellum life = = After the war , Longstreet and his family settled in New Orleans , a location popular with a number of former Confederate generals . He entered into a cotton brokerage partnership there and also became the president of the newly created Great Southern and Western Fire , Marine and Accident Insurance Company . He actively sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was unsuccessful , and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from New Orleans to Monterrey , Mexico . ( In 1870 , he was named president of the newly organized New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad . ) He applied for a pardon from President Andrew Johnson , endorsed by his old friend Ulysses S. Grant . Johnson refused , however , telling Longstreet in a meeting : \" There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty : Mr. Davis , General Lee , and yourself . You have given the Union cause too much trouble . \" Regardless of such opposition the United States Congress restored his rights of citizenship in June 1868 . Longstreet was the only senior Confederate officer to join the Republican Party during Reconstruction . He endorsed Grant for president in 1868 , attended his inauguration ceremonies , and six days later received an appointment as surveyor of customs in New Orleans . For these acts he lost favor with many white Southerners . His old friend Harvey Hill wrote to a newspaper : \" Our scalawag is the local leper of the community . \" Unlike Northerners who moved South and were sometimes referred to as \" Carpetbaggers , \" Hill wrote , Longstreet \" is a native , which is so much the worse . \" The Republican governor of Louisiana appointed Longstreet the adjutant general of the state militia and by 1872 he became a major general in command of all militia and state police forces within New Orleans . During protests of election irregularities in 1874 , referred to as the Battle of Liberty Place , an armed force of 8,400 White League members advanced on the State House . Longstreet commanded a force of 3,600 Metropolitan Police , city policemen , and African-American militia troops , armed with two Gatling guns and a battery of artillery . He rode to meet the protesters but was pulled from his horse , shot by a spent bullet , and taken prisoner . The White League charged , causing many of Longstreet 's men to flee or surrender . There were casualties of 38 killed and 79 wounded . Federal troops were required to restore order . Longstreet 's use of black troops during the disturbances increased the denunciations by anti-Reconstructionists . In 1875 the Longstreet family left New Orleans with concerns over health and safety , returning to Gainesville , Georgia . By this time Louise had given birth to ten children , five of whom lived to adulthood . He applied for various jobs through the Rutherford B. Hayes administration and was briefly considered for Secretary of the Navy . He served briefly as deputy collector of internal revenue and as postmaster of Gainesville . In 1880 Hayes appointed Longstreet as his ambassador to the Ottoman Empire , and later he served from 1897 to 1904 , under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt , as U.S. Commissioner of Railroads , succeeding Wade Hampton III . On one of his frequent return trips to New Orleans on business , Longstreet converted to Catholicism in 1877 and was a devout believer until his death . He served as a U.S. Marshal from 1881 to 1884 , but the return of a Democratic administration ended his political careers and he went into semiretirement on a 65-acre ( 26 ha ) farm near Gainesville , where he raised turkeys and planted orchards and vineyards on terraced ground that his neighbors referred to jokingly as \" Gettysburg . \" A devastating fire on April 9 , 1889 ( the 24th anniversary of Lee 's surrender at Appomattox ) destroyed his house and many of his personal possessions , including his personal Civil War documents and memorabilia . That December Louise Longstreet died . He remarried in 1897 , in a ceremony at the governor 's mansion in Atlanta , to Helen Dortch , age 34 . Although Longstreet 's children reacted poorly to the marriage , Helen became a devoted wife and avid supporter of his legacy after his death . She outlived him by 58 years , dying in 1962 . After Louise 's death , and after bearing criticism of his war record from other Confederates for decades , Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox , a labor of five years that was published in 1896 . His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness . In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism and was unable to stand for more than a few minutes at a time . His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903 . Cancer developed in his right eye , and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it . He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville , six days before his 83rd birthday . Longstreet 's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery . He outlived most of his detractors , and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century . = = Legacy = = Criticism from authors in the Lost Cause movement attacked Longstreet 's war career for many years after his death . Knudsen maintains that because Longstreet became a \" reconstructed rebel \" , embraced equal rights for blacks , unification of the nation , and reconstruction , he became the target of those who wanted to maintain racist policies and otherwise could not accept the verdict of the battlefield . The attacks formally began on January 19 , 1872 , the anniversary of Robert E. Lee 's birth , and less than two years after Lee 's death . Jubal Early , in a speech at Washington College , exonerated Lee of his failure at Gettysburg and falsely accused Longstreet of attacking late on the second day and of being responsible for the debacle on the third . The following year William N. Pendleton , Lee 's artillery chief , claimed in the same venue that Longstreet disobeyed an explicit order to attack at sunrise on July 2 . Both of these allegations were fabrications ; however , Longstreet failed to challenge these lies publicly until 1875 . The delay was damaging to his reputation , as the Lost Cause mythology had taken hold in common opinion by this time . In the 20th century Douglas Southall Freeman kept criticism of Longstreet foremost in Civil War scholarship in his biography of Lee . Clifford Dowdey , a Virginia newspaperman and novelist , was noted for his severe criticism of Longstreet in the 1950s and 1960s . After Longstreet 's death , his second wife Helen privately published Lee and Longstreet at High Tide in his defense , in which she stated \" the South was seditiously taught to believe that the Federal Victory was wholly the fortuitous outcome of the culpable disobedience of General Longstreet . \" The publication of Michael Shaara 's novel The Killer Angels in 1974 , based in part on Longstreet 's memoirs , followed by its 1993 film adaptation , Gettysburg , have been credited with helping to restore Longstreet 's reputation as a general and to dramatically raise his public visibility . The 1982 work by Thomas L. Connolly and Barbara L. Bellows , God and General Longstreet , provided a \" further upgrading of Longstreet through an attack on Lee , the Lost Cause , and the Virginia revisionists . \" Jeffry D. Wert wrote that \" Longstreet ... was the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia ; in fact , he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side . \" Richard L. DiNardo wrote \" Even Longstreet 's most virulent critics have conceded that he put together the best staff employed by any commander , and that his de facto chief of staff , Lieutenant Colonel G. Moxley Sorrel , was the best staff officer in the Confederacy . \" DiNardo cited the effective way in which Longstreet delegated responsibilities for control of battlefield movements to his staff and how they were able to communicate with him more effectively during battles than the staffs of other Confederate generals during the war . = = = In memoriam = = = Longstreet is remembered through numerous places that bear his name in and around Gainesville , Georgia , including Longstreet Bridge , a portion of U.S. Route 129 that crosses the Chattahoochee River ( later dammed to form Lake Sidney Lanier ) , and the local Longstreet Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy . In 1998 , one of the last monuments erected at Gettysburg National Military Park was dedicated as a belated tribute to Longstreet , an equestrian statue by sculptor Gary Casteel . He is shown riding on a depiction of his favorite horse , Hero , at ground level in a grove of trees in Pitzer Woods \u2014 unlike most generals , who are elevated on tall bases overlooking the battlefield . The Longstreet Society is an organization and museum in Gainesville , dedicated to the celebration and study of his life and career . The General Longstreet Recognition Project is an educational project of the Agribusiness Council Heritage Preservation Committee aimed at broadening public awareness of Longstreet 's military and public service . Longstreet 's Billet , the house in Russellville , Tennessee , that Longstreet occupied during the winter of 1863 \u2013 64 , has been converted into The Longstreet Museum , open to the public . = = In popular culture = = Longstreet plays a prominent role in Michael Shaara 's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1974 novel The Killer Angels . He is portrayed in the 1993 film Gettysburg ( based on the The Killer Angels ) by Tom Berenger , and in the prequel , Gods and Generals ( 2003 ) , by Bruce Boxleitner . He was portrayed by Brian Amidei onstage in the world premiere of The Killer Angels at the Lifeline Theatre in Chicago . Longstreet is a character in a number of prominent alternate history novels : Robert Skimin 's Gray Victory ( 1988 ) , Robert Conroy 's 1901 ( 1995 ) , and Harry Turtledove 's Southern Victory Series : Volume 1 : How Few Remain ( 1997 ) . Longstreet appears as a character in Row After Row , a full length one act play by American playwright , Jessica Dickey . The action of the play takes place in the evening after a re-enactment of Gettysburg . One re-enactor , Cal , plays Longstreet in the battle . In parts of the play , the action moves to the moments leading up to Pickett 's Charge . The play ends with tormented Longstreet addressing the future as he wonders if we will ever form a \" more perfect union . \"",

                    "text": "Thomas Pownall = Thomas Pownall ( bapt . 4 September 1722 ( New Style ) \u2013 25 February 1805 ) was a British politician and colonial official . He was governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1757 to 1760 , and afterward served in the British Parliament . He travelled widely in the North American colonies prior to the American Revolutionary War , opposed Parliamentary attempts to tax the colonies , and was a minority advocate of colonial positions until the Revolution . Classically educated and well-connected to the colonial administration in London , Pownall first travelled to North America in 1753 , and spent two years exploring the colonies before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey in 1755 . He became governor of Massachusetts in 1757 after helping engineer the recall of longtime Governor William Shirley . His administration was dominated by the French and Indian War ( called the \" Seven Years War \" in England ) in which Pownall was instrumental in raising Massachusetts provincial militia for the war effort . He opposed military interference in colonial administration , including attempts to quarter British troops in private homes , and had a generally positive relationship with the colonial assembly . Returning to England in 1760 , he continued to be interested in colonial affairs , publishing widely read materials on conditions in the colonies , including several editions of The Administration of the Colonies . As a Member of Parliament he regularly advocated for colonial positions without much success , but supported the war effort once the Revolutionary War began . In the early 19th century he became an early advocate of the reduction or removal of trade barriers , and the establishment of a solid relationship between Britain and the United States . Several writers have proposed that Pownall was Junius , a pseudonymous writer of letters critical of British governmental practices . John Adams wrote , \" Pownall was the most constitutional and national Governor , in my opinion , who ever represented the crown in this province . \" = = Early life = = Thomas Pownall was the eldest son of William and Sarah ( Burniston ) Pownall . His father was a country gentleman and soldier whose poor health and early death in 1735 caused the family to fall upon hard times . Baptised 4 September 1722 ( New Style ) in Lincoln , England , Thomas was educated at Lincoln Grammar School and at Trinity College , Cambridge , where he graduated in 1743 . His education exposed him to classic and current philosophers , and the sciences . His first publication , a treatise on the origins of government published in 1752 , began as notes developed at Cambridge . During his years at Cambridge , his younger brother John acquired a job at the Board of Trade , which oversaw British colonial affairs , and rapidly rose in the bureaucracy . The brothers were influential supporters of each other in their efforts to advance . John secured a job for Thomas in the colonial office , where he was exposed to the possibilities for advancement and influence in colonial postings . In 1753 he went to America as private secretary to Sir Danvers Osborne , just appointed governor of New York . Osborne committed suicide several days after reaching New York , leaving Pownall without a job and a sponsor . Pownall chose to remain in America , devoting himself to studying the condition of the American colonies . In the following months he travelled widely , from Maryland to Massachusetts . He was introduced into the highest circles of leadership and society in the colonies , and established relationships with a number of influential people , including Benjamin Franklin and Massachusetts Governor William Shirley . One item of importance that Governor Osborne had been instructed to deal with was rising discontent among the Iroquois whose territory abutted New York ( and is now central and western Upstate New York ) . Pownall had studied the matter , and he was consequently invited by his Pennsylvania connections to attend the 1754 Albany Congress as an observer . His observations on the nature of colonial dealings with the Indians ( including political infighting for control of the Indian trade , and the corrupt and fraudulent acquisition of Indian lands ) led him to draft a number of proposals related to colonial administration . He proposed the establishment of a crown-appointed superintendent of Indian affairs , specifically William Johnson , New York 's commissioner for Indian affairs . He also articulated visions for managing the expansion of the colonies to the west . After the conference he returned to Philadelphia . In this time he apparently cemented a close friendship with Franklin , with whom he began to invest in business ventures . Franklin , who had unsuccessfully proposed colonial union at the Albany conference , may have contributed to Pownall 's writings , although the exact nature of his influence is unclear . While in Philadelphia he also established a close collaboration with cartographer Lewis Evans , both of whom recognized the need for accurate maps of the inland regions of North America then being disputed with New France in the French and Indian War . The map Evans published in 1755 was dedicated to Pownall , and brought the latter wide publicity . Pownall 's recommendation of Johnson as superintendent of Indian affairs was also implemented by the crown in 1755 . = = Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey = = Pownall had been living at his own expense , in the hopes that a posting would eventually come his way . In May 1755 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey , with little responsibility beyond anticipating the death of the aging governor , Jonathan Belcher , and attending military conferences concerning the ongoing war . Belcher , however , proved to be longer lived than expected ( he died in 1757 ) , and Pownall was restless . The military conferences drew him into an ongoing power struggle between Johnson and Shirley ( who rose to become military commander-in-chief upon the death of General Edward Braddock in July 1755 ) over the management of Indian affairs . Johnson capitalized on Pownall 's concern over frontier security to draw him into his camp . Pownall already harboured some dislike of Shirley over an earlier snub , and his reports to New York Governor Sir Charles Hardy , combined with damaging allegations provided by other Johnson supporters , led to Shirley 's dismissal as commander-in-chief . Pownall returned to England in early 1756 , where he confirmed the Johnson allegations , and was rewarded with a post as \" Secretary Extraordinary \" ( a title of Pownall 's creation ) to the new commander-in-chief , Lord Loudoun . While Pownall was in England , Shirley 's reputation was further damaged by allegations ( not apparently furthered by Pownall 's action ) that he had let military information fall into enemy hands , and the Board of Trade decided to recall him . Pownall was also offered the governorship of Pennsylvania by its proprietors ; however , his demands for wide-ranging powers in the post led them to retract the offer . Pownall turned this to his own advantage , widely publicizing the fact that he had turned down the offer because of the \" unreasonable , unenlightened attitude of the proprietors . \" He accompanied Loudoun back to America in July 1756 , but again returned to England to represent Loudoun in hearings on Shirley 's military leadership . Loudoun also instructed him on his military plans and objectives . In London he became closely involved in informing members of the new Pitt-Newcastle Ministry of the state of affairs in North America . His performance in these matters resulted in his appointment as governor of Massachusetts in March 1757 . Although he was admired for his competence in colonial affairs , he was also criticised for his vanity and temper , as well as his role in bringing about Shirley 's fall . = = Governor of Massachusetts Bay = = Pownall arrived in Boston in early August . He was well received , and assumed his duties on August 3 . He was immediately thrust into a war-related crisis : a French force was reported to be moving toward Fort William Henry in northern New York , and the military commander there had made an urgent call for militia . Pownall was energetic in organizing the militia , but the call to arms came too late : Fort William Henry fell after a brief siege that was followed by some of the worst Indian atrocities of the war . In September 1757 Pownall travelled to New Jersey to attend the funeral of Governor Jonathan Belcher , and stopped in New York to meet with Loudoun . The commander-in-chief was upset that the Massachusetts General Court had not fully implemented a variety of demands he had made , and he held Pownall responsible . Pownall objected to the interference of the military in civilian affairs , the threat of which Loudoun used to implement his agenda , maintaining that it was necessary for the governor to lead , not drive , the provincial assembly . The meeting was acrimonious , and Loudoun afterward wrote a letter to London harshly criticising Pownall 's position , calling his ideas on governance \" high-handed \" . Loudoun encountered opposition in the General Court ( the provincial assembly ) to a demand that British troops be billeted with civilians in Boston , and threatened to march additional troops into the province and take housing by force . Pownall requested that the General Court accede in some way to Loudoun 's demands , eventually signing a bill authorizing the quartering of troops in inns and other public spaces . This bill was unpopular , and Pownall was negatively cast in the local press as supportive of Loudoun and his policies . Pownall 's exchanges with Loudoun , however , show that he was keenly aware of the colonists ' position : \" the inhabitants of this province are intitled to the natural rights of English born subjects ... the enjoyment of these rights ... will animate and encourage them to resist ... a cruel , invading enemy \" . He was equally clear on the relationship between the royal governor and his assembly : \" a governor must endeavour to lead those people for he cannot drive them and must lead them step by step as he can gett [ sic ] footing . \" He was so committed to these ideas that he offered to resign ; however Loudoun encouraged him to remain in the post . Pownall would later author portions of the 1765 Quartering Act , a Parliamentary bill whose implementation was widely resisted in the colonies . In January 1758 Pownall wrote several letters to William Pitt , outlining the difficult issues surrounding relations between the colonial government and both the military and civil administrations of the British establishment . He specifically recommended that London offer to pay more of the colonial expenses of the war ; the implementation of this idea led to significantly increased militia recruitment in the remaining years of the war , including 7,000 men from Massachusetts for the 1758 campaign . Pownall was able to move a bill through the General Court implementing reforms of the militia system . The bill did not include all of the changes Pownall sought in order to achieve a more flexible and less costly organization , and its terms also centered more power over the militia in the hands of local officials ( reducing the governor 's control ) . Despite these reforms , recruiting for the militia proved difficult , and recruiting parties were often harassed and stoned , leading to rioting on several occasions . Pownall was , however , successful in recruiting the province 's full quota of militia , and his energetic assistance in the war effort earned him approbation from William Pitt , the Board of Trade , and the new commander-in-chief , James Abercrombie . Flush with success , Pownall proposed to General Jeffery Amherst the idea of establishing a fort on Penobscot Bay to contest potential French movements in the area . The area had been the site of periodic frontier raids since 1755 , including a major attack on St. George in spring 1758 . This idea developed into a major expedition to the area , which received not only Amherst 's approval but that of the assembly . Pownall led the expedition , oversaw the construction of Fort Pownall , and counted it as a major success of the year . Its success kicked off a minor land rush in the area . Although Pownall 's start in power was a little rocky , his popularity in the province grew as his term progressed . He assiduously saw to the needs of its many fishermen , successfully convincing military authorities to eliminate burdensome red tape , and courted local merchants . He invested in ventures managed by Thomas and John Hancock , and was lauded by a group of Massachusetts merchants upon his departure . A bachelor , he was reported to be a ladies ' man and highly engaged in the social scene . Although he was not strongly religious , he regularly attended Anglican services , but was also a frequent visitor to local Congregational services . He successfully finessed contentious issues surrounding the recruitment , deployment , and provisioning of militia , negotiating compromises between military and provincial demands . He did , however , have a strained relationship with his lieutenant governor , Thomas Hutchinson . The two men never trusted each other , and Pownall regularly excluded Hutchinson from his inner council meetings , instead sending him on missions , for example to deal with militia recruitment issues . One of Pownall 's last acts before leaving the colony was to approve the appointment of James Otis , Sr. , a longtime Hutchinson adversary , as speaker of the assembly . In the later months of 1759 Pownall wrote a letter to William Pitt requesting leave to return to England because \" I might be of some service \" there . Biographer John Schutz speculates that the underlying reason for Pownall 's request were related to frustration with his exclusion from the major military actions of the later war years , and possibly his desire to acquire a more significant post , such as a governor-generalship of conquered New France . Historian Bernard Bailyn is of the opinion that Pownall 's divisive dislike and distrust of Shirley supporters like Thomas Hutchinson and ensuing local political infighting contributed to the request , as did his difficult relationships with the military commanders . Whatever the reason , the Board of Trade engaged in a reshuffling of colonial positions after King George II died , and Pownall was given the governorship of South Carolina , and permission to first take leave in England . His departure from Boston was delayed by militia recruiting issues and the need to deal with the aftermath of a major fire in the city , and he did not leave until June 1760 . = = The Administration of the Colonies = = Although he held the governorship of South Carolina , he never actually went there . He characterised his term in Massachusetts as \" arduous \" , and informed the colonial office in November 1760 that he would only accept another governorship if the recently acceded King George III directly ordered it . Pitt appointed him to the military commissary 's office in the Electorate of Hanover , where he served until the Seven Years ' War ended in 1763 . The position did not further his career ambitions in colonial administration , however , and led to allegations of financial irregularities ( of which he was cleared ) . Upon his return to England he prepared for publication a treatise entitled The Administration of the Colonies . First published anonymously in 1764 , Pownall revised the work and republished the work several times between 1765 and 1777 . The work , a dry and complex treatise on the situation in North America that included commentary on the burgeoning tensions in the Thirteen Colonies , was intended by Pownall to explore how the colonies could properly be incorporated into a larger empire . Pownall 's work identified him as supportive of American liberty . Although he feared that Britain was losing control of its colonies , he wrote that the Americans were entitled to the same rights of representative government as their fellow subjects in England , Scotland , and Wales . At the same time , he insisted that the military protection that the colonists received from Britain created equally extensive obligations to help pay for some of the cost . He was also convinced of the need for a strong , central legislature capable of making common policies that would be binding for every member of the British empire , including the fractious provinces in North America . Pownall eventually decided that the only solution lay in creating an imperial parliament with representatives from both Britain and the colonies . Although he was not the only British commentator to embrace the idea of an imperial parliament , most Americans found it anathema , so much so that John Dickinson singled out his centralized plan of legislative reform for particular criticism in his influential Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania ( 1768 ) . = = Colonial supporter = = Pownall continued to communicate with political allies in Massachusetts , and was on several occasions called to appear before Parliamentary committees to comment on colonial affairs . He considered returning to Massachusetts if a post could be found , and began investing in property in Nova Scotia , extending his colonial property interests beyond those he had been granted in Maine during his governorship . In 1765 he married Harriet Fawkener , widow of Everard Fawkener and daughter to Lieutenant General Charles Churchill , giving him a connection to the aristocratic Dukes of Marlborough . Pownall raised her four children as his own . A gracious and intelligent woman , she became a partner in advancing his political career , hosting social events and encouraging his intellectual pursuits . She may have encouraged him to stand for Parliament in 1767 , when he won a seat representing Tregony . He renewed correspondence with officials in Massachusetts in the hopes of winning appointment as an agent representing the province 's interests , but was unsuccessful . He regularly received visitors from the colonies , and Benjamin Franklin , his old friend from Pennsylvania , was a frequent guest . He observed with alarm the rise in tension in the colonies and the missteps of Parliamentary leadership and colonial administration that exacerbated rather than reduced them . He used his position in Parliament to highlight the colonial objections to the Quartering Act of 1765 and other unpopular legislation . When troops were sent to Boston in 1768 after protests against the Townshend Acts turned violent , he took to the floor of Parliament , warning that the connections between Britain and the colonies were unraveling , and that the end result could be a permanent breach . Pownall was opposed to Lord North 's partial repeal in 1770 of the hated Townshend Acts , in which the tax on tea was retained as a symbol of Parliamentary power . In debate on the act , Pownall pointed out that retention of the tax would be a \" millstone \" around English necks rather than a yoke on American ones , and that it would lead to civil war . His speech was delivered March 5 , 1770 , the day of the Boston Massacre . Dispirited by his view that Parliament failed to understand the American colonial issues , he urged his colonial correspondents to continue to press constitutional issues and avoid violence . Colonial American issues then briefly subsided from the stage . In 1772 Pownall introduced legislation reforming food production and distribution in Great Britain . It passed the House of Commons , but was amended by the Lords , leading the Commons to reject the amended bill as a violation of its prerogatives . The bill passed the next year , and was called \" Governor Pownall 's Bill \" . It received much praise , including some from influential figures such as Adam Smith . Pownall was also honoured with membership in the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society . = = Revolution = = Following the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 , Parliament passed a series of bills designed to punish Massachusetts . Pownall was unable to sway opinion toward more conciliatory measures . He was also implicated in the Hutchinson Letters Affair as someone who may have delivered private letters of Thomas Hutchinson to Benjamin Franklin , although Franklin never identified his source for the letters . Pownall was unable to retain his seat : in 1774 he was voted out of office . Seeking to remain active , Pownall ended up appealing to Lord North , who secured a seat for him in a by-election , representing Minehead . This apparent turn towards Toryism alarmed a number of Pownall 's colonial supporters ; there is also some evidence that North may have engineered Pownall 's defeat in order to gain his support . Pownall supported North 's attempts at reconciliation in debates leading to the start the War of Independence . However , once hostilities began in April 1775 , his conciliatory views were dismissed by war-supporting Tories ( who opposed them ) as well as by Whigs ( who saw his proposals as attempts to undercut their positions ) . Pownall remained nominally in support of North until 1777 , when he openly made declarations in support of the peace party . The entry of France into the war on the American side returned him firmly to the pro-war Tory position . His support was , however , nuanced : he continued to argue for some sort of conciliation with the Americans , while remaining resolutely patriotic with respect to the French . He was not alone among British politicians in being unable reconcile these positions , and refused to stand for reelection in 1780 . During the war years he published several revisions to The Administration of the Colonies , updating and expanding the work to reflect changing conditions . He also worked to update and revise the Evans map , soliciting data and updated maps from colonial correspondents . He withdrew to some extent in the later years following the death of his wife in 1777 , but continued to appear in Parliament . = = Post-war years = = In July 1780 Pownall anonymously published an essay titled A Memorial Most Humbly Addressed to the Sovereigns of Europe . This widely published document gained Pownall attention throughout Europe ; the anonymity of its author was compromised by the use of extended passages from Administration of the Colonies . The essay propounded instructions to Europe 's leaders on how to deal with a newly independent United States , pointing out that America 's independence and rapid population growth would have a transformative effect on world trade . He proposed that European leaders meet to establish worldwide regulations for what was essentially free trade . Pownall continued to maintain an interest in the United States after the war ended , although he never returned . He sought without success a commission in the Massachusetts militia , mostly as a formality so that he could present it during his European travels . He continued to write essays ( new ones and revisions to older ones ) , and published an updated version of his 1755 map . In his later years Pownall was introduced to Francisco de Miranda , a Venezuelan colonial general who favored Latin American independence from Spain . According to historian William Spence Robertson , significant arguments advanced by Miranda in his later efforts are traceable to Pownall 's influence . Pownall also assisted Miranda explicitly , cultivating connections in the British government as he attempted to advance the independence agenda . Pownall 's last major work was a treatise again arguing for free trade , and explicitly calling for British support of Latin American independence as a way to open those markets to British and American trade . Pownall died at Bath on 25 February 1805 , and was interred in the church at Walcot . = = Thomas Pownall as an Antiquary = = While Thomas Pownall is well known as an American colonial Governor and English politician , he was also an important figure in later 18th century antiquarian and archaeological studies . In her study of Governor Pownall , Bryony Orme remarks that he is perhaps one of the most neglected of our early antiquaries , and undeservedly so . He inherited these interests from his father Captain William Pownall , who lived at No. 5 Pottergate in the Minster Yard , which surrounds Lincoln Cathedral . His father had corresponded with William Stukeley about ancient finds in and around Lincoln , and Thomas Pownall \u2019 s brother John was also a writer on archaeological subjects . Pownall was already demonstrating his interest in archaeology before he left for America , when , in 1752 , he recorded evidence for a Roman villa at Glentworth in Lincolnshire After his return from America he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1770 and he contributed extensively to early issues of the journal Archaeologia . Some of his writings describe discoveries around Lincoln , but more importantly he wrote more widely on New Grange in Ireland in 1773 and Cairn Brach y Dinas at Penmaenmawr , on the north Welsh coast . He was to follow this with descriptions of Roman remains in France when he was living there , and , on moving to Bath he again provided descriptions of Roman discoveries . = = Family and legacy = = Pownall married twice . His first wife was Harriet Churchill , widow of Sir Everard Fawkener and illegitimate daughter of Lieutenant General Charles Churchill . In 1784 Pownall married Hannah ( Kennet ) Astell , acquiring in the process significant estates and the trappings of landed gentry . The towns of Pownal , Maine and Pownal , Vermont are named after Thomas Pownall . Dresden , Maine was once named Pownalborough in his honour ; this recognition survives in the Pownalborough Courthouse , an historic property built there in 1761 . The remains of Fort Pownall , named for him , survive in Maine 's Fort Point State Park . = = Junius = = Between 1769 and 1772 a series of letters was published in London 's Public Advertiser , written by someone using the pseudonym Junius . Many of the letters contained accusations of corruption and abuse of power on the part of British government officials , subjects Pownall also spoke and wrote about . The identity of Junius has since been the subject of contemporary and historical debate . In 1854 Frederick Griffin wrote Junius Uncovered , in which he advanced the argument that Pownall was Junius ; this argument was again raised by Pownall descendant Charles A. W. Pownall in his 1908 biography of Pownall . Modern scholars dispute the notion , currently favouring Philip Francis as the writer of the letters based on several lines of evidence . = = = Publications by Thomas Pownall = = = A Description of the Sepulchral Monument of New Grange , near Drogheda , in the County of Meath , in Ireland .

                    "text": "Rule of law doctrine in Singapore = In Singapore , the rule of law doctrine has been the topic of considerable disagreement and debate , largely through differing conceptions of the doctrine . These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics , the \" thin \" , or formal , conception and the \" thick \" , or substantive , conception of the rule of law . The thin conception , often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz , advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements , such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective , clear , stable and constitutionally enacted , and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges . While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law , they take the view that this is a matter of substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of the rule of law . On the other hand , the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule , it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights . A thin conception of the rule of law has generally been adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People 's Action Party , as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law . However , a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore . On the other hand , a thick conception of the rule of law that encompasses human rights has been adopted by a number of Government critics , including opposition politicians , and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch , Lawyers ' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project . Some of the key principles associated with the thin conception of the rule of law include judicial independence , natural justice , the availability of judicial review , and the accessibility of justice . Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules , though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence . One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General 's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference . In Singapore , natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept . The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules , and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy . The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry . For those taking a thick conception of the rule of law , the existence of the Internal Security Act ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) ( \" ISA \" ) is widely regarded as a breach of the doctrine . The Act , which provides for detention without trial for people regarded by the executive as a risk to national security , is shielded from unconstitutionality by Article 149 of the Constitution . Although the Court of Appeal held in the 1988 case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs that the courts could review the legality of detentions under the Act , the effect of the case was reversed through amendments to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 . The ISA amendments were determined to be effective by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs in 1989 and 1990 respectively . While the executive 's largely unconstrained discretion to detain under the ISA has been criticized as contrary to the rule of law , the Government has justified the statute as a crucial measure of last resort for preserving security . = = Introduction = = There have been many attempts to define the rule of law . Academics over the years have come up with various formulations and ideas of what the doctrine should mean . The range of views can roughly be divided into two categories : the \" thin \" , or formal , conception and the \" thick \" , or substantive , conception of the rule of law . = = = Thin conception of the rule of law = = = The \" thin \" conception rule of law advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements . People who subscribe to the thin conception are not apathetic towards the content of the law . However , as Ronald Dworkin says , \" [ t ] hey say that this is a matter of substantive justice , and that substantive justice is an independent ideal , in no sense part of the ideal of the rule of law \" . The thin conception of the rule of law is often associated with two academics , Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz . According to Dicey , the rule of law may be regarded from three points of view : The absolute supremacy of regular law \u2013 a person is to be judged by a fixed set of rules and punished for breaching only the law , and is not to be subject to \" the exercise by persons in authority of wide , arbitrary , or discretionary powers of constraint \" . \" Legal equality \" , that is , \" the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts \" . The fact that the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land . In other words , it is not the source but the consequence of the citizens ' rights . Raz expressed a similar view . Expanding on the concept in a 1977 article , he said that , in its broadest sense , the rule of law means that people should obey the law and be ruled by it . On the other hand , a narrower construction of the rule of law means that the government shall be ruled by and subjected to the law . The doctrine of the rule of law also requires that \" the making of particular laws should be guided by open and relatively stable general rules \" . If the law is to be obeyed , it \" must be capable of guiding the behaviour of its subjects \" , in that people can find out what the law is and act accordingly . A number of important principles spring from the basic idea of the rule of law . These may be divided into two groups : principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects ' behaviour , and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law . Principles ensuring the law is capable of guiding behaviour . Laws should be \" prospective , open and clear \" . The meaning of the law should not be \" ambiguous , vague , obscure or imprecise \" , and the law must be sufficiently publicized . Furthermore , laws should generally not be retroactive ; but if a retroactive law is to be enacted , the fact that this is going to be done must be known for certain to ensure that the retroactivity does not clash with the rule of law . Laws should be relatively stable and not changed too often , as with frequently changing laws it may be hard for people to keep themselves updated . People need to know what the law is both for short- and long-term planning . The making of particular or specific laws should be \" guided by open , stable , clear and general rules \" that create a stable framework . There are two types of general rules : those which empower authorities to make orders , and those which provide guidelines for the proper exercise of such powers . Principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law . Judicial independence is essential . It would be futile for people to approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law independently . Moreover , people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly . Natural justice must be adhered to . For the law to be applied correctly , requirements such as an open and fair hearing and an absence of bias are essential . Courts must have the power to review primary and subsidiary legislation , and administrative action . The courts should be accessible , since if cases are delayed for long periods , legal costs are prohibitive , and so on , this may \" effectively turn the most enlightened law to a dead letter and frustrate one 's ability effectively to guide oneself by the law \" . Although crime-preventing agencies such as the police and prosecuting authorities must have some discretion to act , they should not be allowed to \" pervert the law \" . For example , the police should not be allowed to decide to stop investigating , nor the prosecution be allowed to choose not to prosecute , certain crimes or certain categories of offenders . In Raz 's view , one of the virtues of the rule of law is the restraint it imposes on authorities . It aims to exclude arbitrary power as it is said that most of the exercises of arbitrary power violate the rule of law . Arbitrary power is excluded when courts hold themselves accountable only to the law and observe \" fairly strict procedures \" . Another virtue is the protection it accords to individual freedom , namely , \" the sense of freedom in which it is identified with an effective ability to choose between as many options as possible \" . Most importantly , to adhere to the rule of law is to respect human dignity by \" treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future \" . Raz also identified some of the potential pitfalls of the rule of law . He opined that as the rule of law is designed \" to minimise the harm to freedom and dignity which the law may cause in its pursuit of its goals however laudable these may be \" , the strict pursuit of the rule of law may prevent one from achieving certain social goals which may be preferable to the rule of law : \" Sacrificing too many social goals on the altar of the rule of law may make the law barren and empty \" . = = = Thick conception of the rule of law = = = At the other extreme , the \" thick \" rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule , it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights . Ronald Dworkin , one of the leading scholars advocating the thick conception of the rule of law , defines what he terms the \" rights conception \" of the rule of law as follows : It assumes that citizens have moral rights and duties with respect to one another , and political rights against the state as a whole . It insists that these moral and political rights be recognized in positive law , so that they may be enforced upon the demand of individual citizens through courts or other judicial institutions of the familiar type , so far as this is practicable . The rule of law on this conception is the ideal of rule by an accurate public conception of individual rights . It does not distinguish , as the rule book conception does , between the rule of law and substantive justice ; on the contrary it requires , as part of the ideal of law , that the rules in the book capture and enforce moral rights . Paul Craig , in analysing Dworkin 's view , drew three conclusions . First , Dworkin rejects the need to distinguish between \" legal \" rules and a more complete political philosophy , since the rule of law is basically the theory of law and adjudication that he believes is correct . Secondly , the rule of law is not simply the thin or formal rule of law ; the latter forms part of Dworkin 's theory of law and adjudication . Thirdly , since taking a substantive view of the rule of law requires choosing what the best theory of justice is , it is necessary to articulate particular conceptions of what liberty , equality and other freedoms require . = = Conceptions of the rule of law taken in Singapore = = = = = Thin conception = = = On 24 November 1999 , Non-constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam moved the following motion in Parliament : \" That this House recognises the importance of the Rule of Law and urges the government to ensure the complete and full compliance of the Rule of Law by all Ministers , officials and public servants . \" During the ensuing debate , the Members of Parliament ( MPs ) from the ruling People 's Action Party tended to adhere to a thinner , or more formal , conception of the rule of law . For instance , the Minister of State for Law Ho Peng Kee said : In short , the Rule of Law refers to the supremacy of law , as opposed to the arbitrary exercise of power . The other key tenet is that everyone is equal before the law . The concept also includes the notions of the transparency , openness and prospective application of our laws , observation of the principles of natural justice , independence of the Judiciary and judicial review of administrative action . Chin Tet Yung , an MP for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency , commented that the rule of law required that : ... [ a ] ll laws are prospective , stable , properly and constitutionally enacted . The application of laws , the making of legal orders by public officers should be guided by clear and general rules , that is , avoiding any personal bias or favour , treating equal cases equally , making decisions rationally and in the public interest , and in accordance with the written laws of the land . ... In this particular principle where you have laws , obviously such laws must be applied and obviously the laws are applied by public officers who make legal orders . If these legal orders are substantiated by subsidiary legislation , if this subsidiary legislation is sanctioned by parent Acts , by the primary legislation , then any order issuing from it would be legitimate and would comply with the Rule of Law . And , if anyone is unhappy with that , there is always the next aspect or principle of the Rule of Law , and that is , that the judiciary has the power and the authority to review any administrative action . So that is the third principle . The final principle ... is that the judiciary must be independent and the courts should be generally accessible to all who seek recourse to them . Chin moved an amendment to the motion introduced by Jeyaretnam so that it read : \" That this House ( 1 ) values the importance of the Rule of Law ; and ( 2 ) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all . \" The amendment motion was eventually voted on and agreed to by a majority of MPs in Parliament . In a speech made on 27 October 2009 at a plenary session entitled Singapore and the Rule of Law at the seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore , Minister for Law K. Shanmugam said that he would not try to define the rule of law comprehensively or analyse it from an academic viewpoint , but , practically speaking , the key aspects of a society based on the rule of law are the following : Exercise of State power should be through laws that are publicly known and enacted legitimately . There should be independent , credible Courts to apply the law and decide on disputes between individuals , as well as between individuals and the State . There must be Separation of Powers . No person should be above the law . That should apply in equal measure to the Government and officials as much as it does to everyone else . There should be credible and effective means for people to challenge the arbitrary exercise of power . However , evincing a thicker conception of the rule of law , he added that most people accepted two additional elements \" as being part of how a modern civilised society should be structured \" , though he felt it was \" debatable whether they are part of a strict definition of Rule of Law \" . These elements were that \" [ t ] he people must have the sovereign right to elect their Government \" , and that \" laws must not offend that society 's norms of fairness and justice \" . = = = Thick conception = = = A number of critics of the Government of Singapore have adopted a thick , or substantive , conception of the rule of law that encompasses the protection of human rights . In a chapter entitled \" Rights and the Rule of Law \" in his 1994 book Dare to Change , Singapore Democratic Party ( SDP ) member ( and later Secretary-General ) Chee Soon Juan criticized , among other things , the Government 's use of the Internal Security Act ( \" ISA \" ) to detain persons without trial , and the lack of freedom of speech and assembly . In an open letter published on the SDP website dated 6 January 2009 which was addressed to the Chief Justice , Attorney-General and Law Minister , he said : \" [ T ] he rule of law is not just a system where the government passes legislation and everyone unquestioningly obeys . The concept of the rule of law necessitates the limitation of state power and the respect of human rights . Our Constitution spells out what these limitations are . It also defines the rights of the citizen . \" And in a speech delivered to the International Bar Association Conference in Dubai on 4 November 2011 , he cited a free media and the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly as essential elements of the rule of law . During the 24 November 1999 Parliamentary debate on the rule of law , Jeyaretnam traced the doctrine to the Magna Carta , and said that it was to be found in the Constitution of Singapore , particularly in Article 9 and Article 12 , which respectively protect the rights to life and personal liberty , and equality rights . He also noted that in the court judgment Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1980 ) , the Privy Council had held that in phrases such as \" in accordance with law \" and \" equality before the law \" in the Constitution , the term law does not only mean Acts passed by Parliament , but also includes the fundamental rules of natural justice that have been accepted and become part and parcel of the common law . He then cited eight instances of the Government 's alleged non-compliance with the rule of law , including detention without trial under , inter alia , the ISA and the Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions ) Act ( \" CLTPA \" ) ; denial of the right of arrested persons to counsel and to visits from their families for a period of time ; denial of the rights to freedom of speech and assembly ; and the tendency of the executive not to provide reasons for decisions made . Opposition MP Chiam See Tong complained that the Government had not treated opposition parties fairly as regards applications for licences for events . Criticisms about the ISA and the state of freedom of speech and assembly in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations . A 2007 report by Lawyers ' Rights Watch Canada , Rule of Law in Singapore , alleged that defamation and bankruptcy law had been used to oppress the political opposition , and expressed concern about stringent limits on the freedom of assembly and detention under the ISA . In its Rule of Law Index 2011 , the World Justice Project defined the rule of law as \" a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld \" : The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law . The laws are clear , publicized , stable , and fair , and protect fundamental rights , including the security of persons and property . The process by which the laws are enacted , administered , and enforced is accessible , fair , and efficient . Access to justice is provided by competent , independent , and ethical adjudicators , attorneys or representatives , and judicial officers who are of sufficient number , have adequate resources , and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve . [ Emphasis added . ] Singapore was ranked highly on factors such as order and security ( with a ranking of 2 out of the 66 countries assessed ) , absence of corruption ( 4 / 66 ) , and effective criminal justice ( 5 / 66 ) , but less highly on open government ( 19 / 66 ) , limited government powers ( 20 / 66 ) and fundamental rights ( 39 / 66 ) . In particular , the Index noted that \" [ n ] otwithstanding the country 's outstanding performance in most categories , there are substantial limitations on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly , with Singapore in 49th and 60th place , respectively , out of all 66 countries \" . The Human Rights Watch Singapore : Country Summary of January 2012 commented negatively on restrictions on the rights to free speech , assembly and association , such as limitations on print , broadcast and online media , and outdoor gatherings ; contempt of court proceedings against Alan Shadrake ; and the gazetting of The Online Citizen blog as a \" political association \" , thus preventing it from receiving foreign funding . It also criticized the existence of the ISA and CLTPA , the use of caning as a punishment , and the continued criminalization of sexual acts between consenting men under section 377A of the Penal Code . The Ministry of Law described the report as \" inaccurate \" and containing \" false assertions \" . = = Compliance with rule of law principles in Singapore = = = = = Principles associated with the thin conception = = = = = = = Judicial independence = = = = Raz identified judicial independence as one of the essential principles of the rule of law . In this context , judicial independence refers to the judiciary 's independence from the legislative and executive branches of the government . Singapore 's judiciary enjoys a certain measure of independence provided by various constitutional safeguards such as security of tenure and remuneration . Judges are also relatively free from executive and legislative influence . A retired Supreme Court judge , L.P. Thean , has said that it is theoretically possible for the executive to make political appointments to the Bench , to reduce a judge 's remuneration by amending the Constitution , or to take away the judiciary 's vital support staff , but \" [ t ] he fact remains , however , that nothing of that kind has ever been done \" . Various provisions of the Constitution guarantee the independence of the Supreme Court judiciary . Since Article 93 vests judicial power exclusively in the courts , judicial power is to be solely exercised by the judiciary and not by the executive or legislature , thus reflecting the former 's independence from the other branches of government . Article 94 ensures that the office of a Supreme Court Judge will \" not be abolished during his continuance in office \" , while Article 98 provides for judges ' security of tenure until the age of 65 years , barring misbehaviour , inability , infirmity of body or mind , or any other cause that prevents judges from properly discharging the functions of their office . A judge may only be removed from office on these grounds by the President on the advice of a tribunal of judges of the Supreme Court or those who hold or have held equivalent offices in the Commonwealth . Article 98 also provides that the remuneration and other terms of office of Supreme Court judges may not be altered to their disadvantage following their appointment . Article 99 restricts parliamentary debate on the conduct of a Supreme Court judge unless on a substantive motion supported by at least a quarter of all MPs . However , it has been argued by some commentators that Singapore falls short where some aspects of judicial independence are concerned . For instance , Supreme Court judges above the age of 65 may be reappointed on a term basis . It has been suggested that this may result in \" the unsavoury possibility of judges being ' beholden ' to the executive \" . This point was also raised by Jeyaretnam in Parliament in 1986 with respect to the then Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin . However , an academic has pointed out that removing entirely the system of extensions may not serve the larger interest at the end of the day if excellent judges have to retire due to the mandatory requirement . Judges of the Subordinate Courts do not enjoy the security of tenure enjoyed by the Supreme Court judges . As officers of the Singapore Legal Service , it is said that there is a risk of executive interference because judges may be removed from their judicial positions or transferred to lower-ranking positions elsewhere within the Legal Service by the Legal Service Commission ( LSC ) . In 1984 , the Senior District Judge Michael Khoo acquitted Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaratnam of all but one minor charge in a case involving cheques for the Workers ' Party of Singapore which had allegedly been fraudulently handled . The acquittal was overturned on appeal to the High Court , and a retrial ordered . However , before the retrial took place , Khoo was transferred from his position on the Bench to the Attorney-General 's Chambers to take up the post of deputy public prosecutor . This was considered to be a demotion . In 1986 , Jeyaratnam claimed in Parliament that the transfer had been made because Khoo had ruled in his favour in the 1984 case . However , a commission of inquiry formed to look into the circumstances surrounding the transfer found no evidence of this . For making the allegation , Jeyaratnam was referred to Parliament 's Committee of Privileges for abusing parliamentary privilege . While the Committee was considering the matter , Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the Committee 's proceedings and sent them to residents of his constituency . On 9 October 1986 , the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters ' contents to the Speaker of Parliament , which the Committee also considered . On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee 's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary , and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters . Fines totalling S $ 26,000 were imposed . Another concern which has been raised is that the routine shuffling of Subordinate Courts judges between the executive and judicial branches may result in them \" imbib [ ing ] the executive 's corporatist ideology , carrying that into adjudication , as a ' judiciary of amateurs ' \" . On the other hand , while a potential for executive interference exists due to the LSC 's control of Subordinate Court judicial appointments , it has been commented that in a small state like Singapore it may not be practical to have a separate judicial and legal service . Also , the appointment process may not be detrimental to the independence of the lower judiciary as the Chief Justice , who is not part of the executive or legislature , is the head of the LSC and has the final say on judicial postings . It has also been noted that , as much as institutional processes play a part in judicial independence , ultimately the willingness of judiciary to stand up to executive and legislative influence is the most important factor in ensuring an independent judiciary . Another incident said to have affected judicial independence in Singapore was the move by Parliament to amend the Constitution and the ISA to reverse the effect of the Court of Appeal 's decision Chng Suan Tze v. Minister of Home Affairs ( 1988 ) ( discussed in detail below ) . It has been asked if Parliament had \" taken away absolutely the judicial power of review for ISA preventive detention cases \" , and whether this reflected the Legislature 's \" distrust in the independence of the Judiciary and its ability to deal impartially with ISA cases that affect national security notwithstanding the limited form of judicial review laid down in Chng Suan Tze . \" Another commentator has framed it as \" an attack on the judiciary simply because it removes a vital aspect of judicial power \" and that this \" undermines judicial credibility \" . = = = = Natural justice = = = = It has been noted generally that natural justice is a fundamental element of the rule of law . In administrative law , the two principles of natural justice , which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights , are the rule against bias ( nemo iudex in causa sua , or \" no man a judge in his own cause \" ) and the right to be heard ( audi alteram partem , or \" hear the other side \" ) . In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd . & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd . ( 1978 ) , the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of \" fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties . \" Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999 , MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice , which he described thus : \" [ N ] atural justice requires essentially two basic principles . One is that you have the right to be heard and to explain your case , and , two , is the right to equal treatment . A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review . \" As was noted previously , the word law in provisions of the Constitution such as Articles 9 and 12 includes fundamental rules of natural justice . Jack Tsen-Ta Lee has suggested that these fundamental rules are both procedural and substantive in nature , and that substantive natural justice gives the courts discretion to strike down a law if its very object is unreasonable and oppressive . Under this view , to interpret Article 9 ( 1 ) as permitting Parliament to enact any provision that derogates from an individual 's personal liberty no matter how arbitrary or oppressive as long as procedural natural justice is observed , drains it of all content . Also , instead of the invalidation of legislation in this manner being seen as an encroachment by the judiciary into the legislature 's sphere , the application of substantive natural justice would simply be a full exercise of the judiciary 's proper constitutional role . Lee submits that Singapore courts should follow the Indian courts and apply a reasonableness test to determine if legislation is substantively constitutional . Ultimately , being able to review legislation by applying the substantive aspect of natural justice would \" entitle courts to examine whether it is appropriate for the legislature to deprive individual of certain aspects of their personal liberty , and the manner in which such deprivation is achieved . \" Conversely , Andrew Harding has argued that the idea of substantive natural justice is vague and subjective , and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature . In his opinion , Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation . To determine whether legislation is discriminatory , a rational nexus test is applied . It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice . Therefore , the extension of Article 12 ( 1 ) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense . Further support for this argument can be found in the Privy Council 's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor ( 1981 ) which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context , their Lordships stating that they had to consider \" whether the consequence of the alteration [ of certain statutory provisions ] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice \" . The substantive review of legislation by the court was also rejected in Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1995 ) , the Court of Appeal holding that \" any law which provides for the deprivation of a person 's life or personal liberty , is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament . The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair , just and reasonable as well . \" Subsequently , in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General ( 2011 ) , the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law \" are the same in nature and function , except that they operate at different levels of our legal order , one to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality , and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles \" . = = = = Judicial review = = = = Judicial review is the means by which legal rights are protected and good governance enforced . The ability of the courts to judicially review legislation and administrative action is considered an element of the rule of law . In R. v. Committee of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acting for the Visitor of the University of London , ex parte Vijayatunga ( 1987 ) , Judge Simon Brown said : \" Judicial review is the exercise of the court 's inherent power at common law to determine whether action is lawful or not ; in a word to uphold the rule of law \" . In Singapore , the vital role that the judiciary plays as a check on executive power was noted by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze , which held that all power given by law has legal limits and that \" the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power \" . This is further illustrated by Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis ( 2008 ) , in which it was stated that prosecutorial discretion is subject to judicial review and may be curtailed where exercised in bad faith or for extraneous purposes , or is in contravention of constitutional rights . In Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 2005 ) , the High Court held that if a litigant \" genuinely seek [ s ] the court 's assistance in vindicating or determining a legitimate grievance , the court has a duty to assess such a grievance and accord proper and serious consideration in determining whether relief should be granted \" . Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has also said it is the role of the courts in Singapore to give litigants their rights , whilst simultaneously playing a supporting role in the promotion of good governance through the articulation of clear rules and principles by which the executive can conform with the rule of law . He noted that 27.8 % of judicial review cases in Singapore since 1957 have been successful . However , certain matters are regarded as impervious to judicial review owing to limitations in the courts ' institutional capacity . Courts are generally reluctant to get involved in affairs relating to national security , leaving this role to the Government . At the same time , Singaporean courts are committed to careful scrutiny of matters to decide whether they are indeed non-justiciable , as affirmed in the Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co . Ltd . ( 2007 ) . This case held that courts would exclude matters involving \" high policy \" from their purview , but still analyse cases carefully to determine whether or not they truly fell within areas of executive immunity . Also , limitations on the role of the court have led to the rational conclusion that certain other areas are to be excluded from judicial review . These include matters in which the court lacks expertise and those which are polycentric , as was held in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General . = = = = Accessibility of justice = = = = Generally , justice is costly to provide and many legal systems , especially in Asia , are fraught with issues such as weak legal institutions , corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges , excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs and the lack of legal aid . It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law . The extent to which citizens have access to justice in any given society depends on whether a thick or thin conception of rule of law is adopted . Raz , speaking about a thin conception , proposed that the rule of the law requires courts to be accessible \u2013 that is , the legal system , at a bare minimum , should comprise formal institutions and mechanisms for administering appropriate legal processes and outcomes . A legal system complying with the thin rule of law also requires that laws are fairly , equally and effectively applied . On the other hand , when a thick conception of the rule of law is taken , a greater emphasis is placed on elements of substantive justice . It is suggested that a legal system operating as such may , in addition to the basic elements of access to justice in a thin rule of law , incorporate a moral or political philosophy , may incorporate ideas of \" democracy and legality \" , and give precedence to human rights in the administration of justice . Access to justice operating under a thick rule of law may be achieved by , among other things , increasing the efficiency of the judicial process , and having a robust legal profession , an incorruptible and independent judiciary , and a set of supporting institutions in order to increase the quality of justice administered . In Singapore , ensuring widespread and equal access to justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal . In this respect , the judiciary takes effort to ensure that both procedural and substantive elements of the rule of law are fulfilled \u2013 firstly , by continually increasing the efficiency of the courts and legal processes , and secondly , by regularly improving the skills , knowledge and values of and judges . In 1988 , the Singapore courts undertook the enormous task of clearing their extremely large backlogs in order to facilitate Singapore 's future development as an international business and finance centre . A multifaceted approach was adopted to dispose of cases expeditiously , including , among other things , the appointment of more judges and judicial commissioners , the use of information technology , electronic filing of documents and promoting the use of alternative dispute resolution . Such efforts significantly expedited the management of cases , both in the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts . In particular , specialized courts such as small claims tribunals , the Family Court and the Night Court were set up for better distribution of cases and have also helped to significantly reduce court fees . Over and above increasing the institutional capacity and efficiency of the courts , improving access to justice in Singapore has also meant a need for a corresponding increase in the quality of justice administered . Efforts to achieve this goal centre mainly on the appointment of the \" best and brightest officers \" and in particular , the constant upgrading of their skills and knowledge for judicial excellence . For this purpose , the Judicial Education Board was set up to provide guidance , training programmes and workshops for members of the judiciary , and is supported by a training unit within the Strategic Planning and Training Division of the Subordinate Courts . Such efforts aim to upgrade the competence of judges and equip them with the requisite knowledge for handling increasingly complex cases . Today , there are relatively few barriers to court access for litigants . The availability of legal aid and free mediation services aid litigants who may not be able to afford legal fees , and the use of video links and establishment of regional offices of small claims tribunals in various parts of Singapore assist parties who have difficulty coming to court . = = = Principles associated with the thick conception = = = = = = = Criticisms of the Internal Security Act = = = = As indicated above , a number of those who adopt a thick conception of the rule of law in Singapore criticize the existence of the Internal Security Act . The main point of contention is whether section 8 ( 1 ) of the Act should be interpreted in a subjective or objective way . This provision states that \" [ i ] f the President is satisfied with respect to any person that , with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any part thereof or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein , it is necessary to do so \" , the Minister for Home Affairs shall order that the person be , among other things , detained without trial for up to two years . In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1971 ) , the High Court affirmed that with respect to the President 's satisfaction that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore , mala fides or bad faith was \" not ... a justiciable issue in the context of the Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc \" . Essentially , this means that the President 's satisfaction is subjective , and not objective . The effect of this decision is that \" the Constitution left it to the executive , and not the judiciary , to decide what national security required \" . Subsequently , in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal took a different stand , holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA . ( Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended \" as the Minister sees fit \" , as well as to revoke such a direction . ) The Court said that \" the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law \" because \" all power has legal limits \" , and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court . Following this decision , the Parliament moved quickly to curb the judiciary 's change in stance . The Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 was enacted on 25 January 1989 and came into force on 30 January . In particular , section 8B ( 1 ) declared : [ T ] he law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the provisions of this Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971 ; and no part of the law before , on or after that date of any other country in the Commonwealth relating to judicial review shall apply . Section 8B ( 2 ) contained an ouster clause that restricted the scope of judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister . The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D , which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force . In addition , the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional . Article 149 ( 3 ) was inserted into the Constitution , with the effect that if the issue of whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court ( whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989 ) , the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments . Article 149 ( 1 ) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against , and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments . The validity of the 1989 ISA amendments was challenged unsuccessfully before the High Court and Court of Appeal in 1989 and 1990 respectively in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs . The High Court held that the 1989 amendments had merely reaffirmed the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng and thus could not be characterized as being contrary to the rule of law or having usurped judicial power : There is no abrogation of judicial power . It is erroneous to contend that the rule of law has been abolished by legislation and that Parliament has stated its absolute and conclusive judgment in applications for judicial review or other actions . Parliament has done no more than to enact the rule of law relating to the law applicable to judicial review . The legislation does not direct the court to enter a particular judgment or dismiss a particular case . The court is left to deal with the case on the basis of the amendments . Legislation designed against subversion must necessarily include provisions to ensure the effectiveness of preventive detention . The amendments are intended to do just that . On appeal , the Court of Appeal confirmed that it had to decide the case in accordance with the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the effect of section 8B ( 1 ) of the ISA was clear . Applying those legal principles , the Court held that the appellant had failed to prove that her detention had been made for reasons unrelated to national security . During the 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law , Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as \" there is no way of checking the Minister 's decision , who decides to make an order detaining a subject , depriving him of his liberty , completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free \" . He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed , saying : \" The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more . Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law . Let us be honest and repeal it . \" Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that \" the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception . It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister . It is in that sense a subjective discretion . \" Nonetheless , he recognized that the ISA remained relevant , for instance , as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage , and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong : \" It is a case-by-case decision , because that is how we live our lives in a real society . \" Responding to Jeyaretnam , Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions , and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act , including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public , and also the President 's personal discretion to order a detainee 's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention . Speaking at the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore , Shanmugam explained that stability was one of the essential conditions for Singapore 's governance , and that the ISA contributed to the stability of the country by enabling terrorist threats to be dealt with . In response , Michael Galligan , the Chairman of the International Section , wrote that \" whatever might be appropriate for times of extraordinary danger should not be assumed to be the measure for ordinary times . Circumscription of liberties that may have some arguable justification in a national defense crisis should not set the norm for more peaceful or more ' ordinary ' times in the life of a nation . \" In a 16 September 2011 statement , the Ministry of Home Affairs said that the Government had used the ISA \" sparingly \" , and not for detaining people solely for their political beliefs . It expressed the view that \" [ t ] he ISA continues to be relevant and crucial as a measure of last resort for the preservation of our national security \" . = = = Cases = = = Ong Ah Chuan v.

                    "text": "Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore = Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore guarantees to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law . The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications \u2013 religion , race , descent and place of birth \u2013 upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons . For example , discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . Persons unable to show that one of the forbidden classifications applies to them may try to argue that they are members of a group defined by a law in a way that violates the general guarantee of equality and equal protection . To succeed , they must establish that the classification used in the law fails the rational nexus test , which is a three-stage test formulated by the courts . The first stage of the test involves an examination as to whether the law differentiates amongst classes of individuals . At the second stage , the court considers if the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia or distinguishing feature . Finally , the basis of the differentiation must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . However , the test is not foolproof as a classification may satisfy the test even if the object of the law is itself illegitimate . The rational nexus test , as it is currently applied in Singapore , also tolerates over- and under-inclusive classifications . It remains to be seen if local courts will consider other approaches to the issue , such as the three-tier system of scrutiny applied in the United States , the proportionality analysis applied in the United Kingdom to other areas of human rights law , or the reasonableness approach taken by some judges in India and Malaysia . The rational nexus test does not apply where a statute treats all persons equally , but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner . Instead , a modified rational nexus test is used , which requires a court to consider whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law . Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination . It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency , unless this occurs on a very substantial scale . In addition , inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . = = Text of Article 12 = = Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is entitled \" Equal protection \" and reads as follows : 12 . \u2014 ( 1 ) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law . ( 2 ) Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution , there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition , holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . ( 3 ) This Article does not invalidate or prohibit \u2014 ( a ) any provision regulating personal law ; or ( b ) any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . In the 1998 decision Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong , the Court of Appeal regarded the concept of equality as a component of the wider doctrine of the rule of law , and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states : \" To none will we sell , to none will we deny , to none will we delay right or justice . \" Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying \" to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws \" , and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying \" to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India \" . Article 12 ( 1 ) is identical to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of Malaysia , from which it was adopted following Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 . In Lim Meng Suang v. Attorney-General ( 2013 ) , the High Court noted that the concept of equality before the law is derived from English common law which requires all classes of persons to be equally subject to the law , while the concept of equal protection of the law stems from the US Constitution 's Fourteenth Amendment and guarantees both procedural and substantive equality . The Court said : It will be seen that equality before the law and equal protection of the law are but different aspects of the same doctrine \u2013 equal justice . The first expresses the immutable principle of equal subjection of all classes of persons to the law , and the second is the positive aspect of that principle which reaches out , when invoked , to strike down unequal laws and discriminatory administrative or executive action as unconstitutional and void . = = Discriminatory classification = = = = = Forbidden classifications = = = Article 12 ( 2 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against Singapore citizens ( unlike Article 12 ( 1 ) which applies to \" all persons \" ) \" on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth \" in the following situations : In any law . In the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority . In the administration of any law relating to ( 1 ) the acquisition , holding or disposition of property ; or ( 2 ) the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . The word only raises the possibility that discrimination may be permissible on the basis of one of the proscribed grounds in combination with some other factor , such as age or state of health . Article 12 ( 2 ) is subject to an express contrary authorization by the Constitution . Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure that members of the Malay , Indian and other minority communities are represented in Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) . Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates , at least one of whom must be from a minority community . Article 39A ( 3 ) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12 . Another provision that is rescued from potential invalidity by Article 12 ( 2 ) is the Government 's constitutional mandate to exercise its functions in such a way as to recognize the special position of the Malays , who are the indigenous people of Singapore . The Government has a responsibility to \" protect , safeguard , support , foster and promote their political , educational , religious , economic , social and cultural interests and the Malay language \" . The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate Muslim religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the President concerning matters relating to Islam . The legislation in question is the Administration of Muslim Law Act . = = = Other discriminatory classifications : the rational nexus test = = = Aggrieved persons who cannot avail themselves of the protection afforded by Article 12 ( 2 ) may try to argue that they are a member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . The rational nexus test , also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification , is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory . The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept ; it does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Consequently , a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances , and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law . If there is no such relationship , the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid . = = = = History = = = = In 1909 , the Supreme Court of the United States propounded a test to determine the reasonableness of a classification , stating that the classification \" must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made \" . Based on this principle , the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two-stage test to determine if a classification made by a law was constitutional . The relevant stages were ( 1 ) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia ; and ( 2 ) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question . The Federal Court of Malaysia later adapted the rational nexus test by including an additional preceding stage , namely , whether the law was discriminatory . This three-stage inquiry was accepted in Singapore in the case Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor ( 1996 ) . = = = = Stages of the test = = = = The test that is currently followed in Singapore was re-expressed by the Court of Appeal in Taw Cheng Kong ( 1998 ) as comprising three stages : Whether the law differentiates \u2013 that is , prescribes different treatment \u2013 amongst classes of individuals . Whether the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia ( distinguishing feature ) . Whether the basis of differentiation bears a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . The purpose of the test is to ensure that the right to equal protection is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness . First , individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily . Secondly , the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary . Lastly , the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action . The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness . As such , a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional . = = = = = Stage 1 : Whether the law differentiates = = = = = The first stage of the test considers whether the law prescribes different treatment for one group of individuals as against other groups . For example , in the 1998 High Court decision Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor , Judge of Appeal M. Karthigesu found that the Prevention of Corruption Act differentiated between classes of people as it renders some , but not all , persons open to criminal prosecution in Singapore for offences committed outside Singapore . While earlier cases expressed this stage of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory , the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination . A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people . A discriminatory law or executive act , on the other hand , is one that contravenes Article 12 ( 1 ) and hence is unconstitutional . Therefore , the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory , as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration . If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure , it is a good law and the objection fails . Even if a differentiating measure is found , there is a strong presumption that it is constitutional . The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy . Unless the law is plainly arbitrary , suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality . It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people , and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems , hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds . Therefore , to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily . = = = = = Stage 2 : Intelligible differentia = = = = = The second stage of the rational nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group . To satisfy the second stage , there must be a discernible basis of classification . All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against . Examples of such features include gender , age , race , religion , seniority of professional qualification and area of residence . Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship . Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself , but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects , does not constitute classification . If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently , the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid . If there is an intelligible differentia , the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage . Equality under Article 12 ( 1 ) does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Similarly , failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality . As such , at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally . Article 12 ( 1 ) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others . However , the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against , and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against . The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution , whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it . The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where all members of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally . = = = = = Stage 3 : Reasonable relation to statutory objective = = = = = In this stage , it is necessary to inquire into , firstly , the object of the statute , and secondly , whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object . The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable , taking into consideration the object of the statute , to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation . As such , it is necessary to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute . The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved , and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional . In Taw Cheng Kong , the respondent challenged his conviction for corruption on the ground that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act , which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens ( but not non-citizens ) occurring outside Singapore , discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act 's object , which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it . The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations . = = = = Criticisms of the test = = = = = = = = = Unreasonable legislative objectives = = = = = In equal protection cases , the purpose of the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged . When the purpose of the law is not explicitly stated , the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose , assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it , or draw some inferences as to what it is . When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated , the court may either accept it at face value ; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration , looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose . In the latter situation , what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation . The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the \" thornier aspects of judicial review \" , because it must either \" uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value \" or \" challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference \" . The court must then \" make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end \" . This step is necessary because the rational nexus test is not foolproof . The test is based on the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution . However , if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate , a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test . Hence , the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one . In India , a solution was proffered by means of a more holistic approach to the constitutional promise of equality . In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India ( 1978 ) , the learned Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati noted that \" an essential element of equality pervades Article 14 \" , the equivalent of Singapore 's Article 12 . With that as a starting point , he went on to assert that \" the procedure ... must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary \" . The judge in Maneka Gandhi therefore spoke for a dynamic approach to equality , one that should not be \" subjected to a narrow , pedantic or lexicographic approach \" . This more liberal approach , which accords courts the latitude to deal with legislation backed by arbitrary or unreasonable objectives , was cited with approval in Malaysia by the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram in Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan ( 1996 ) . It is unclear , though , if this test will be applied in Singapore due to a dearth of case law on the matter . = = = = = Over- and under-inclusiveness = = = = = Another problem encountered when applying the rational nexus test is that of over- and under-inclusiveness . Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law . On the other hand , over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective , but also persons outside it . Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test , as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires . It has been argued that this results in the different treatment of persons in like situations , and thus violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object , the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed . However , the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm , to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest , and to advance its policies step by step . Despite this , resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness , if used indiscriminately , may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12 ( 1 ) . Similarly , where an over-inclusive classification is concerned , a rational relation still exists between the differentia adopted and the legislative object . Thus , it is tolerated under the rational nexus test in Singapore . While the effect of an over-inclusive classification may be to accord similar treatment to persons differently placed , courts have nonetheless justified it on the ground that the exigencies of the situation require such classification . The US Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States ( 1943 ) is an example of this principle . Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring , among other things , all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be \" within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. \" and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area . The defendant , Gordon Hirabayashi , was convicted of violating the curfew and the registration requirement . The order was arguably over-inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty . Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens solely on the basis of ancestry \" are , by their very nature , odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality \" , because the US was at war with Japan the race-based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order , which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack . The Court said : \" We cannot close our eyes to the fact , demonstrated by experience , that , in time of war , residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry . \" In Taw Cheng Kong , the High Court was of the view that section 37 ( 1 ) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was both under- and over-inclusive . It did not apply to non-Singapore citizens such as permanent residents and foreigners working for the Government who received bribes for acts which would be done in Singapore . On the other hand , it would catch a Singapore citizen now a foreign permanent resident employed in a foreign country by a foreign government who received a bribe in relation to a transaction that had nothing to do with Singapore . For this reason , Karthigesu J. found section 37 ( 1 ) to be unconstitutional since the nexus between the classification and section 37 ( 1 ) ' s objective was not reasonable enough to justify derogating from Article 12 ( 1 ) . The High Court 's decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal , which held that the under-inclusiveness was not fatal because of the \" overriding need to observe international comity \" . In any case , \" [ t ] he enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency . Such a demand would be legislatively impractical , if not impossible . \" The over-inclusiveness of section 37 ( 1 ) was deemed irrelevant to the constitutional issue because the provision applied equally to all Singapore citizens . = = = = Applications of the rational nexus test = = = = The rational nexus test was applied in Mohamed Emran bin Mohamed Ali v. Public Prosecutor ( 2008 ) , in which the High Court was faced with the issue of whether the failure to prosecute drug enforcement authorities in an entrapment case amounted to discrimination against the persons eventually charged with drug trafficking . The Court found that there was a \" perfectly rational nexus between entrapment operations and the socially desirable and laudable objective of containing the drug trade \" as convicting state agents who carried out covert operations would result in illicit drug suppliers prospering and flourishing while enforcement agencies would \" wither and perish \" . Further , the exercise of the Attorney-General 's prosecutorial discretion was an executive act which satisfied the rational nexus test and was therefore not in contravention of Article 12 of the Constitution . In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor ( 2010 ) , the Court of Appeal had to determine the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes . In that case , the differentiating factor was found in the Misuse of Drugs Act ( \" MDA \" ) , which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than 15 grams ( 0.53 oz ) of diamorphine ( heroin ) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction . Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor ( 2005 ) , which had applied Ong Ah Chuan , the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA . The Court also noted that the \" quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market , but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and , hence , broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender 's crime . \" Although Taw Cheng Kong was not cited in this case , the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in Taw Cheng Kong . = = = = Alternatives to the rational nexus test = = = = In other jurisdictions , courts have applied standards of judicial review more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional . It remains to be seen whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally . = = = = = Three-tiered scrutiny = = = = = In footnote 4 of United States v. Carolene Products Co . ( 1938 ) , Justice Harlan F. Stone opined that where legislation was aimed at \" discrete and insular minorities \" who lack the normal protections of the political process , a more exacting standard of judicial review with no presumption of constitutionality should be applied . At present in the United States there are three different levels of scrutiny . Firstly , if a law categorizes on the basis of race or national origin ( which are regarded as suspect classifications ) , or infringes a fundamental right , strict scrutiny is applied . Accordingly , the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest . In addition , there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest . Secondly , if the law categorizes on the basis of gender , legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications , intermediate scrutiny is applied \u2013 the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest . Finally , the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other , non-suspect , basis . In this case , the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest . In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court of Malaysia referred to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not very different from the traditional rational nexus standard , which it then proceeded to apply . The Court 's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon ( 1990 ) . It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights , and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review . As such , the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia . There are several criticisms of the three-tiered scrutiny analysis , the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being that it does not control judicial discretion : the identification of classifications as suspect , quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests , and political and social interests . = = = = = Test of proportionality = = = = = The test of proportionality in English law , which is applied to determine whether a fundamental right is appropriately restricted by legislation , has three limbs : The legislative objective must be sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right . The measures designed to meet the legislative objective must be rationally connected to it . The means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective . It has been suggested that a proportionality analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three-tiered scrutiny approach . The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test . = = = = = Test of reasonableness = = = = = In Maneka Gandhi , Bhagwati J. appeared to suggest that the rational nexus test should not be applied to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution , which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law , because it led to a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision . He held that Article 14 should not be construed too narrowly as it was the pillar on which the foundation of the Indian Democratic Republic rested . In his view , the principle of reasonableness was an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness , and it pervaded Article 14 \" like a brooding omnipresence \" . A test of reasonableness was applied to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Malaysian Constitution in some cases , but it was later rejected by the Federal Court in Danaharta Urus Sdn . Bhd. v. Kekatong Sdn . Bhd . ( 2004 ) . The Court noted that in cases subsequent to Maneka Gandhi the reasonable classification test had been applied , even by Bhagwati J. himself . Furthermore , equality under Article 8 ( 1 ) does not mean absolute equality , but only assures the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances . The rational nexus test is needed to determine if a law applies equally to all persons in the same group , and is therefore an \" integral part \" of Article 8 ( 1 ) . = = Discriminatory application of laws = = The traditional Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test is inappropriate where the issue is not the existence of discriminatory classification in a statute , but discriminatory application of a neutral statute . This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test as the answer to whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons ( stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test ) will always be in the negative . In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General ( 2009 ) , Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang , delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal , applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test , holding that \" [ t ] he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law \" . Phang J.A. relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1980 ) and Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1990 ) , drawing the following salient points from them : An executive act may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination . Thus , an intentional systematic undervaluation of property would breach Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , though \" something less might perhaps suffice \" . However , absolute equality is not attainable and inequalities arising from \" the application of a reasonable administrative policy \" or \" mere errors of judgement \" are not sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . Inequalities due to \" inadvertence or inefficiency \" need to be on \" a very substantial scale \" to violate the Article . Thio Li-ann has expressed the view that Phang J.A. ' s approach in Eng Foong Ho leaves room for judicial clarification . An important question is whether the \" intentional and arbitrary discrimination \" test , which implies the lack of any rationality , is the sole test for proving that an executive act violates Article 12 , or only one possible test . If it is the only test , then the need to prove the absence of rationality is excessively onerous for the plaintiff to satisfy , compared to the \" reasonable classification \" test . She posits that it is preferable for both the \" intentional and arbitrary discrimination \" test and the \" reasonable classification \" test to apply to executive acts . = = Restrictions on the right to equality and equal protection = = Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . Personal law is the law governing a person 's family matters . In Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v. Fatimah binte Abud bin Talib ( 2009 ) , the High Court identified a number of personal laws , including the Intestate Succession Act which does not apply to Muslims ; and regulations 103 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the Prisons Regulations , which respectively state that Jewish prisoners can claim an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government , and that Muslim prisoners may fast during Ramadan and have their work reduced during this period . A number of private Acts establishing religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions . For instance , a person may only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board , which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments , if he or she is Hindu . Similarly , one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board , which manages gurdwaras ( Sikh temples ) in Singapore , if one professes the Sikh faith . Article 149 ( 1 ) immunizes the Internal Security Act from invalidity due to inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution , including Article 12 . The reference to Article 12 in Article 149 ( 1 ) was enacted by Parliament in 1989 to reverse the effect of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , in which the Court of Appeal expressed the view that sections 8 and 10 of the Act violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . = = Other constitutional provisions = = Article 16 ( 1 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in the administration of public educational institutions ( and , in particular , as regards the admission of students or the payment of fees ) , and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution . This provision is stated to be \" [ w ] ithout prejudice to the generality of Article 12 \" . Article 16 ( 2 ) declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions , but there must not be any discrimination on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws . Article 154 states that all persons who are in the same Government service grade must be treated impartially regardless of their race , subject to the terms and conditions of their employment and to other provisions of the Constitution . The Constitution also establishes a procedure for ensuring that statutes do not contain \" differentiating measures \" , that is , measures which discriminate against any racial or religious community . Most bills that have been passed by Parliament must be scrutinized by a non-elected advisory body called the Presidential Council for Minority Rights ( PCMR ) , which must report to the Speaker of Parliament if it is of the view that any clause in a bill contains a differentiating measure . If the PCMR submits an adverse report , Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval , or decide to present the bill for the President 's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all Members of Parliament . The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in 1970 . = = = Cases = = = Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [ 1978 ] INSC 16 , A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597 , Supreme Court ( India ) .

More , 7 U.S. 159 ( 1805 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear appeals from criminal cases in the circuit courts by writs of error . Relying on the Exceptions Clause , More held that Congress 's enumerated grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress 's power to eliminate all other forms of appellate jurisdiction . The second of forty-one criminal cases heard by the Marshall Court , More ensured that the Court 's criminal jurisprudence would be limited to writs of error from the state ( and later , territorial ) courts , original habeas petitions and writs of error from habeas petitions in the circuit courts , and certificates of division and mandamus from the circuit courts . Congress did not grant the Court jurisdiction to hear writs of error from the circuit courts in criminal cases until 1889 , for capital crimes , and 1891 , for other \" infamous \" crimes . The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts , transferred the trial of crimes to the district courts , and extended the Court 's appellate jurisdiction to all crimes . But , these statutory grants were construed not to permit writs of error filed by the prosecution , as in More . More arose from the same Federalist / Jeffersonian political dispute over the judiciary that gave rise to Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) and Stuart v. Laird ( 1803 ) . Benjamin More , a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia , argued that the repeal of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution . Below , a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More , interpreted the repeal act prospectively , and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office . = = Background = = = = = United States presidential election , 1800 = = = The Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party comprised the First Party System in the United States . Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist John Adams in the 1800 presidential election . Jefferson 's party also took control of Congress in the House and Senate elections . After the elections , the lame duck Federalist administration passed the Judiciary Act of 1801 ( the \" Midnight Judges Act \" ) , creating 16 new circuit judgeships to preside in the circuit courts ( as opposed to the district judges and the Supreme Court justices riding circuit ) . Along with the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 ( the \" Organic Act \" ) , the statutes created many judicial vacancies , and Adams filled nearly all of these judgeships on his last day in office . Marshall , in his dual role as Adams ' Secretary of State , failed to deliver some of these commissions before leaving office . = = = Companion cases = = = Immediately after his inauguration , Jefferson instructed his Secretary of State , James Madison , to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions . Further , an act of March 8 , 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act ( 15 of which had already been filled ) , restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts . Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madison \u2014 concerning a confirmed D.C. justice of the peace who had not received his commission \u2014 as a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal . The next session of the Supreme Court was in June , one month before the repeal would take effect . But , the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court 's next session until February 1803 , and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system . More broadly , Jefferson removed 146 of 316 ( 46 % ) incumbent , second-level , appointed federal officials , including 13 U.S. Attorneys and 18 U.S. Marshals . Jefferson also displaced two district judges \u2014 Ray Greene and Jacob Read \u2014 citing technical flaws in their appointments . Further , District Judge John Pickering was impeached and removed from office on a party-line vote . The following day , the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase , but six Democratic-Republicans crossed party lines in the Senate to prevent his conviction by a single vote . In Marbury , the Supreme Court held that Madison 's failure to deliver the commission to Marbury was illegal , but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus on the ground that \u00a7 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction . Stuart v. Laird \u2014 involving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802 \u2014 challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit . In a brief opinion , the Court rejected both challenges . = = = District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 = = = Both the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and the D.C. justices of the peace were created on February 27 , 1801 by the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 . Unlike its better-known predecessor , the Midnight Judges Act , the Organic Act survived repeal by the Jeffersonian Congress . = = = = D.C. justices of the peace = = = = The D.C. justices of the peace were appointed by the President , in a number at his discretion , and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms . A D.C. justice of the peace had jurisdiction over \" all matters , civil and criminal , and in whatever relates to the conservation of the peace \" within their county . The District of Columbia was divided into two counties : Washington County , east of the Potomac River , and Alexandria County , west of the Potomac . Justices of the peace were authorized to \" inflict whipping , imprisonment , and fine as high as 500 pounds of tobacco \" and to hear civil cases with an amount in controversy up to $ 20 . One year after More , in Ex parte Burford ( 1806 ) , the Marshall Court 's first original habeas case , the Court granted a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner subjected to preventive detention by the D.C. justices of the peace . As to compensation , the Organic Act provided that justices of the peace \" shall be entitled to receive for their services the fees allowed for like services by the laws herein before adopted and continued , in the eastern part of said district . \" A March 3 , 1801 amendment to the Organic Act provided that : \" [ T ] he magistrates , to be appointed for the said district , shall be and they are hereby constituted a board of commissioners within their respective counties , and shall possess and exercise the same powers , perform the same duties , receive the same fees and emoulments , as the levy courts or commissioners of county for the state of Maryland possess , perform and receive . . . . \" On March 4 , 1801 , President John Adams 's last day in office , Adams nominated and the Senate confirmed 20 D.C. justices of the peace for Washington County and 19 for Alexandria County . On March 16 , President Thomas Jefferson issued 15 commissions to justices of the peace in Washington County , including 13 nominated by Adams , and 15 in Alexandria County , including 11 nominated by Adams ; the remainder were of his own choosing . ( Jefferson 's list , submitted to the Senate on January 6 , 1802 , erroneously contained the name of John Laird , a confirmed Adams appointed who had not received a commission from Jefferson , instead of More . ) The plaintiffs in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) \u2014 William Marbury , Dennis Ramsay , Robert Townsend Hooe , and William Harper \u2014 were among the confirmed Adams nominees not commissioned . On May 3 , 1802 , Congress eliminated both the fees for justice of the peace services , except travel expenses , authorized by the Organic Act and fees associated with the justices of the peace 's role on the board of commissioners . These two sources represented the entirety of their compensation . = = = = D.C. circuit court = = = = The three-judge United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia was populated by its own judges , rather than by a mixture of district judges and circuit riding Supreme Court justices like the other circuit courts . The D.C. circuit court had jurisdiction over crimes committed within the district . With regard to appeals from the D.C. circuit court , the Organic Act provided : [ A ] ny final judgment , order or decree in said circuit court , wherein the matter in dispute , exclusive of costs , shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars , may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the supreme court of the United States , by writ of error or appeal , which shall be prosecuted in the same manner , under the same regulations , and the same proceedings shall be had therein , as is or shall be provided in the case of writs of error on judgments , or appeals upon orders or decrees , rendered in the circuit court of the United States . The provision to which the Organic Act referred , that for writs of error from the circuit courts to the Supreme Court in the Judiciary Act of 1789 , provided : And upon a like process [ as a writ of error from the district court to the circuit court ] , may final judgments and decrees in civil actions , and suits in equity in a circuit court , brought there by original process , or removed there from courts of the several States , or removed there by appeal from a district court where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of two thousand dollars , exclusive of costs , be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court , the citation being in such case signed by a judge of such circuit court , or justice of the Supreme Court , and the adverse party having at least thirty days \u2019 notice . Unlike the appellate provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 , the appellate provision of the act of February 27 , 1801 was not explicitly limited to civil cases ( except insofar as it incorporated the former by reference ) . Further , because the D.C. circuit court was not constituted within the framework of the Judiciary Act of 1802 , appeals to the Supreme Court by way of certificates of division could not issue . After More , the Marshall Court heard six appeals from the D.C. circuit court via original habeas . = = = Criminal appeals = = = The availability of criminal appeals to the Supreme Court by means of writs of error from the circuit courts was perhaps an open question prior to More . In England , the writ of error was available as of right in misdemeanor cases , but , in felony cases , required the express consent of the prosecutor . The legislative history of the Judiciary Act of 1789 reveals little consideration of criminal appeals . Caleb Strong , a Senator at the time of its drafting , described \u00a7 22 of that act as follows : \" Writs of Error from the Circuit to the Supr . Court in all Causes not criminal of which the Circuit Court has original Cognizance and the Matter in Dispute does not exceed 2000 Dolrs . \" Senator ( and future Supreme Court justice ) William Paterson noticed the lack of provision for criminal appeals in preliminary notes and a draft outline of a speech he gave on June 23 , 1789 . According to Rossman , Paterson may have viewed the inability of the government to appeal ( to a court in the nation 's capitol ) as a \" protection for ordinary citizens . \" The issue of criminal appeals was not mentioned in the House debates . Shortly after the Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect , Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed , in a report to the House of Representatives , a criminal appeal similar to that in England : a writ of error as of right in non-capital cases , and no writs of error in capital cases . Randolph 's report was referred to the Committee of the Whole , which took no action . Prior to Marshall 's tenure , the Supreme Court had heard only two criminal cases \u2014 both by prerogative writ . First , in United States v. Hamilton ( 1795 ) , the Court granted bail to a capital defendant \u2014 as it was authorized to do by \u00a7 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and \u00a7 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793 . The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court 's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court , as was provided for by \u00a7 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793 . In Ex parte Bollman ( 1807 ) , the Court explained that its jurisdiction in Hamilton could only have been exercised via original habeas under \u00a7 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 . Second , in United States v. Lawrence ( 1795 ) , the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy . In one criminal trial , United States v. Callender ( C.C.D. Va . 1800 ) , Justice Samuel Chase ( who expressed no dissent in More ) wrote : [ I ] f I am not right , it is an error in judgment , and you can state the proceedings on the record so as to show any error , and I shall be the first man to grant you the benefit a new trial by granting you a writ of error in the supreme court . In United States v. Simms ( 1803 ) , the Court heard a writ of error , brought by the United States , on the merits from a criminal case in the D.C. circuit court . Simms was the first such case , and after Simms , the next criminal writ of error heard by the Court was More . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia John T. Mason argued both Simms and More . = = Indictments = = Benjamin More was one of two of D.C. justices of peace in Alexandria County of Jefferson 's own choosing , receiving an interim appointment . Jefferson proceeded to nominate More for a full five-year term , and the Senate confirmed More on April 27 , 1802 . According to O 'Fallon , \" More appears to have been a man of moderate Jeffersonian sentiments and attachments , who nonetheless joined in a Federalist defense of judicial independence . \" He was \" an unlikely character for the lead role in a Federalist attack on Jeffersonian principles . \" O 'Fallon hypothesizes that More 's case was intended as a test case by all parties involved . \" More has all the markings of a trumped-up case , manufactured to present the Supreme Court with the issues of principle raised by the repeal , without the embarrassment of direct conflict with the Executive . \" More was indicted by the Grand Inquest for the County of Washington , during its July term , for taking unlawful fees for his services as a justice of the peace . The indictment charged More with having taken the fees on July 17 and 24 . A capias , returnable at the December 1802 term , was issued . The members of the Inquest included five other D.C. justices of the peace : Daniel Carrol , Daniel Reintzell , Joseph Sprigg Belt , Thomas Corcoran , and Anthony Reintzell . Another member of the Inquest was Thomas Beall , a confirmed Adams appointee who had not received a commission from Jefferson . More was indicted a second time at the December term for conduct on December 10 , 1802 . More demured , and the case was continued until the July 1803 term . Only the latter indictment was mentioned in the United States Reports . More 's demurrer was opposed by U.S. Attorney Mason , a Jefferson appointee . Mason argued that the D.C. justices of the peace were Article I judges established pursuant to Congress 's enumerated power over the District of Columbia in Article One of the United States Constitution . Article One provides that Congress shall have power \" [ t ] o exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) as may , by Cession of particular States , and the Acceptance of Congress , become the Seat of the Government of the United States . \" Mason advanced a broad view that Congress 's power over the District of Columbia was not limited any other constitutional provision . In support of his argument that the justices of the peace were not Article III judges , Mason argued that their jurisdiction was broader than that permitted by Article III . According to O 'Fallon , there were additional indicia \u2014 not cited by either party \u2014 that the justices of the peace were not Article III judges . For example , the Organic Act authorized the President to appoint as many justices of the peace as he \" shall from time to time think expedient . \" This was a broad delegation to the President of Congress 's power \" [ t ] o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court . \" More was not indicted under any criminal statue passed by Congress . Rather , his was \" an indictment at common law . . . for having , under colour of his office , exacted and taken an illegal fee . \" The Organic Act provided that the laws of Maryland and Virginia would continue in force in the portions of the district ceded from those states . Since More was a justice of the peace for Alexandria County , the common law of Virginia would have applied . = = Dismissal = = The D.C. circuit court judges hearing the demurrer were Chief Judge William Kilty and assistant judges William Cranch and James Markham Marshall ( Chief Justice John Marshall 's brother ) . Cranch and Marshall were Adams appointees ; Kilty was a Jefferson appointee . Cranch , also the reporter of decisions for the Supreme Court , included the D.C. circuit court opinions in the margin of his report of the Supreme Court 's decision in More . = = = Majority = = = Cranch , joined by Marshall , sustained More 's demurrer based on the Compensation Clause of Article Three of the United States Constitution . That clause provides : \" The Judges , both of the supreme and inferior Courts . . . shall , at stated Times , receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office . \" Cranch held that Congress 's power over the federal district was limited by the remainder of the Constitution . In response to Mason 's argument for unfettered power , Cranch replied : \" [ T ] his is a doctrine to which I can never assent . Can it be said , that congress may pass a bill of attainder for the district of Columbia ? That congress may pass laws ex post facto in the district , or order soldiers to be quartered upon us in a time of peace , or make our ports free ports of entry , or lay duties upon our exports , or take away the right of trial by jury , in criminal prosecutions ? \" Cranch held that More was an Article III judge sitting on a \" Tribunal inferior to the supreme Court . \" In response to the argument that his jurisdiction exceeded Article Three , Cranch replied that : \" The causes of which they have cognizance , are causes arising under the laws of the United States , and , therefore , the power of trying them , is part of the judicial power . . . . \" In response to the argument that the fees would never have been paid at a \" time Stated , \" Cranch replied that : \" [ I ] t may , perhaps , be a compliance with the clause of the constitution , which requires that it shall be receivable at stated times , to say that it shall be paid when the service is rendered . And , we are rather to incline to this construction , than to suppose the command of the constitution to have been disobeyed . \" Further , Cranch dodged the question of whether a five-year term was consistent with the Good Behavior Clause . \" It is unnecessary in this cause to decide the question , whether , as such , he holds his office during good behaviour . . . . \" Cranch stopped short of declaring the statute unconstitutional . He merely interpreted it as prospective , holding that it \" cannot affect that justice of the peace during his continuance in office ; whatever effect it may have upon those justices who have been appointed to office since the passing of the act . \" Contemporary media accounts reported that the circuit court had held that fee-elimination provision of the May 23 , 1802 act unconstitutional , rather than interpreting it as prospective . According to O 'Fallon , this is evidence that Cranch 's published opinion ( as reported by himself ) may have differed from his oral opinion . = = = Dissent = = = Chief Judge Kilty 's dissent noted the recent confirmation of the principle of judicial review in Marbury v. Madison . \" According to the course which has been pursued by the supreme court , it appears unnecessary to say any thing about the power of a court to examine into the constitutionality of a law . . . . \" Instead , Kilty proceeded by \" taking the power for granted . \" But , Kilty noted , \" [ i ] n testing an act of the legislature by the constitution , nothing less than the positive provisions of the latter can be resorted to . . . . \" Kilty briefly argued that More was not an Article III judge and that the fees in question were not compensation received at \" times Stated . \" But , the bulk of Kilty 's dissent was devoted to the argument that Congress 's power over the federal district was broad . He argued that \" the district of Columbia , though belonging to the United States , and within their compass , is not , like a state , a component part , and that the provisions of the constitution , which are applicable particularly to the relative situation of the United States and the several states , are not applicable to this district . \" \" [ W ] hen congress , in exercising exclusive legislation over this territory , enact laws to give or to take away the fees of the justices of the peace , such laws cannot be tested by a provision in the constitution , evidently applicable to the judicial power of the whole United States , and containing restrictions which cannot , in their nature , affect the situation of the justices , or the nature of the compensation . \" Yet , Kilty did not fully accept Mason 's argument that Congress 's power over the district was unlimited . He argued that the word \" exclusive \" meant only \" free from the power exercised by the several states \" and that \" the legislative power to be exercised by congress may still be subject to the general restraints contained in the constitution . \" He admitted that , even within the federal district , Congress was restrained from suspending the writ of habeas corpus , unless in the cases allowed ; from passing ( within and for the district ) a bill of attainder , or ex post facto law ; from laying therein a capitation tax ; from granting therein any title of nobility ; from making therein a law respecting the establishment of religion , or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; and from quartering soldiers therein , contrary to the third amendment . = = Oral argument = = Mason argued the appeal of the United States before the Supreme Court . Samuel Jones argued for More . = = = Merits = = = Jones cited Marbury v. Madison for the proposition that a D.C. justice of the peace does not serve merely at the pleasure of the president . According to O 'Fallon , due to the President 's power to remove most appointees from office , this could only have been a reference to the Good Behavior Clause of Article Three . That clause provides that \" Judges , both of the supreme and inferior Courts , shall hold their Offices during good Behavior . \" Mason countered that Marbury only held that justices of the peace were entitled to hold their offices for five years of good behavior . Mason again pressed his argument that Congress 's power of the federal district was unlimited : The constitution does not apply to this case . The constitution is a compact between the people of the United States in their individual capacity , and the states in their political capacity . Unfortunately for the citizens of Columbia , they are not in either of these capacities . . . . Congress are under no controul in legislating for the district of Columbia . Their power , in this respect , is unlimited . Marson also argued that More was not an Article III judge because \" the judicial power exercised in the district of Columbia , extends to other cases [ than those enumerated in Article III ] , and , therefore , is not the judicial power of the United States . \" \" It is a power derived from the power given to congress to legislate exclusively in all cases whatsoever over the district . \" = = = Jurisdiction = = = On February 13 , sua sponte , Chief Justice Marshall raised his doubts to the Court 's jurisdiction to entertain criminal appeals . Argument on this question commenced on February 22 . Mason argued in favor of jurisdiction . No argument from More 's counsel on this issue was reported , \" although it was typical for the reporter to summarize the arguments on both sides . \" Mason acknowledged that , under Clarke v. Bazadone ( 1803 ) , the Supreme Court 's appellate jurisdiction required an affirmative grant by Congress . Mason argued that such a grant was found in \u00a7 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 ( known as the All Writs Act ) , which authorized the Supreme Court to \" issue writs of scire facias , habeas corpus , and all other writs , not specially provided for by statute , which may be necessary for the exercise of [ its ] jurisdiction , and agreeable to the principles and usages of law . \" Mason 's argument based on the All Writs Act was not necessarily limited to the D.C. circuit court . Said Mason : There is no reason why the writ of error should be confined to civil cases . A man 's life , his liberty , and his good name , are as dear to him as his property ; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other . There is nothing in the nature of the cases which should make a difference ; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case . They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings . Chief Justice Marshall replied that , if Congress had made no provision for appeals of any kind to the Supreme Court , \" your argument would be irresistible . \" But , Marshall countered , under the Exceptions Clause , when Congress \" has said in what cases a writ of error or appeal shall lie , an exception of all other cases is implied . \" The Exceptions Clause provides that \" [ i ] n all [ cases other than those in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction ] , the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction , both as to Law and Fact , with such Exceptions , and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make . \" Mason replied , first , that the Exceptions Clause did not apply to the federal district , and second , that Organic Act differed from the Judiciary Act of 1789 by referring to \" any final judgment , order , or decree , \" rather than explicitly limiting appeals to \" civil cases . \" Mason suggested that the references to the amount in controversy could refer to criminal fines as well as civil judgments . Finally , Mason pointed out that , just two years earlier , in United States v. Simms ( 1803 ) , the Court had reached the merits in a criminal appeal from the same court . Mason himself had argued Simms , and Marshall himself had authored the opinion . In response to the last point , Marshall replied that : \" No question was made , in that case , as to the jurisdiction . It passed sub silentio , and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case . \" Mason retorted : \" But the traverser [ Simms ] had able counsel , who did not think proper to make the objection . \" = = Opinion = = On March 2 , 1805 , writing for a unanimous Court , Chief Justice John Marshall dismissed the writ of error for want of jurisdiction . Justice Johnson was absent from the opinion announcement . Marshall held that the partial statutory grant of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress 's power under the Exceptions Clause to limit the jurisdiction of the Court in all other cases . Marshall noted that \" it has never been supposed , that a decision of a circuit court could be reviewed , unless the matter in dispute should exceed the value of 2,000 dollars . \" Thus , Marshall interpreted the $ 2000 amount in controversy requirement of \u00a7 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applying to the entire section , rather than only the last antecedent . Marshall rejected the argument that the Organic Act authorized criminal appellate jurisdiction . He interpreted the grant , in light of its $ 100 amount in controversy requirement , as \" confined to civil cases . \" \" The words , ' matter in dispute , ' seem appropriated to civil cases , where the subject in contest has a value beyond the sum mentioned in the act . But , in criminal cases , the question is the guilt or innocence of the accused . And although he may be fined upwards of 100 dollars , yet that is , in the eye of the law , a punishment for the offence committed , and not the particular object of the suit . \" A final footnote refers to United States v. La Vengeance ( 1796 ) , \" where it seems to be admitted , that in criminal cases the judgment of the inferior court is final . \" La Vengeance was an admiralty libel case . There , at oral argument , Attorney General Charles Lee argued , in the alternative , that the case was a \" criminal cause \" and therefore \" should never have been removed to the Circuit Court , the judgment of the District Court being final in criminal causes . \" The Court summarilly rejected Lee 's argument : \" we are unanimously of opinion , that it is a civil cause : It is a process of the nature of a libel in rem ; and does not , in any degree , touch the persons of the offender . \" = = Aftermath = = After More , no writs of error issued from federal criminal trials in the circuit courts for 84 years . In 1889 , Congress created a right of appeal by writ of error in capital cases . In 1891 , the Judiciary Act of 1891 ( the \" Evarts Act \" ) extended this right to other serious crimes . The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts and placed original jurisdiction for the trial of all federal crimes in the district courts . Appeal to the courts of appeals by writs of error was provided for all \" final decisions , \" in civil and criminal cases alike . Appeals to the Supreme Court were permitted directly from the district courts by writ of error , from the courts of appeals on certified questions , and by petition for certiorari . Without reported discussion of the jurisdictional issue , the Court did hear writs of error from criminal cases removed to the circuit courts . ( Recall that the Judiciary Act of 1789 explicitly authorized appeals in removal cases . ) The Supreme Court had other , limited sources of appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases . The Court could hear criminal appeals from the state courts by writ of error , as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789 . The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division , as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802 , original habeas petition , as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789 , and mandamus , as authorized by the same act . Between 1867 and 1868 , and after 1885 , the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions ( a civil action ) in the circuit courts . Beginning in 1850 , the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts . Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful . = = Analysis = = More had received far less scholarly attention than Marbury . \" The timing and the ground of decision may explain why historians of the battle over repeal have ignored More . \" \" In a doctrinal summary of constitutional law , More stands only for the proposition that an affirmative grant of appellate jurisdiction by Congress carries with it an implicit negative of jurisdiction within the constitutional description but not mentioned in the grant . \" According to O 'Fallon , \" More may have been part of a Federalist strategy to get the Court to intervene in the political struggle over the judiciary . \" Given that Justice Samuel Chase was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment case on March 1 , 1805 , the day before the release of the More decision , \" [ o ] ne can imagine John Marshall passing a sigh of relief as he handed down the judgment in More . \" \" [ T ] he dismissal of More marked the end of Federalist efforts to obtain a Supreme Court ruling , directly or by implication , that the repeal of the 1801 Judiciary Act was unconstitutional . \" More is of a piece with Marbury and Stuart v. Laird in its avoidance of an opportunity for an open clash with political critics of the courts . It further shares with Marbury the characteristic of declining an exercise of jurisdiction that the Court found to be unwarranted . \" O 'Fallon argues : Rather than seize the opportunity presented by More , John Marshall ducked . . . . Without questioning the soundness or propriety of Marshall 's decision , it is worth noting that the Court had previously entertained criminal appeals from the district without raising any such jurisdictional problem . One might reasonably wonder if the Court wanted to avoid a decision on the merits . By March of 1805 , the repeal question had lost its political immediacy , and the impeachment strategy of the Jeffersonians had faltered . There was little to be gained in reopening the sores of the repeal battle . And Marshall may have felt that he had had his say on the critical matters of principle with his opinion in Marbury .",

The Crimes Act was a \" comprehensive statute defining an impressive variety of federal crimes . \" As an enactment of the First Congress , the Crimes Act is often regarded as a quasi-constitutional text . The punishment of treason , piracy , counterfeiting , as well as crimes committed on the high seas or against the law of nations , followed from relatively explicit constitutional authority . The creation of crimes within areas under exclusive federal jurisdiction followed from the plenary power of Congress over the \" Seat of the Government , \" federal enclaves , and federal territories . The creation of crimes involving the integrity of the judicial process derived from Congress 's authority to establish such courts . The Crimes Act also established a statute of limitations for federal crimes , provided for criminal venue , ensured procedural protections for treason and capital defendants , simplified the pleading requirements for perjury , and broadened the constitutional protection against \" corruption of blood . \" Further , the act provided for punitive dissection of murderers and codified diplomatic immunity . = = Background = = Even after the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789 , \" the definition of crimes and the establishment of punishments \" remained a \" missing link of the criminal system . \" The Judiciary Act of 1789 divided original jurisdiction for the trial of federal crimes between the district courts and the circuit courts . The district courts were given jurisdiction over all federal crimes \" where no other punishment than whipping , not exceeding thirty stripes , a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars , or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months , is to be inflicted . \" The circuit courts were given concurrent jurisdiction over these crimes , and exclusive jurisdiction over all other federal crimes . The circuit courts also exercised appellate jurisdiction over the district courts , but only in civil cases . The Judiciary Act of 1789 also placed the responsibility for prosecuting federal crimes in the United States Attorney for each federal judicial district . The Act provided that \" there shall be appointed in each district \" a \" person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States in such district , who shall be sworn or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office , whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences , cognizable under the authority of the United States . \" Prior to the Crimes Act , Congress had passed very few federal crimes . Among Congress 's earlier criminal statutes were : The renewal of the Northwest Ordinance , which authorized the executive to adopt state law within the Northwest Territory ; and A prohibition on unloading ships in the dark or without a license , as well as customs bribery and false statements ; and A prohibition on census takers failing to report their findings . = = Drafting = = The Senate passed an act to define a variety of federal crimes on August 31 , 1789 , but the House did not act on that bill . Like the Judiciary Act of 1789 and the Process Act of 1789 , the Crimes Act was primarily authored by Senator ( and future Chief Justice ) Oliver Ellsworth as the chair of the Senate committee . The committee examined the state criminal laws of Massachusetts , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and South Carolina at the beginning of the drafting process . The Crimes Act generated \" little reported debate \" on the floor of Congress . The act was passed on April 30 , 1790 . = = Crimes established = = Due to the seriousness of the authorized sentences , under the Judiciary Act of 1789 , original jurisdiction for the trial of all of the crimes created by the Crimes Act would have rested with the circuit courts ; none of the crimes created could have been tried in the district courts . = = = Treason = = = Article Three provides that : \" Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying War against them , or in adhering to their Enemies , giving them Aid and Comfort . No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act , or on Confession in open Court . The Congress shall have power to declare the Punishment of Treason , but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood , or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted . \" As to misprision of treason , according to David P. Currie , because \" [ t ] he Constitution said nothing of this offense , \" \" the legislators must have interpreted the narrow definition of treason in Article III not to preclude it from creating lesser related offenses that might otherwise fall within federal purview \u2014 although nothing in the misprision provision suggested that Congress had yet considered the possible impact of the Treason Clause on its efforts to punish seditious expression . \" = = = Piracy and the high seas = = = Article One provides that Congress shall have the power \" [ t ] o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas . \" Five sections in the Crimes Act \" were devoted to the subject . \" Currie notes that the various piracy offenses \" take an exceedingly broad view of what constituted piracy , \" but that \" [ f ] rom a constitutional standpoint no harm was done , since all of the acts punished were felonious and Congress 's power extended to all felonies on the high seas . \" \" The principal provisions with respect to piracy were incorporated in section 8 . \" Section 8 applied not only to the \" high Seas , \" but also to \" any river , haven , basin , or bay , out of the jurisdiction of any particular State . \" Currie notes a variety of constitutional theories which Congress might have espoused in order to justify this provision : \" Whether Congress thought authority over such places included within the ostensibly narrower term ' high Seas , \" necessary and proper to the regulation of commerce or to the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction , or implicit in a central government responsible for external affairs is not clear . \" Currie also argues that the phrase \" offence , which , if committed within the body of a county , would , by laws of the United States , be punishable with death \" is vague . He suggests that it could refer to any federal law , to any state or federal law , or only to federal laws applicable to places under exclusive federal jurisdiction . = = = Counterfeiting = = = Article One provides that Congress shall have the power \" [ t ] o provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States . \" Currie argues that section 14 's somewhat broad reading of the word \" Securities \" is fair enough . Currie suggests that \" [ n ] othing was said of counterfeiting coins \" because the United States Mint had not yet been established . Some members of the House , including Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts , spoke against the prescribing death penalty for counterfeiting , viewing it as too harsh . = = = Crimes against the law of nations = = = Article One provides that Congress shall have the power \" [ t ] o define and punish . . . Offenses against the Law of Nations . \" According to Currie : \" No reliance on inherent on implied powers over foreign affairs was necessary to justify \" sections 26 and 28 as each \" plausibly described \" offenses against the law of nations . Congress had also created a civil offense against the law of nations in the Alien Tort Statute of the Judiciary Act of 1789 . = = = Exclusive federal jurisdiction = = = Several offenses were limited to acts committed in places \" under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States . \" Such regulations would have applied in the \" Seat of the Government , \" federal enclaves , and federal territories . Article One provides that Congress shall have the power \" [ t ] o exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) as may , by Cession of particular States , and the acceptance of Congress , become the Seat of the Government of the United States , and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be , for the Erection of Forts , Magazines , Arsenals , dock-Yards , and other needful Buildings . \" And Article Four provides that \" Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory . . . . \" With reference to the \" arms , ordnance , munition , shot , powder , or habiliments of war belonging to the United States \" provision of section 16 , Currie argues that it could have been justified under Congress 's Article One power to \" raise and support armies \" or Congress 's Article Four power to make needful rules respecting \" property belonging to the United States . \" In United States v. Bevans ( 1818 ) , although the defendant had only been charged under \u00a7 8 of the Crimes Act , Chief Justice Marshall proceeded to consider whether the offense would have been cognizable under \u00a7 3 . Following the canon of noscitur a sociis , Marshall interpreted the jurisdictional phrase \" any fort , arsenal , dockyard , magazine , or in any other place , or district of country \" to be limited to places that are \" fixed and territorial \" ( i.e. not to include a navy vessel ) . Crimes against persons Crimes against property Misprision = = = Integrity of the judicial process = = = The constitutional authorization of these crimes was less explicit , but Article One does provide that Congress shall have the power \" [ t ] o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court . \" According to Currie : This is the point at which explicit constitutional authority for the creation of federal crimes runs out . But the statute went on to define additional crimes : theft or falsification of court records , perjury , bribery of federal judges , interference with judicial process , and liberation of federal prisoners . All of these were plainly necessary and proper to the operation of the federal courts ; Marshall was to cite the perjury section as precedent for the existence of implicit powers in M 'Culloch v. Maryland . According to Stacy and Dayton , these provision are \" compelling evidence that the founders did not intend the national role in criminal law to be limited to crimes expressly mentioned in the Constitution . \" = = Criminal procedure = = = = = Statute of limitations = = = Section 32 provided for the following statutes of limitations : no statute of limitations for wilfull murder or forgery ; no statute of limitations for fugitives from justice ; three ( 3 ) years for capital offenses ( other than wilfull murder and forgery ) ; two ( 2 ) years for non-capital offenses . In United States v. Cook ( 1872 ) , the Court held that indictments need not plead facts establishing that these limitations periods have not run . = = = Venue = = = Section 8 provided that \" the trial of crimes committed on the high seas , or in any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular State , shall be in the district where the offender is apprehended , or into which he may first be brought . \" Thus , section 8 was an exercise of Congress 's authority under Article Three to define criminal venue for all crimes \" not committed within any State . \" But , the Supreme Court did not interpret section 8 as exercising the full extent of Congress 's authority under Article Three . In Ex parte Bollman ( 1807 ) , the Court held that the statutory term \" any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state \" applied only to \" any river , haven , bason or bay , not within the jurisdiction of any particular state , \" and only in \" those cases there is no court which has particular cognizance of the crime . \" = = = Treason and capital cases = = = The Crimes Act prescribed death as the exclusive punishment for the crimes of treason , counterfeiting , wilfull murder , and aiding the escape of a death row prisoner , as well as piracy , murder , and robbery on the high seas . Section 29 provided treason and capital defendants a right to a copy of the indictment , a list of the jury ( and , in treason cases , witnesses ) , appointed counsel , and compulsory process : [ A ] ny person who shall be accused and indicted of treason , shall have a copy of the indictment , and a list of the jury and witnesses , to be produced on the trial for proving the said indictment , mentioning the names and places of abode of such witnesses and jurors , delivered unto him at least three entire days before he shall be tried for the same ; and in other capital offences , shall have such copy of the indictment and list of the jury two entire days at least before the trial : And that every person so accused and indicted for any of the crimes aforesaid , shall also be allowed and admitted to make his full defence by counsel learned in the law ; and the court before whom such person shall be tried , or some judge thereof , shall , and they are hereby authorized and required immediately upon his request to assign to such person such counsel , not exceeding two , as such person shall desire , to whom such counsel shall have free at all reasonable hours ; and every such person or persons accused or indicted of the crimes aforesaid , shall be allowed and admitted in his said defence to make any proof that he or they can produce , by lawful witness or witnesses , and shall have the like process of the court where he or they shall be tried , to compel his or their witnesses to appear at his or their trial , as is usually granted to compel witnesses to appear on the prosecution against them . Most of the provisions of section 29 are plainly similar to those of the Sixth Amendment , namely the Information Clause , the Assistance of Counsel Clause , and the Compulsory Process Clause . The Sixth Amendment ( and the remainder of the Bill of Rights ) had not yet been ratified at the time of the Crimes Act 's passage . Section 30 provided treason and capital defendants with peremptory challenges and provided for a plea of not guilty in the case that the defendant refused to enter a plea : if any person or persons be indicted of treason against the United States , and shall stand mute or refuse to plead , or shall challenge peremptorily above the number of thirty-five of the jury ; or if any person or persons be indicted of other of the offences herein for which the punishment is declared to be death , if he or they shall also stand mute or will not answer to the indictment , or challenge peremptorily above the number of twenty persons of the jury ; the court , in any of the cases aforesaid , shall notwithstanding proceed to the trial of the person or persons so standing mute or challenging , as if he or they had pleaded not guilty , and render judgment thereon accordingly . In United States v. Shackleford ( 1855 ) , the Court held that the section 30 's allocation of peremptory challenges controlled , rather than an 1840 statute that required federal jury selection to generally follow state law ( and , thus , the prosecutor was given no peremptory challenges in such cases ) . Ten years later , Congress abrogated Shackleford , granting prosecutors five peremptory challenges in treason and capital cases ( and two in non-capital felony cases ) ; the 1865 act left the defendant 's number of peremptory challenges unchanged . Section 31 eliminated the benefit of clergy for capital crimes . Section 33 designated the means of execution as \" hanging . . . by the neck until dead . \" = = = Perjury indictments = = = Section 19 , applicable to perjury prosecutions under section 18 , provided that in every presentment or indictment to be prosecuted against any person for wilful and corrupt perjury , it shall be sufficient to set forth the substance of the offence charged upon the defendant , and by what court , or before whom the oath or affirmation was taken , ( averring such court , or person or persons to have a competent authority to administer the same ) together with the proper averment or averments to falsify the matter or matters wherein the perjury or perjuries is or are assigned ; without setting forth the bill , answer , information , indictment , declaration , or any part of any record or proceeding , either in law or equity , other than as aforesaid , and without setting forth the commission or authority of the court , or person or persons before whom the perjury was committed . and section 20 provided that in every presentment or indictment for subornation of perjury , or for corrupt bargaining or contracting with others to commit wilful and corrupt perjury , it shall be sufficient to set forth the substance of the offence charged upon the defendant , without setting forth the bill , answer , information , indictment , declaration , or any part of any record or proceeding , either in law or equity , and without setting forth the commmsion or authority of the court , or person or persons before whom the perjttry was committed , or was agreed or promised to be committed . = = = Sentencing = = = Section 24 provided that \" no conviction or judgment of any of the offences aforesaid , shall work corruption of blood , or any forfeiture of estate . \" This generalized the guarantee of Article Three that \" no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood , or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted . \" The Crimes Act made no provision for the creation of federal prisons . Instead , a September 21 , 1789 concurrent resolution asked the state legislatures to authorize their prisons to imprison federal prisoners . The first federal prison was not opened until 1894 at Fort Leavenworth . = = Other provisions = = = = = Dissection = = = Section 4 authorized a court to order the post-execution dissection of the corpse of convicted murderers . According to David P. Currie , this was the \" most controversial provision of the entire statute . \" Dissection-as-punishment had its roots in a 1789 New York statute and a 1752 English law . Rep. Michael J. Stone of Maryland argued against the inclusion of this provision as cruel . Currie argues that Congress was on a firm constitutional footing in enacting this provision in relation to murders committed in areas under exclusive federal jurisdiction , but perhaps less so for murders committed on the high seas . = = = Diplomatic immunity = = = Section 25 provided : [ I ] f any writ or process shall at any time hereafter be sued forth or prosecuted by any person or persons , in any of the courts of the United States , or in any of the courts of a particular state , or by any judge or justice therein respectively , whereby the person of any ambassador or other public minister of any foreign prince or state , authorized and received as such by the President of the United States , or any domestic or domestic servant of any much ambassador or other public minister , may be arrested or imprisoned , or his or their goods or chattels be distrained , seized or attached , such writ or process shall be deemed and adjudged to be utterly null and void to all intents , construction and purposes whatsoever . Section 27 provided a limited exception for private debts contracted by ambassadors prior to the passage of the act . = = Prosecutions = = Between 1790 and 1797 , only 147 criminal cases were brought in the circuit courts , and more than half of those cases were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning the Whiskey Rebellion . And , between 1790 and 1801 , only 426 criminal cases were brought in all federal courts ( the district courts and the circuit courts combined ) . = = Amendments and repeals = = Section 1 was supplemented by an omnibus treason law during the Civil War , which , inter alia , provided for punishments other than death and additional lesser offenses . The offense of treason , and the punishment thereof , were codified in consecutive sections of the Revised Statutes . Both were repealed and replaced by the Criminal Code of 1909 . During the 1948 re-codification of the Criminal Code , the treason offense was amended and moved to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2381 , where it remains . It was amended in 1994 . Section 2 was codified in the Revised Statutes , and re-codified by the Criminal Code of 1909 , and the 1948 re-codification . It was amended in 1994 . Section 3 was amended by \u00a7 4 of the Crimes Act of 1825 and codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 4 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 5 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 6 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 7 was amended in 1857 and 1875 and codified in the Revised States . Section 8 was amended in 1820 , 1835 , and 1846 and codified in five sections of the Revised Statutes . Further , \u00a7 8 was supplemented by additional prohibitions in \u00a7 5 of an 1819 act and \u00a7 3 of an 1820 act . Despite the similarity of the provisions , all three were all separately codified in the Revised Statutes in 1874 . Section 8 was repealed by the Criminal Code of 1909 . Section 8 's venue provision was re-enacted by \u00a7 14 of the Crimes Act of 1825 , with minor changes . Section 9 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 10 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 11 was codified in two sections of the Revised Statutes . Section 12 was amended in 1835 and codified in two sections of the Revised Statutes . Section 13 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 14 was repealed by \u00a7 17 of the Crimes Act of 1825 , which broadened the offense of counterfeiting and reduced authorized the punishment from death to 10 years hard labor and a $ 5000 fine . Sections 18 through 21 of the 1825 Act created additional counterfeiting offenses . Section 15 was amended in 1874 and codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 16 was amended in 1842 and codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 17 was amended by \u00a7 8 of the Crimes Act of 1825 and codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 18 was amended by \u00a7 13 of the Crimes Act of 1825 \u2014 which defined the term \" perjury \" and increased the authorized punishment to 5 years hard labor and a $ 3000 fine \u2014 and further amended in 1874 and 1876 . Perjury and subornation were separately codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 19 was codified in three sections of the Revised Statutes . Section 21 was codified in two sections of the Revised Statutes . Section 22 was amended in 1866 and codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 23 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 24 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Sections 25 through 29 were not codified in Title LXX of the Revised Statutes . Section 30 , with regard to peremptory challenges , was re-enacted and supplemented in 1865 . Section 30 , with regard to a defendant 's failure to enter a plea , was extended from capital to all crimes by \u00a7 14 of the Crimes Act of 1825 . Section 31 was codified in the Revised Statutes . Section 33 was codified in the Revised Statutes . = = Constitutionality = = According to Taylor : \" Like the Judiciary Act of 1789 , the Process Act of 1789 and the Crimes Act of 1790 , having been passed by the First Congress , are perhaps the statutes most informative of an original understanding of Congress 's constitutional power over the federal judiciary . \" According to Kurland , \" for the most part , Congress enacted statutes that closely tracked the specific constitutional grants of federal criminal authority . However , Congress continued to venture slightly , but significantly , into areas outside the specific constitutional grants . \" As examples in the later category , Kurland cites the provisions concerning the integrity of the federal criminal process , bribery , misprison of treason , and the revenue provisions . Currie notes that the Crimes Act \" resolved a number of interesting constitutional questions . \" For example , with reference to the punishments of \" stripes \" and disqualification from office , Currie argues that : \" These provisions suggest not only that Congress viewed neither of these punishments as cruel and unusual , but also that they did not understand impeachment to be the sole avenue for the future disqualification of current officeholders . \" Taylor goes further in arguing the disqualification provision was not merely prospective : \" The Crimes Act of 1790 indicates that , beyond its plenary power over federal court jurisdiction and procedure , the First Congress believed it had the constitutional power to make conviction by a court an alternative means of removing a federal judge , outside the impeachment context , and it sheds light on the First Congress 's understanding of its own powers to discipline federal judges . \" Similarly , the Supreme Court and individual justices have cited the Crimes Act 's authorization of the death penalty as evidence that the founders believed it was constitutional .",

                    "text": "Internal Security Act ( Singapore ) = The Internal Security Act ( ISA ) of Singapore ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) is a statute that grants the executive power to enforce preventive detention , prevent subversion , suppress organized violence against persons and property , and do other things incidental to the internal security of Singapore . The present Act was originally enacted by the Parliament of Malaysia as the Internal Security Act 1960 ( No. 18 of 1960 ) , and extended to Singapore on 16 September 1963 when Singapore was a state of the Federation of Malaysia . Before a person can be detained under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs , the President must be satisfied that such detention is necessary for the purposes of national security or public order . In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President 's satisfaction . Two months after the decision , a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision . These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1989 \u2013 1990 ) , which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA . Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists , including members of the socialist opposition party , the Barisan Sosialis . Chia Thye Poh , an alleged Communist , was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998 . The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA . The ISA also empowers the authorities to prohibit political and quasi-military organizations , ban subversive documents and publications , shut down entertainments and exhibitions that are or are likely to be detrimental to the national interest , and to suppress organized violence by declaring parts of Singapore to be security areas . = = History and developments = = British colonial Malaya introduced the Emergency Regulations Ordinance 1948 on 7 July 1948 during the Malayan Emergency in response to a Communist uprising and guerrilla war . The regulations allowed the police to arrest anybody suspected of having acted or being likely to act in a way that would threaten security without evidence or a warrant , hold them incommunicado for investigation , and detain them indefinitely without the detainee ever being charged with a crime or tried in a court of law . The successor to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance , the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance 1955 ( \" PPSO \" ) , was introduced a result of the 1955 Hock Lee bus riots by the Labour Party government in Singapore . There was strong opposition to the PPSO by the party then in opposition , the People 's Action Party ( \" PAP \" ) . In 1958 , Lee Kuan Yew of the PAP accused the Lim Yew Hock government of using the PPSO to stifle political dissent . In 1960 , three years after Malaya 's independence , the Emergency was declared over . However , the Malayan Internal Security Act 1960 ( \" ISA \" ) was passed in place of the PPSO with much of the same powers . During parliamentary debates on the Act , Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman stated that the ISA would only be applied against only the remaining Communist insurgents . The Malayan Communist Party and its insurgents eventually surrendered in 1989 . Nonetheless , the ISA was retained in Malaysia . The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling , a British lawyer , author and professor . In 1989 , he commented that he \" could not imagine then that the time would come when the power of detention , carefully and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution , would be used against political opponents , welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent , peaceful activities \" . Nonetheless , he commented that he supported review of the ISA but it was not for him to say if the law should be scrapped , as \" you 've got a multi-racial society [ in Malaysia ] in which emotions can run high very quickly \" . When Singapore joined the Federation of Malaya in 1963 , the Malayan ISA was extended to Singapore . The Act was retained in Singapore even after its separation from Malaysia in 1965 . The current version of the Act is known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition . In September 2011 , the debate over whether the ISA should be retained was re-opened after Malaysia announced that it was considering repealing the ISA . Prime Minister Najib Razak stated that the Act would be abolished and replaced by new laws to safeguard peace and order . The legitimacy and relevance of the ISA were subsequently debated by former ISA detainees , the Singapore Government , and others . Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris \u2013 Punggol Group Representation Constituency , Dr. Janil Puthucheary , commented in Parliament on 18 August 2011 that \" while he felt it inappropriate to detain a citizen without trial , he is convinced by the hard logic that the safety and security of Singapore must be paramount \" . However , he agreed that there needed to be more safeguards to prevent abuse of the ISA and that \" the ISA needs to be discussed in a more transparent manner , even as the facts associated with a given detainee need to be kept secret \" . The following day , 19 October 2011 , Deputy Prime Minister , Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean explained the relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention . He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations . For the past two decades , though , preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore 's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism . Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat , as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge . Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm . In addition , the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence . Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court . What is more , disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering . However , if confidential information were withheld from the court , a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements , which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused . Finally , court proceedings may stall investigations as part of a broader network , and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved . Opposition political parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished . In its manifesto for the 2011 general election , the Workers ' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws , which allow arrests and detention without trial only under strict conditions , should be enacted to replace the ISA . The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013 . = = Legislative authority for enactment = = The legislative authority for the enactment of the ISA is Article 149 of the Constitution of Singapore , which appears in Part XII ( \" Special Powers against Subversion and Emergency Powers \" ) . Entitled \" Legislation against subversion \" , Article 149 states : ( 1 ) If an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons , whether inside or outside Singapore \u2014 ( a ) to cause , or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear , organised violence against persons or property ; ( b ) to excite disaffection against the President or the Government ; ( c ) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or other classes of the population likely to cause violence ; ( d ) to procure the alteration , otherwise than by lawful means , of anything by law established ; or ( e ) which is prejudicial to the security of Singapore , any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action or any amendment to that law or any provision in any law enacted under clause ( 3 ) is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with Article 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 or 14 , or would , apart from this Article , be outside the legislative power of Parliament . ( 2 ) A law containing such a recital as is mentioned in clause ( 1 ) shall , if not sooner repealed , cease to have effect if a resolution is passed by Parliament annulling such law , but without prejudice to anything previously done by virtue thereof or to the power of Parliament to make a new law under this Article . ( 3 ) If , in respect of any proceedings whether instituted before or after 27th January 1989 , any question arises in any court as to the validity of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by any law referred to in this Article , such question shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of any law as may be enacted by Parliament for this purpose ; and nothing in Article 93 shall invalidate any law enacted pursuant to this clause . To satisfy the requirements of Article 149 ( 1 ) , the preamble to the Malaysian ISA , which has been retained in Singapore 's ISA , contains the following recital : Whereas action has been taken by a substantial body of persons to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear organised violence against persons and property : And Whereas action has been taken and threatened by a substantial body of persons which is prejudicial to the security of Malaya : And Whereas Parliament considers if necessary to stop or prevent that action : Now therefore pursuant to Article 149 of the Constitution be it enacted by the Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong with the advice and consent of the Dewan Negara and Dewan Ra 'ayat in Parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows ... = = Provisions relating to internal security = = Part II of the ISA , the first substantive part of the Act , contains provisions relating to internal security . It is divided into six chapters : I. Prohibition of organisations and associations of a political or quasi-military character and uniforms , etc . II . Powers of preventive detention . III . Special powers relating to subversive publications , etc . IV . Control of entertainments and exhibitions . V. Other powers for the prevention of subversion . VI . Miscellaneous . = = = Prohibition of political or quasi-military organizations = = = Chapter I of Part II of the ISA empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to take action against political or quasi-military organizations and associations . It is a criminal offence to be a member or adherent of any association of persons who are organized , trained or equipped to enable them to be employed \" in usurping the functions of the police or of the Singapore Armed Forces \" or \" for the purpose of enabling them to be employed for the use or display of physical force in promoting any political or other object , or in such a manner as to arouse reasonable apprehension that they are organised or trained or equipped for that purpose \" . It is a more serious crime to promote or conspire with someone else to promote , or to participate in the control or management of , the association , or to organize or train any member or adherent of the association . The Minister is empowered to prohibit any uniform or dress to be worn in public by members or adherents of a political or quasi-military association involved in the activities mentioned in the previous paragraph , or any uniform or dress indicating an association with a political organization or with the promotion of a political object . Wearing such a uniform or dress in contravention of the Minister 's order is an offence . In addition , if the Minister considers it to be in the national interest to do , he may prohibit the \" manufacture , sale , use , wearing , display or possession of any flag , banner , badge , emblem , device , uniform or distinctive dress or any part thereof \" . Currently , the only emblem or device that is prohibited is one \" in the form of a 5-pointed red star or a hammer and sickle in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that the emblem or device was intended or was likely to be used in a manner prejudicial to the interests of Singapore or to promote or foster a purpose prejudicial to or incompatible with peace , welfare or good order in Singapore \" . It is a crime for a person to be present at or to attend any meeting or assembly organized for the participants to train or drill themselves or to be trained or drilled \" in the use of arms ... or for the purpose of practising military exercises , movements or evolutions \" . It is also a crime to train or drill other people in these manners or to take part in the control or management of an association whose members are so trained . The prohibition does not apply to members of the Singapore Armed Forces , the police , a legally constituted volunteer or local force , a visiting force lawfully present in the country , or any organization or association exempted by the Minister . = = = Preventive detention = = = Chapter II of Part II of the ISA , which allows for preventive detention ( also known as detention without trial ) , is the most conspicuous feature of the Act . It confers on the executive a discretionary power to arrest and detain without trial , when necessary , a person with a view to prevent \" that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any part thereof or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein \" . For the purposes of this provision , essential services means services relating to water , electricity , public health , fire , prisons , post , telephony , telegraphy , radiocommunication ( including broadcasting and television ) , ports , docks , harbours , public transport , and the bulk distribution of fuel and lubricants . Instead of detaining a person for the purposes mentioned above , the executive may impose other restrictions upon the person 's liberty such as curfews , requiring the reporting of his or her movements , prohibiting the person from speaking at public meetings or taking part in political activities , and travelling beyond Singapore or any part of the country . = = = = Procedure = = = = = = = = = Before detention = = = = = Before a person can be detained under the ISA , the President must be satisfied that such detention is necessary for the purposes of national security or public order . This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the detention . The detention order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8 . = = = = = Initial detention = = = = = Once an individual has been detained , there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9 , 11 and 12 of the Act . The detainee is to be informed of the grounds of detention as soon as possible , unless their disclosure is against the national interest . He or she is to be served with a copy of the detention order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the detention order was made . The detainee is also to be informed within 14 days of his or her right to make representations against the order to an advisory board , which is required to hear and consider the detainee 's representations . Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President , and has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice . The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses , and to order that documents be produced . It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention . When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister 's decision , the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released . Before exercising his discretion , the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers . Non-citizens detained under the ISA do not have a right to make representations to an advisory board . They may , within two months from the date of the detention order , make written representations to the Minister . The Minister may , but is not bound to , refer the representations to an advisory board . Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court . The burden of proving that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one , and again the Minister 's decision on the matter is final . = = = = = Extension and suspension of detention = = = = = The initial order of the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an individual be detained for up to two years . This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time . The Minister is empowered with discretion to suspend a detention order , but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time , which reactivates the detention order . Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister . If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees , the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release . The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens . When a detention order is extended , the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension . = = = = Scope of judicial review of ISA orders = = = = Under administrative law , judicial review is an exercise in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive 's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law . If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles , the Court can invalidate them . Similarly , if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution , the Court has a duty to declare it invalid . With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial , the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990 . These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively . During that period , the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments . = = = = = Before 1988 : Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs = = = = = Prior to 1988 , the Singapore case of Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1971 ) was authority for the application of the subjective discretion test for judicial review of executive power exercised under the ISA . The subjective test precludes the court from inquiring into the facts and grounds that are relied upon by the executive body in exercising its discretion . It is based on the literal interpretation of the words \" [ i ] f the President is satisfied \" that appear in section 8 of the ISA , such that no more is required than the subjective satisfaction of the President . This reasoning applies similarly to section 10 of the ISA , which requires the Minister 's satisfaction for the suspension of detention orders . = = = = = 1988 \u2013 1989 : Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs = = = = = In the case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal expanded the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion . In contrast to the subjective test , the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker 's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell within the scope of the purposes specified by the ISA . The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient . However , the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case . The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds . The subjective test was rejected for several reasons by the Court of Appeal . It held that applying the subjective test to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional . The word law in Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1980 ) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice . Hence , Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner . If the subjective test were to be adopted , it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention , therefore rendering sections 8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article 12 ( 1 ) . When the case was decided , Article 149 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties , did not cover inconsistencies with Article 12 . Also , the Court noted that adopting the objective test would be consistent with Article 93 of the Constitution , which vests judicial power in the courts . It did not , however , directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test , in conferring arbitrary powers of detention , would be inconsistent with Article 93 . Further , the Court rejected the subjective test on the basis that \" the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law \" . The rule of law requires the courts to examine the exercise of discretionary power and ensure that executive power is exercised within its legal limits . The Court of Appeal also held that legal precedents from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported a rejection of the subjective test in favour of the objective test . The subjective test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson ( 1941 ) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs ( 1941 ) . However , these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords . These courts had rejected the subjective test applied by the majority in Liversidge , preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment . In the light of these developments , the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri ( Minister for Home Affairs ) , Malaysia ( 1969 ) , which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents ' counsel had relied on in support of the subjective test , could no longer be considered good law . Additionally , Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor ( 1978 ) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia , was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test . The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act , which the ISA of Singapore is derived from . Although sections 8 and 10 of the ISA concern matters of national security , the Court held that this concern does not preclude the objective review of executive discretion . Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( 1983 ) , the Court of Appeal decided that it is up to the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security . Similarly , it should also be within the court 's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections 8 and 10 . = = = = = 1989 amendments and Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs = = = = = Parliament subsequently passed the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 and the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 . They took effect on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively . Section 8B ( 1 ) of the amended ISA provides that the law pertaining to the judicial review of decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position applicable in Singapore on 13 July 1971 , the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided . In Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1990 ) , the Court of Appeal held that these amendments reinstated the legal position set out in Lee Mau Seng as the applicable law governing judicial review in Singapore , thus prompting a return to the subjective test in reviewing the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA . The possible inconsistencies the subjective test had with respect to Articles 12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved with the passing of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 . Article 149 ( 1 ) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles 11 and 12 . This was in addition to Articles 9 , 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article 149 ( 1 ) before the amendment . Furthermore , a new Article 149 ( 3 ) provided that nothing in Article 93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article 149 . Hence , the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed , and the subjective test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore . The Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 also introduced section 8B ( 2 ) , which is an ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA . In Teo Soh Lung , the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary for it to decide if the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case . Hence , the position remains to be confirmed by the courts . In addition , the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the effect of section 8B ( 2 ) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA . Parliament also introduced into the ISA section 8D , which dictates that the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 is to be applied retrospectively to proceedings instituted \" before or after \" 30 January 1989 . Article 11 ( 1 ) of the Constitution states : \" No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made , and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed . \" Though the 1989 amendments to the ISA did not retrospectively introduce any criminal offences , the legislature saw fit to amend Article 149 ( 1 ) by inserting a reference to Article 11 to forestall any possible arguments on section 8D 's inconsistency with the Article . As the Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said in Parliament : \" The reference to Article 11 is necessary to ensure the retrospective application of the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Bill is not challenged . \" The test for judicial review on matters not relating to the ISA remains the objective test . In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1992 ) , the High Court held that validity of detention under the Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions ) Act is not dependent on the Minister 's subjective satisfaction . Rather , the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated with criminal activities . = = = = Academic views = = = = = = = = = Mala fides situations = = = = = While the current law in Singapore holds that the Home Affairs Minister 's decision is subjective and not judicially reviewable , there is uncertainty whether there are exceptional situations in which the courts may still step in to practice judicial review even though the ISA deals with national security matters . A possible exception is when the Minister 's decision was made mala fides , that is , in bad faith . Such decisions would involve the clear abuse of power , such as being \" detained solely for having red hair or for failing a professional examination or for having acted as a lawyer against the Government \" . However , the law on this issue is presently unclear . In Lee Mau Seng , the High Court said that mala fides was not a justiciable issue in relation to the ISA . A similar stance was taken in Malaysia in Karam Singh . However , in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal said that it did not need to decide whether Lee Mau Seng has precluded judicial review in mala fides situations until a case with a mala fides factual situation arises . Furthermore , there is an increasing number of Malaysian cases reflecting \" a gradual recognition that ... indicate a retreat from the purely subjective approach \" . In response to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng , academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it . One is that the definition of mala fides used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually unreasonableness and not mala fides in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith . In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly ( 1977 ) , Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is \" dishonesty \" and \" always involves a grave charge \" . This contrasts with the meaning of mala fides in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness . Thus , an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts . = = = = = Freezing of the common law = = = = = After the 1989 amendments to the Constitution and the ISA , there was academic discourse on the effect of section 8B ( 1 ) on the future development of the common law . The amendments merely caused a time warp in the common law , taking it back to 1971 . As they did not amount to a codifying or declaratory Act seeking to replace the common law of judicial review , there is uncertainty whether the courts may continue to develop the common law and move away from the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng . Michael Rutter has asserted that the common law can indeed continue to change . While the Parliament has the power to turn the clock back , \" the Parliament is powerless to stop the clock from running \" and \" as soon as the clock is placed back in the hands of the judiciary , the hands might race forward again \" . Such a stance has wide implications : the High Court and Court of Appeal would not be bound by Lee Mau Seng . They could rule that situations involving mala fides are judicially reviewable , or completely re-adopt the legal position stated in Chng Suan Tze . The justification is that \" if Parliament intended to render judiciary law impossible , it has only to issue its laws in a more detailed shape , so that in the vast complexity of human affairs there may always be at hand a rule sufficiently precise and definite to meet each particular case \" . = = = = = Validity of ouster clause = = = = = Another issue that has undergone academic scrutiny is the nature of section 8B ( 2 ) as an ouster clause . An ouster clause is an objectively worded provision which is drafted to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts . In Teo Soh Lung , the Court of Appeal declined to address the constitutionality of section 8B and , in particular , how section 8B ( 2 ) should be interpreted . Michael Hor has described the judiciary 's reluctance to address these points as \" an elegant piece of judicial ' kung fu ' \" in which it chose to evade the problem . In a lecture to law students in 2010 , Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong commented that , in general , \" ouster clauses may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Constitution , which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the Supreme Court \" , though he expressed no concluded opinion on the matter . However , it seems unlikely that Article 93 can be relied on to invalidate section 8B ( 2 ) since Parliament specifically enacted Article 149 ( 3 ) to protect the 1989 amendments to the ISA from inconsistency with Article 93 . Tham Chee Ho has opined that where a jurisdictional error of law is involved , judicial review will be available despite the presence of an ouster clause . However , an ouster clause still precludes judicial review of non-jurisdictional errors of law . If this distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law exists , section 8B ( 2 ) will preclude judicial review of non-jurisdictional errors of law but not jurisdictional errors . Notably , there is a difference between English and Singapore law as regards this issue . In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council , ex parte Page ( 1992 ) , Lord Browne-Wilkinson commented that the case of Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission ( 1968 ) had the effect of rendering the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law obsolete . This has limited the effect of ouster clauses in the United Kingdom since all errors of law are considered as jurisdictional . However , the Singapore courts have not yet adopted this legal position , and there are cases indicating that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law still exists . = = = = = Basic features doctrine = = = = = The basic features doctrine developed in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala ( 1973 ) and Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India ( 1980 ) by the Supreme Court of India rests on the notion that there are certain elements of the nation 's constitutional structure which cannot be amended by Parliament . In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1989 ) , the plaintiff argued that the 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power , and contravening the rule of law . The Court rejected the application of the basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution , and the fact that the framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament 's power of amendment . The Court also held that , in any case , there had been no violation of the Constitution 's basic features on the facts of the case . On appeal , the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds , and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore . = = = = = Role of the judiciary in national security matters = = = = = There are competing views over the appropriate role of the judiciary in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA . A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters . The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit the role of the courts in national security matters . In 1989 , Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were needed because the courts would effectively be responsible for national security matters if judicial review was permitted . The subjective test was deemed necessary to reserve to the executive the responsibility for national security matters , and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats . Tham Chee Ho contends that , based on the objective test set out in Chng Suan Tze , the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced . This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes , but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues . The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment . Another reason that was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the judiciary was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues . Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly , hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial . By its nature , however , preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing . Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped to determine whether there are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action . Tham agrees with this view , but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power . He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar , since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved . Thio Li-ann has opined that the 1989 measures taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate a preference for non-legal institutional checks . One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees ' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated . Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review . She contends that since Article 149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties , meaningful restraints should be placed on the wide discretionary powers under the ISA . Similarly , in Chng Suan Tze , the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive 's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power . Eunice Chua argues against adopting the subjective test and limiting judicial review to breaches of the procedures stated in the ISA . Her argument is based on the premise that courts should consider notions of substantive democracy in performing their judicial role . Chua argues that in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal should have considered whether there were sufficient safeguards for the protection of detainees after the curtailment of judicial review through constitutional and legislative amendments . She suggests that Article 151 , which provides for restrictions on preventive detention , should be read liberally in favour of detainees , bearing in mind the exclusion of fundamental liberties by Article 149 . In her view , the curtailment of judicial review should therefore be rejected , as it does not accord with the \" spirit \" of Article 151 of the Constitution which ensures safeguards for detainees . Conversely , Jayakumar argued in 1989 that judicial review is an inappropriate safeguard in preventing abuse of the detention powers under the ISA in the situation where a dishonest government is in power . He argued that judicial safeguards are illusory because such a dishonest government would \" pack the courts \" and appoint judges which would rule in their favour . He regarded the best safeguard to be for voters to elect honest and incorruptible men into the Government . = = = = Criticisms of preventive detention = = = = In 2006 , the United States Department of State noted that although the ISA had not been used against the Singapore Government 's political opponents for some years , \" political opposition and criticism remained restricted by the government 's authority to define these powers broadly . In the past , occasional government references to speech that it considered ' out-of-bounds ' were understood to be implicit threats to invoke the ISA . \" The Singapore Government itself has regularly raised the need to prevent national security threats from materializing as a justification for preventive detention . However , there have been suggestions that the criminal law is apt for dealing with this matter as well . Crimes of accessory liability such as abetment , conspiracy and unlawful assembly in the Penal Code may apply even if harm has not actualized . Furthermore , restrictions imposed by the Societies Act , as well as the offences in the Sedition Act , may be viable alternatives to preventive detention . Preventive detention has been preferred over open court trials , as it has been suggested that the criminal trial could be used as a platform for radicals to publicize their views , and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons . However , it has been suggested that an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country . Under the framework of the ISA , detainees are theoretically accorded due process . For instance , detainees have a right to make representations against their detention to an advisory board . However , Article 151 ( 3 ) of the Constitution prevents any government authority from disclosing any information which would , \" in its own opinion , be against national interest \" . Therefore , there is no means to compel the authorities to disclose information which may be pertinent for the detainee to make a proper representation to an advisory board , thus compromising due process . Moreover , the secrecy of advisory board hearings has been criticized as it may lead to the public questioning the legitimacy of the hearings , and to an impression that justice has not manifestly been done . Due to the limited form of judicial review available under the ISA , whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs . This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes ? \u2013 who guards the guardians ? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately in a manner that cripples lawful democratic opposition , the absence of judicial review would preclude the exposure of such abuse . It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose . = = = = Instances of the application of the PPSO and ISA = = = = According to The Sunday Times of 28 October 1956 , 234 people , including trade union leaders Lim Chin Siong , James Puthucheary and C. V. Devan Nair , were detained under the PPSO as suspected Communist subversives . On 2 February 1963 Operation Coldstore , a joint Malaysian \u2013 Singaporean anti-Communist operation , led to the arrest of 133 people . As of 5 April 1963 , 17 were being detained in the Federation of Malaya and 107 in Singapore , while the remaining nine had been released . On 30 October 1966 , Chia Thye Poh , leader of the leftist Barisan Sosialis political party , was detained . He was subsequently held for 32 years pursuant to the ISA , the last nine of which under forms of house arrest and civil rights restrictions , including confinement on the island of Sentosa . All such restrictions were finally lifted on 27 November 1998 . As of that date , the South China Morning Post referred to him as \" the world 's second longest serving prisoner-of-conscience after South Africa 's Nelson Mandela \" . The Straits Times of 28 May 1976 reported that 50 people allegedly involved in a Communist plot had been arrested . Among them were the playwright and theatre director Kuo Pao Kun , then a secretary for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce , and his wife Goh Lay Kuan . Kuo was detained under the ISA for four years and seven months , and his citizenship was revoked . Following his release he was placed under residence and travel restrictions until 1983 . His citizenship was reinstated in 1992 . In 1987 , in a security operation known as Operation Spectrum , 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals were detained under the ISA . They were accused of being members of a dangerous Marxist conspiracy bent on subverting the government by force and replacing it with a Marxist state . The detentions led to , among others , the Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases . Two people were arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities . Of those arrested in 1997 , one was a male permanent resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service who had used the other person , a female Singaporean , as a collaborator . Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency . One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization . All the detainees were subsequently released . From 2001 , the ISA was mainly used against al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists in Singapore . In December that year , 15 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) militant group were arrested for involvement in the Singapore embassies attack plot . JI member Mohamed Khalim bin Jaffar was detained in January 2002 ( and later released in September 2011 ) , and another 21 members were arrested and detained in August 2002 . In February 2006 , alleged JI head Mas Selamat bin Kastari was extradited from Indonesia and detained under the ISA . He escaped from custody on 27 February 2008 and was only rearrested by the Malaysian authorities on 1 April 2009 . He was transferred back to Singapore for detention under the ISA on 24 September 2010 . Between November 2006 and April 2007 , four Singaporean JI members were detained under the ISA while one had a restriction order issued against him . In addition , lawyer and lecturer Abdul Basheer s / o Abdul Kader , who radicalized himself by reading extremist propaganda on the Internet , was detained in February 2007 for preparing to engage in militant activities in Afghanistan . He was released on 21 February 2010 , but rearrested in September 2012 and detained under the ISA the following month for planning to resume jihadist terrorism against foreign military operations abroad , including leaving Singapore \u2013 illegally , if necessary \u2013 to do so . Full-time National Serviceman Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid was detained on 4 April 2010 . He was described by the media as self-radicalized , having been deeply influenced by the lectures of Feiz Mohammad and Anwar al-Aulaqi which he had accessed online . Around this time , two other people influenced by al-Aulaqi were placed under restriction orders . Between January and July 2011 , three Muslim radicals were deported to Singapore from other countries and detained . JI members Jumari bin Kamdi and Samad bin Subari were arrested in Malaysia and Indonesia respectively ; while Abdul Majid s / o Kunji Mohammad , a member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , was arrested in Malaysia . As of 13 September 2011 , there were 17 people on orders of detention , one whose detention had been suspended , and 49 people on restriction orders . On 7 March 2013 , it was mentioned in Parliament that 64 people had been detained under the ISA for activities related to terrorism since 2002 . In September 2013 , the Singapore media reported that Asyrani Hussaini had been detained in March that year and was the fifth Singaporean to have been influenced by radical ideology he had read online . Asyrani had entered Thailand illegally to take part in the armed insurgency in Southern Thailand , but was arrested and deported to Singapore . Another Singaporean , Mustafa Kamal Mohammad , was placed on a two-year restriction order from September 2013 for being a member of the MILF in the Philippines . Three Singaporean former JI members had their restriction orders lifted ; they were Jahpar Osman and Samad Subari , and Abdul Majid Kunji Mohamad who had trained with the MILF . = = = Subversive documents = = = Under Chapter III of Part II of the ISA , the minister responsible for printing presses and publications \u2013 currently the Minister for Communications and Information \u2013 is authorized to ban documents and publications that are subversive or otherwise undesirable . For instance , the Minister may prohibit ( absolutely or conditionally ) the printing , publication , sale , issue , circulation or possession of a document or publication that : ( a ) contains any incitement to violence ; ( b ) counsels disobedience to the law or to any lawful order ; ( c ) is calculated or likely to lead to a breach of the peace , or to promote feelings of hostility between different races or classes of the population ; or ( d ) is prejudicial to the national interest , public order or security of Singapore ... Such a prohibition order can extend to any past or future issue of a periodical publication , and to other publications which have been issued or appear to have been issued by the publishing house , agency or other source which issued the prohibited publication . The proprietor of a prohibited publication can lodge an objection to a prohibition order within a month of the date when the order is published in the Government Gazette to the President , whose decision on the matter is \" final and shall not be called in question in any court \" . When exercising this discretion , the President is required to follow the advice of the Cabinet . It is a criminal offence to print , publish , sell , issue , circulate , reproduce or possess a prohibited publication or an extract from it ; and to import , abet the importation of , or have in one 's possession any imported prohibited publication . There is a rebuttable presumption a person knows the contents of a publication and their nature immediately after the publication comes into his or her possession . However , it is a defence for a person to demonstrate that the publication was \" printed , published , sold , issued , circulated or reproduced , as the case may be , without his authority , consent and knowledge , and without any want of due care or caution on his part , and that he did not know and had no reason to suspect the nature of the document or publication \" . Among the publications that have been interdicted under the Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong , and the Russian political newspaper Pravda . A crime is committed if any person posts or distributes a placard , circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence , counsels disobedience to the law or a lawful order , or is likely to lead to a breach of the peace . Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally , in writing , or in any newspaper , periodical , book , circular or other printed publication is also an offence . Finally , it is an offence to carry or have in one 's possession or under one 's control a subversive document . A document is deemed to be subversive if , in whole or in part , it has a tendency : ( a ) to excite organised violence against persons or property in Singapore ; ( b ) to support , propagate or advocate any act prejudicial to the security of Singapore or the maintenance or restoration of public order therein or inciting to violence therein or counselling disobedience to the law thereof or to any lawful order therein ; or ( c ) to invite , request or demand support for or on account of any collection , subscription , contribution or donation , whether in money or in kind , for the direct or indirect benefit or use of persons who intend to act or are about to act , or have acted , in a manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or to the maintenance of public order therein , or who incite to violence therein or counsel disobedience to the law thereof or any lawful order therein . A document that purports to be a subversive document is presumed to be one until the contrary has been proved , and if it is proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document , he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature . Nevertheless , a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents and the nature of the contents of the document , and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive . The ISA places a duty on any person , any office-bearer of an association , or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay . Failure to do so without police authorization , or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence . = = = Control of entertainments and exhibitions = = = The Home Affairs Minister may , under Chapter IV of Part II of the ISA , order that any entertainment or exhibition be closed if satisfied if it \" is or is likely to be in any way detrimental to the national interest \" . Entertainment is defined by the Act as \" any game , sport , diversion , concert or amusement of any kind to which the public has or is intended to have access and in which members of the public may or may not take part , whether on payment or otherwise \" , while exhibition \" includes every display of goods , books , pictures , films or articles to which the public has or is intended to have access , whether on payment or otherwise \" . It is an offence to be the promoter of or a person concerned in the promotion of an entertainment or exhibition held or continued in contravention of an order requiring it to be closed , or the proprietor of the premises on which such an event is held . However , it is a defence to show that the event was \" promoted or continued without his authority , consent and knowledge and without any want of due care or caution on his part \" . Alternatively , to ensure that an entertainment or exhibition is not detrimental to the public interest , the Minister can impose conditions relating to the holding of the event on its promoter , every person involved in its promotion , and the proprietor of the premises on which the event is to be held . Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence , unless the person involved is able to show he or she was not responsible for the breach and exercised due care and caution . The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition , or kept open in contravention of an order by the Minister . To enable the Minister to determine whether an entertainment or exhibition should be banned or allowed to be held subject to conditions , the Minister can require that its promoter , any person involved in its promotion , or the proprietor of the premises on which it is to be held to provide information on the following matters : ( a ) particulars of persons concerned in the promotion of the entertainment or exhibition and the interests represented by those persons ; ( b ) particulars of the persons who have agreed to participate or participated in the entertainment or exhibition or have been invited to do so and the interests represented by those persons ; ( c ) the purposes to which any profits from the entertainment or exhibition are intended to be or have been applied ; and ( d ) such other matters as the Minister may direct . Furnishing false or incomplete information is an offence , and also entitles the Minister to prohibit an event from being held or direct it to be closed . The person providing the information also commits a crime if the event is held in a manner contrary to the information provided . = = = Other powers = = = Chapter VI of Part II of the ISA confers additional powers on the Minister for Home Affairs to prevent subversion . If a written law confers power on a person , body or authority to appoint people to positions , the Minister can order that he or she be provided with a list of the people from which the appointment will be made , and other information . The Minister can then direct that people whose appointment would be prejudicial to the interests of Singapore shall not be appointed or recruited . Furthermore , no person is permitted to disclose any communication received from the Minister except in the course of official duty . The Minister , if satisfied that a school or educational institution is being used for a purpose detrimental to the interests of Singapore or the public , for instruction that is detrimental to the interests of the public or pupils , or as a meeting-place of an unlawful society , can order that it be closed for a period not exceeding six months at a time . The board of managers or governors of an affected school or educational institution can lodge an objection against an order with the President , whose decision on the matter is final and may not be questioned in any court . The Minister 's power does not extend to places where the teaching \" is of a purely religious character , or for a purely religious purpose \" . A person who requires a certificate of suitability for admission to an institution of higher education must apply to the Director of Education , who must not issue a certificate if \" there appear to him to be reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant , if admitted to the institution in question , would be likely to promote , or otherwise participate in , action prejudicial to the interests or security of Singapore or any part thereof \" . A person who does not hold a certificate of suitability may not be admitted to an institution of higher learning as a student . A person who has been refused a certificate may appeal to the Home Affairs Minister , whose decision on the matter is final and cannot be called into question in any court . The Minister can forbid pupils , students , teachers or members ; any class of pupils , students , teachers or members ; or any named pupil , student , teacher or member of any school , college , educational institution or students ' union or association situated or established outside Singapore to enter into or travel within Singapore as a group unless they first obtain permission from the police to do so . An individual pupil , student , teacher or member can also be barred from Singapore if he or she intends to carry out within the country some common object of the group to which he or she belongs . The police can grant permission for such travel subject to conditions . If there is a reason for the Commissioner of Police to believe that any person : ( i ) is a pupil , student , teacher or member affected by an order made under subsection ( 1 ) [ that is , an order by the Minister that the person must obtain police permission to travel to Singapore ] ; ( ii ) has entered Singapore from a place outside and has not since the date of such entry continuously remained in Singapore for a period exceeding 3 months ; ( iii ) is not the holder of a valid identity card issued to him in Singapore in accordance with the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to identity cards and which bears an address within Singapore ; and ( iv ) has contravened or intends to contravene the provisions of any such order ; ... or any person has breached any conditions imposed , the Commissioner can require that the person leave Singapore within a certain time and remain abroad for six months or a lesser period ; or take the person into custody and remove him or her from Singapore , whereupon the person must remain out of Singapore for six months . Failure to comply with any order by the Minister or a breach of the conditions of any permission to travel to Singapore is an offence . The above provisions do not authorize the removal from Singapore of any citizen of Singapore ordinarily resident in the country . = = Provisions relating to security areas = = Part III of the ISA deals with security areas . Section 48 , which is the only provision in Chapter I of Part III , empowers the President , acting on the Cabinet 's advice , to proclaim any area in Singapore a security area if in his opinion public security in the area \" is seriously disturbed or threatened by reason of any action taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons , whether inside or outside Singapore , to cause or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear organised violence against persons or property \" and \" he considers it to be necessary for the purpose of suppressing such organised violence \" . A proclamation of a security area must be published by the Home Affairs Minister in any way that the Minister thinks necessary for bringing it to the notice of all persons who , in the Minister 's view , should have notice of it . It comes into effect once notice has been given , even if it has not yet been published in the Government Gazette . A proclamation remains in force until the President revokes it or Parliament annuls it by passing a resolution . = = = Preservation of public security = = = Chapter II of Part III of the ISA empowers the Minister to take various steps to preserve public security . Within a security area , the Minister may declare areas to be danger areas , controlled areas or protected places . No person is allowed to enter or remain in a danger area unless escorted by a member of a security force , and to enforce this prohibition security forces can take all necessary measures , including those that are \" dangerous or fatal to human life \" . A person who is injured while in a danger area unlawfully cannot make any legal claim for it , though compensation may be awarded if a compensation board thinks it is equitable to do so . The declaration of an area as a controlled area enables the Minister to order that people within the area may only reside within that portion of the area declared to be the \" residential part \" , and that they may not venture beyond the residential part during certain hours . Failure to comply with such orders is a criminal offence . If the Commissioner of Police is of the view that it is \" necessary or expedient in the interests of public security or order , for the maintenance of supplies or services essential to the life of the community , that special precautions should be taken to prevent the entry of unauthorised persons \" , he may declare a place or premises within a security area to be a protected place . While such a declaration is in force , no person is permitted to enter or remain in the place without the permission of the authority or person stated in the declaration . Persons wishing to enter a protected place must submit to being searched by police officers and other authorized persons , and must comply with directions concerning their conduct . A failure to do so can result in their removal from the protected place . It is an offence to be present in a protected place without permission , and to wilfully fail to stop after being challenged by a police officer or unlawfully refuse to submit to a search . The Commissioner of Police can take steps that he considers necessary to secure a protected place , including those that endanger the life of anyone entering the place . If the Commissioner employs such steps , he must take precautions ( including displaying prominent warning notices ) that he considers reasonably necessary to prevent accidental entry into the place . Once such precautions have been put in place , if any person enters the protected place without permission and is injured or killed , he or she is not entitled to receive any compensation or damages . The Minister can declare any fence or barrier surrounding a part of a security area to be a perimeter fence . The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over , through or under the fence , including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life . If the measures are taken in a place other than on , under or within the perimeter fence , the Commissioner must take precautions \u2013 including displaying prominent warning signs \u2013 to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area . If anyone is injured or dies as a result of a defensive measure , no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid . It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross , or pass or attempt to pass any article over , though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point ; and to damage , attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point . In the interests of public safety , the Minister can make a \" clearance order \" concerning land that is within 46 metres ( 151 ft ) of any railway , public road or perimeter fence within a security area , or land in a security area that is \" used for or in connection with the cultivation of rubber , oil palm , gutta-percha , coconut , bananas or any other fruit growing on trees , or any other agricultural or food crops \" . Such an order directs the owner or occupier of the land , their agent , or any person living in the area surrounded by a perimeter fence to clear away \" all herbage , bush and undergrowth and any other object mentioned in the order , other than permanent buildings \" , prevent the undergrowth from growing higher than 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) , and maintain the cleanliness of the land . Failure to comply with a clearance order is a criminal offence . The officer in charge of a police division that forms part of a security area can do the following : Exclusion of persons . Give a written order excluding any person or persons from the police division . Curfew . Impose a curfew on specified persons , designating that they stay indoors or within a particular area between certain hours , unless they obtain a permit to the contrary issued by a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant . Control of roads . Regulate , restrict , control or prohibit the use of a road or waterway by any person or class of persons ; or any vehicle or vessel , or type or description of vehicle or vessel . In addition , can issue permits to regulate , restrict , control or prohibit persons or classes of persons from travelling in any bus , car , train or other vehicle , or in a vessel . A police officer or member of the security forces who is of or above the rating of leading rate or rank of non-commissioned officer and on duty , or a person authorized by the officer in charge of a police division , is empowered to seize any rice or other food if , because of its quantity or situation , it \" is likely to or may become available to any persons who intend or are about to act or have recently acted in a manner prejudicial to public security or to the maintenance of public order \" . In support of this power , people , premises , vehicles and vessels can be searched without a warrant . If it appears to the Minister to be \" necessary or expedient ... in the interests of public security , or for the accommodation of any security forces \" , he or she may take possession of any land or building ( or part of a building ) in a security area . Police officers are permitted to use reasonable force when effecting the taking of possession , and the Minister can require the owner or occupier of the land or building to provide information relating to it . Once the land or building is in the Minister 's possession , he or she has wide power to determine how to use it . The Minister is entitled to disregard any legal restrictions on how it may be utilized , authorize other persons to do with the property anything which the owner or occupier is entitled to do , and ban or limit anyone from exercising rights of way over , and other rights relating to , the land or building . Anyone who feels aggrieved by the Minister taking possession of land or a building can lodge an objection with an advisory committee . The committee is required to consider the objections and any grounds against the objections put forward by the person given possession of the property , and make recommendations to the Minister . The Minister can give \" such directions [ on the recommendations ] as he may think fit \" , and award compensation . If a building or structure in a security area is left unoccupied due to an order relating to the security area , and the officer in charge of the police division in which the building or structure is situated takes the view that it may be used by \" any person or persons who intend , or are about , to act or have recently acted in a manner prejudicial to public security or by any other person who is likely to harbour any such persons \" , and it is not practical to prevent such use , the officer can authorize the destruction of the building or structure . Compensation is payable for such destruction to a person if he or she can demonstrate to the Minister that the building or structure was constructed with the consent of the person lawfully entitled to the land on which it stood , and it was not liable to be forfeited . Even if the building or structure was subject to forfeiture , the Minister can still pay compensation to the owner or occupier if the latter person can prove that it was used by persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public security or for harbouring such persons without his or her knowledge or consent , and that he or she exercised due diligence to ensure that the building would not be used in this manner . = = = Offences = = = Chapter III of Part III of the ISA creates a number of criminal offences relating to security areas . = = = = Firearms , ammunition and explosives = = = = It is an offence to carry , or have in one 's possession or under one 's control in a security area without lawful excuse , any firearm , ammunition or explosive without lawful authority . The penalty for the offence is death . The onus is on the person charged to prove that he or she has a lawful excuse for having the item , and this can only be done by demonstrating that he or she acquired the item in a lawful manner for a lawful purpose , and did not act \" in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order \" while in possession of or having control of it . Furthermore , the person charged has lawful authority to have the item only if he or she : is a police officer , member of the security forces , or person employed in the Prisons Department , and has the item in connection with the performance of his or her duty ; is licensed , or authorized without a licence , to have the item ; or has been granted an exemption by an officer in charge of a police division , or is a member of a class of persons exempted by the Commissioner of Police . However , even if any of the above situations applies to a person , he or she will not be regarded as having lawful authority if he or she has the item for the purpose of using it in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order . In Liew Sai Wah v. Public Prosecutor ( 1968 ) , the appellant was arrested at the Singapore train station for having six grenade bodies in his bag . He was charged and found guilty of possession of ammunition by the High Court , and sentenced to death . The conviction was upheld by the Federal Court of Malaysia ( then part of Singapore 's court hierarchy ) . However , on further appeal to the Privy Council , their Lordships held that grenade bodies did not come within the term ammunition , which was defined as \" ammunition for any fire-arm as hereafter defined and includes grenades , bombs and other like missiles whether capable of use with such a fire-arm or not and any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to contain any noxious liquid , gas or other thing \" . Counsel for the Public Prosecutor suggested that grenade bodies might fall within the definition of explosive , which includes \" any material for making an explosive and any apparatus , machine , implement or material used or intended to be used or adapted for causing or aiding in causing any explosion in or with any explosive , and any part of any such apparatus , machine or implement \" . However , the Privy Council declined to allow this submission as it involved the presentation of a case completely different to the one that the appellant was required to meet during his trial and the appeal before the Federal Court . The appellant was therefore acquitted . It is a crime , while in a security area , to consort with or to be found in the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm , ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above , if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order . The penalty is either death or life imprisonment . It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items . The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years . If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm , ammunition or explosive , there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above . = = = = Supplies = = = = It is an offence for a person , whether inside or outside a security area , to demand , collect or receive supplies from another person under circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that : the first person intends or is about to act , or has recently acted , in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order ; or the supplies are intended for someone who intends or is about to act , or has recently acted in such a manner , or are for a terrorist to use . It is also an offence , inside or outside a security area , to be found in possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for , or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person , in circumstances which raise the reasonable presumption referred to above . The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment . However , in the latter situation , a person will not be convicted if he or she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence . = = = = Other offences = = = = A person inside or outside a security area who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA , or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be a terrorist , but who fails to report the matter to a police officer , commits an offence punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years . However , if the person voluntarily gives full information to a police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence , he or she will not be convicted . It is also an offence to attempt to commit an offence under Part III ; to assist someone that one knows or has reasonable cause to believe has committed an offence to prevent , hinder or interfere with that person 's arrest , trial or punishment ; or generally to contravene or fail to comply with any provision of Part III or any order made , direction given or requirement imposed under Part III , or to abet any contravention or failure by another person . = = Miscellaneous provisions = = The final part of the ISA , Part IV , contains various miscellaneous provisions . Some notable provisions are described in this section . A police officer is entitled to use such force as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances , including lethal weapons : to arrest a person subject to a detention order ; to arrest a person in respect of whom the officer has reason to believe that there are grounds justifying his or her preventive detention , or that he or she has acted or is about to act or is likely to act in a manner prejudicial to national security ; to arrest a person suspected of having committed an offence under the ISA , the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act , or sections 435 or 436 of the Penal Code which criminalize the commission of mischief by fire or an explosive substance to damage property or destroy a building ; to overcome forcible resistance by a person to such an arrest ; or to prevent an arrested person from escaping or being rescued from arrest . A person who has been arrested for any of the offences mentioned above must , as soon as possible after arrest , be \" clearly warned of his liability to be shot at if he endeavours to escape from custody \" . In addition to a police officer , the power to use force can be exercised by a member of the security forces , any guard or watchman in a protected place , and any person authorized by the Commissioner of Police . Provisions exist in the ISA to make it easier to admit statements made by people charged with offences under the Act or certain offences under other laws specified in the Second Schedule to the Act . A statement is admissible in evidence in a trial and , if the person who made the statement chooses to testify during a trial , it may be used in cross-examination and to impeach his or her credit , \" whether the statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing , made at any time , whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions , by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant and whether or not interpreted to him by any other police officer or any other person concerned , or not , in the arrest \" . This is subject to two limitations : A statement is not admissible \" if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement , threat or promise having reference to the charge against that person , proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give that person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him \" . If a statement has been made by a person after being arrested , it is only admissible if the court is satisfied that a caution along the following lines was administered : \" It is my duty to warn you that you are not obliged to say anything or to answer any question , but anything you say , whether in answer to a question or not , may be given in evidence . \" However , if a person makes a statement before there is time to administer a caution , the statement remains admissible if the caution is then administered as soon as possible . Once a person has been cautioned , he or she has a right to remain silent and is not required to answer any questions . = = = Cases = = = Lee Mau Seng v.

                    "text": "Federal prosecution of public corruption in the United States = Several statutes , mostly codified in Title 18 of the United States Code , provide for federal prosecution of public corruption in the United States . Federal prosecutions of public corruption under the Hobbs Act ( enacted 1934 ) , the mail and wire fraud statutes ( enacted 1872 ) , including the honest services fraud provision , the Travel Act ( enacted 1961 ) , and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) ( enacted 1970 ) began in the 1970s . \" Although none of these statutes was enacted in order to prosecute official corruption , each has been interpreted to provide a means to do so . \" The federal official bribery and gratuity statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 ( enacted 1962 ) , the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) ( enacted 1977 ) , and the federal program bribery statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 ( enacted 1984 ) directly address public corruption . The statutes differ in their jurisdictional elements , the mens rea that they require ( for example , a quid pro quo or a nexus ) , the species of official actions that are cognizable , whether or not non-public official defendants can be prosecuted , and in the authorized sentence . The statutes most often used to prosecute public corruption are the Hobbs Act , Travel Act , RICO , the program bribery statute , and mail and wire fraud statutes . These statutes have been upheld as exercises of Congress 's Commerce Clause power , or in the case of the mail fraud and program bribery statutes , the Postal Clause and the Spending Clause , respectively . In the special case where a member of Congress is the defendant , the Speech or Debate Clause places certain restrictions on the actions that can be prosecuted and proved up . Some commentators have argued that prosecutions of state and local officials under these statutes pose substantial federalism questions , while others argue that the Guarantee Clause provides additional authority for such prosecutions . = = History = = Article Two , Section Four of the United States Constitution provides that : \" The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other High crimes and Misdemeanors . \" For a time in the early history of the country , corrupt public officials could be charged with the common law crimes related to corruption ; such crimes could continue to be charged in the D.C. circuit court , where the laws of Maryland and Virginia remained in force , even after the Supreme Court 's decision abolishing federal common law crimes in United States v. Hudson ( 1812 ) . The First Congress passed the \" first federal law against bribery \" in 1789 , which provided that bribed customs officers would be disqualified from office and payors would be liable for the amount of the bribe . The judicial bribery provision of the Crimes Act of 1790 , passed the following year , provided for disqualification , and a fine and imprisonment \" at the discretion of the court , \" for both the judge and the payor . The Crimes Act of 1825 added the offenses of extortion under color of office , theft or embezzlement by a Second Bank employee , and coin embezzlement or dilution by a Mint employee . The mail fraud statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 , \" [ t ] he oldest statute used to address public corruption , \" was enacted in 1872 and first used against public corruption in the 1940s . While several early cases employed the \" intangible right to honest government , \" United States v. States ( 8th Cir . 1973 ) was the first case to rely on honest services fraud as the sole basis for a conviction . The prosecution of state and local political corruption became a \" major federal law enforcement priority \" in the 1970s . United States v. Addonizio ( 3d Cir . 1971 ) and United States v. Kenny ( 3d Cir . 1972 ) \u2014 both brought by U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey , Herbert Jay Stern ( later a federal judge ) \u2014 were the first prosecution of political corruption pursuant to the economic fear prong and the \" under color of official right \" prong of the Hobbs Act , respectively . Henderson describes these cases as the \" New Jersey breakthroughs . \" In 1976 , the Public Integrity Section was established within United States Department of Justice Criminal Division with general supervisory jurisdiction over public corruption offenses . By 1977 , \" [ t ] he four United States attorney 's offices most active in this field \u2014 the Southern District of New York , New Jersey , Maryland , and the Northern District of Illinois \u2014 \" had \" developed coteries of high skilled prosecutors and a tradition of success that encourages an atmosphere of alertness to potential corruption cases . \" In 1977 , Thomas H. Henderson , Jr . , the Chief of the Public Integrity Section , wrote : Until recently , the full panoply of potential federal resources had not been brought to bear effectively on corruption schemes at the state and local level . These schemes are at least as corrosive of the governmental process as corruption at the federal level . From the time of Tammany Hall this country has been painfully aware of the existence of corrupt practices in many of our metropolitan areas , and of the \" machines \" and \" rings \" which siphon off millions of dollars from public treasuries for private gain . Most state and local prosecutors , beset by inadequate resources and the overwhelming demands of a rising rate of street crime , are simply unable to deal with this type of corruption . Moreover , in some cases , local law enforcement is part and parcel of the problem itself , due to the outright corruption of its own establishment . To fill this enforcement role , federal prosecutors during the last decade began to assume a much more active and creative role in attempting to use federal statutes to attack corruption at the state and local level . In 1976 , there were 337 indictments of state and local officials for public corruption , compared to 63 in 1970 . Between 1970 and 1981 , there were 520 federal indictments of state officials , and 1,757 indictments of local officials , for public corruption ; over that period , 369 state officials , and 1,290 local officials , were convicted . In 1986 , there were 916 indictments of public officials for corruption , 320 of which concerned state and local officials . In 1990 , there were 968 such indictments , 353 of which were against state and local officials . The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78dd-1 , was passed in 1977 . The program bribery statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 , was passed in 1984 . In the program bribery statute , \" Congress , for the first time , directly federalized the crime of bribery of or by local officials . \" For example , between 1985 and 1991 , over 75 public officials were convicted of corruption offenses in the Southern District of West Virginia alone . By comparison , the only appellate court decision citing West Virginia 's Bribery and Corrupt Practices Act , in 1991 , was a federal court decision involving the state statute as a federal RICO predicate . And it goes much deeper than that . There have been many cases filed against corruption and other crimes by former agents who commit crimes , as well as attorneys , judges , etc. that can be easily found online , although the option of finding those actual cases continues to diminish even further , in preferential interests of commerce and social media markets taking precedence . Internet searches are becoming intentionally narrowed to restrict citizen 's awareness of such corruption . Stonewalling by both media and law-enforcement in failing to implement the very legislation they create at tax-payer expense , continues unabated in many cases that can be found online . = = Doctrinal overview = = The legal elements and features of the major federal public corruption offenses differ . The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove , alternatively : that the payee was a federal official ; that the payee organization received $ 10,000 in federal funds ; that the corrupt communications involved the use of the mail or interstate wires ; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel . The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo ; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove ; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement . The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official , a violation of an official duty , a fraud on the United States , or an official transaction . The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official . Finally , the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions , and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction . = = Federal officials = = The federal bribery and gratuity statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 , was enacted in 1962 as part of a comprehensive conflict-of-interest legislative reform . The Supreme Court considers subsections ( b ) and ( c ) to be \" to separate crimes \u2014 or two pairs of crimes . \" In Dixson v. United States ( 1984 ) , the Court held that , under the federal bribery and gratuity statute , the definition of a \" public official \" includes anyone in a \" position of public trust with official federal responsibilities , \" including for example the employees of a non-profit that administers a federal block housing grant . The term \" official act \" is limited to acts which are performed within the scope of the official 's employment . It is no defense that the official action was otherwise meritorious . For both the bribery and gratuity subsections , the courts have interpreted an implicit exception for campaign contributions . = = = Bribery = = = The federal bribery statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 ( b ) , criminalizes the corrupt promise or transfer of any thing of value to influence an official act of a federal official , a fraud on the United States , or the commission or omission of any act in violation of the official 's duty . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 ( b ) ( 1 ) \u2013 ( 2 ) provides : ( b ) Whoever \u2013 ( 1 ) directly or indirectly , corruptly gives , offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official , or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity , with intent \u2013 ( A ) to influence any official act ; or ( B ) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing , or collude in , or allow , any fraud , or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud , on the United States ; or ( C ) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person ; ( 2 ) being a public official or person selected to be a public official , directly or indirectly , corruptly demands , seeks , receives , accepts , or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity , in return for : ( A ) being influenced in the performance of any official act ; ( B ) being influenced to commit or aid in committing , or to collude in , or allow , any fraud , or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud , on the United States ; or ( C ) being induced to do or omit to do any act in violation of the official duty of such official or person . . . shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value , whichever is greater , or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years , or both , and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor , trust , or profit under the United States . = = = Gratuity = = = Text The federal gratuity statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 ( c ) , criminalizes the transfer of any thing of value to a federal official for or because of an official act . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 ( c ) ( 1 ) provides : ( c ) Whoever \u2013 ( 1 ) otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty \u2013 ( A ) directly or indirectly gives , offers , or promises anything of value to any public official , former public official , or person selected to be a public official , for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such public official , former public official , or person selected to be a public official ; or ( B ) being a public official , former public official , or person selected to be a public official , otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty , directly or indirectly demands , seeks , receives , accepts , or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such official or person . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than two years , or both . Interpretation In United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California ( 1999 ) , the Supreme Court held that the gratuity statute required a nexus to an official act , but not a quid pro quo . Both past and future official acts are cognizable , but not payments for status , access , generalized goodwill , or unspecified acts . Sun-Diamond defined the nexus as follows : \" We hold that , in order to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , the Government must prove a link between a thing of value conferred upon a public official and a specific ' official act ' for or because of which it was given . \" = = Program bribery = = The program bribery statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 , was enacted in 1984 . Previous prohibitions required the specific funds to have been under federal control ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 ) or the involvement of federal employees ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 ) . Text The program bribery statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 , criminalizes the corrupt offer of anything of value intending to influence an agent in connection with a transaction exceeding $ 5,000 , and involving a government or organization receiving at least $ 10,000 in federal funds . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 ( a ) \u2013 ( c ) provides : ( a ) Whoever , if the circumstance described in subsection ( b ) of this section exists \u2013 ( 1 ) being an agent of an organization , or of a State , local , or Indian tribal government , or any agency thereof . . . ( B ) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person , or accepts or agrees to accept , anything of value from any person , intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business , transaction , or series of transactions of such organization , government , or agency involving any thing of value of $ 5,000 or more ; or ( 2 ) corruptly gives , offers , or agrees to give anything of value to any person , with intent to influence or reward an agent of an organization or of a State , local or Indian tribal government , or any agency thereof , in connection with any business , transaction , or series of transactions of such organization , government , or agency involving anything of value of $ 5,000 or more ; shall be fined under this title , imprisoned not more than 10 years , or both . ( b ) The circumstance referred to in subsection ( a ) of this section is that the organization , government , or agency receives , in any one year period , benefits in excess of $ 10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant , contract , subsidy , loan , guarantee , insurance , or other form of Federal assistance . ( c ) This section does not apply to bona fide salary , wages , fees , or other compensation paid , or expenses paid or reimbursed , in the usual course of business . Interpretation In Fischer v. United States ( 2000 ) , the Court held that the jurisdictional requirement of $ 10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that flow through the organization , for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients . The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation , and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy . Despite academic suggestions to the contrary , in Salinas v. United States ( 1997 ) , the Supreme Court held that the transaction itself need not involve federal funds . The $ 5,000 transactional amount may be satisfied by the value of intangible goods or services . \u00a7 666 does not apply to the corrupt solicitation of political services in exchange for a municipal job . Both \u00a7 666 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and \u00a7 666 ( a ) ( 2 ) contain both an \" intent to influence \" and an \" intent to reward \" prong . Under \" intent to influence \" prong , both a quid pro quo and an actual intent to influence / be influenced are required . Under the \" intent to reward \" prong , the majority of circuits permit prosecutions for mere gratuities , but some do not . Because \" organization \" is defined as non-governmental and \" local government \" is defined as a subdivision of a state , public officials of federal territories cannot be prosecuted under \u00a7 666 . Members of tribal governments may be prosecuted . = = Foreign Corrupt Practices Act = = The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78dd-1 , criminalizes the corrupt offer , by mail or in commerce , of anything of value from a publicly traded company to a foreign official for an official act to do business . = = Mail and wire fraud = = = = = Obtaining money or property = = = Text The federal mail fraud , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 , and federal wire fraud , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 , statutes criminalize any scheme or artifice to obtain money or property by fraud in connection with a mail or wire communication , respectively . The mail fraud statute , \u00a7 1341 provides , in relevant part : Whoever , having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud , or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses , representations , or promises , or to sell , dispose of , loan , exchange , alter , give away , distribute , supply . . . for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do , places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter , any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service , or deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier , or takes or receives therefrom , any such matter or thing , or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or such carrier according to the direction thereon , or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed , any such matter or thing , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years , or both . The wire fraud statute , \u00a7 1343 provides , in relevant part : Whoever , having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud , or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses , representations , or promises , transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire , radio , or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce , any writings , signs , signals , pictures , or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years , or both . Interpretation The mail and wire fraud statutes may be used to prosecute public corruption by both elected and appointed public officials , political party officials , candidates for party offices , members of tribal governments , and others , including foreign public officials . \" The major problems faced by federal prosecutors in applying [ the mail and wire fraud statutes ] to political schemes is establishing that the defendant intentionally attempted to defraud the victims of something of value within the meaning of the States . \" The salary and benefits of an elected public employee are not \" property \" for the purposes of the mail and wire fraud statutes , but the salary and benefits of an unelected public employee are . One intangible form of property recognized under the mail and wire fraud statutes is the right to control the disposition of government funds . In 1983 , Curato et al. noted that : [ F ] ederal courts and prosecutors are now realizing the potential uses for the mail fraud statute in combating political corruption . The relative ease of proving mail fraud violations and the apparent increase in corrupt political activities have caused more political officials to face mail fraud prosecutions . The recent successful prosecution of a non-elected political official foreshadows the continuing evolution of the mail fraud act as one of the public 's protectors against bribery and extortion committed by government personnel . = = = Honest services fraud = = = At least from the 1970s , and perhaps earlier , the federal appellate courts permitted mail fraud prosecutions of public officials deprive the public of their intangible right to honest services . According to Professor John C. Coffee , \" [ t ] he mid 1970s saw the flowering of the ' intangible rights doctrine , ' an exotic flower that quickly overgrew the legal landscape in the manner of the kudzu vine until by the mid-1980s few ethical or fiduciary breaches seemed beyond its potential reach . \" In McNally v. United States ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that a \" scheme or artifice to defraud \" under the mail and wire fraud statutes did not include a scheme or artifice to defraud another of the intangible right to honest services . In 1988 , Congress responded by adding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 which provides : For the purposes of this chapter , the term \u201c scheme or artifice to defraud \u201d includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services . \u00a7 1346 was known as the \" McNally fix . \" In Skilling v. United States ( 2010 ) , the Court construed \u00a7 1346 to apply only to bribes and kickbacks . Post-Skilling is it unclear whether a mere gratuity can be prosecuted as a \" kickback . \" Skilling adopted the definition of \" kickback \" used in 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 52 ( 2 ) : \" [ K ] ickback \" means any money , fee , commission , credit , gift , gratuity , thing of value , or compensation of any kind which is provided , directly or indirectly , to any prime contractor , prime contractor employee , subcontractor , or subcontractor employee for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatment in connection with a prime contract or in connection with a subcontract relating to a prime contract . Post-Skilling , some courts have held that gratuities may be reached as kickbacks , while others have held that they may not . Prof. Coffee has argued that honest services fraud doctrine should explicitly distinguish between public and private corruption . = = Hobbs Act = = The Hobbs Act , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 , provides , in relevant part : ( a ) Whoever in any way or degree obstructs , delays , or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce , by . . . extortion or attempts or conspires so to do . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years , or both . ( b ) As used in this section . . . ( 2 ) The term \u201c extortion \u201d means the obtaining of property from another , with his consent , induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened . . . fear , or under color of official right . The Hobbs Act 's definition of \" extortion \" was \" copied from the New York Code substantially . \" The New York extortion law provided : \" Extortion is the obtaining of property from another , or the obtaining the property of a corporation from an officer , agent , or employee thereof , with his consent , induced by a wrongful use of force or fear , or under color of official right . \" Blackstone described extortion as \" an abuse of public justice , which consists of an officer 's unlawfully taking , by colour of his office , from any man , any money or thing of value that is not due to him , or more than is due , or before it is due . \" = = = Fear = = = The Hobbs Act criminalizes , inter alia , the obtaining of property with consent by actual or threatened fear , if interstate commerce is affected . The economic fear prong of the Hobbs Act may be used to prosecute political corruption , as long as there is an affirmative act of inducement ; but only the payees ( bribe-takers ) , and not the payors may be reached ( the latter have a defense of duress ) . Under the economic fear prong , \" [ t ] he absence or presence of fear of economic loss must be considered from the perspective of the victim , not the extortionist ; the proof need establish that the victim reasonably believed : first , that the defendant had the power to harm the victim , and second , that the defendant would exploit that power to the victim 's detriment . \" = = = Under color of official right = = = The Hobbs Act also criminalizes the obtaining of property under color of official right , if interstate commerce is affected . In a law review article published while the appeal in Kenny was pending , Stern wrote : At a time when the institutions of government , both local and federal , are being subjected to increasing attack and cynicism , those responsible of the enforcement of the law and the administration of justice cannot afford to allow one of the most powerful means of combatting official corruption to be emasculated by unwarranted , restrictive interpretation . The distinction between bribery and extortion that has developed under the Hobbs Act is unnecessary when that Act is used to prosecute corruption in public office . The phrase \" under color of official right \" which appears in the Act 's definition of extortion renders that distinction moot . In 1971 , Stern wrote that the Hobbs Act was \" one of the major statutes under which the federal government can combat local political corruption where the state is either unable or unwilling to do so , \" citing the Travel Act as the \" other major statute . \" In 1977 , Charles Ruff wrote that the Hobbs Act \" has become the principal vehicle for this rapidly expanding federal effort . \" Ruff describes Stern 's article as \" [ t ] he only detailed analysis of the problem before the recent flood of cases . \" By 1977 , the Third Circuit 's interpretation in Kenny had been adopted by the First , Second , Fourth , Seventh , Eighth , and Tenth Circuits . The Fifth , Sixth , and Ninth Circuits followed suit by 1986 . Some commentators have argued that the Hobbs Act should not be interpreted to reach public corruption at all . In McCormick v. United States ( 1991 ) , the Supreme Court held that the \" under color of official right \" prong of the Hobbs Act could be used to prosecute political corruption as long as there was a quid pro quo . Prior to McCormick , there was a circuit split on this question . The next year , in Evans v. United States ( 1992 ) , the Court held that no affirmative act of inducement is required on the part of the public official . Prior to Evans , there was also a circuit split on this question . Nor is a nexus required ; nor is the quo required to be within the de jure power of the public official , as opposed to access , generalized goodwill , or unspecific acts . Payors may not be prosecuted under the \" under color of official right \" prong , but have no duress defense under other statutes . Successful candidate for public office may be prosecuted for their pre-election actions , but unsuccessful candidates may not . = = Travel Act = = The Travel Act , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 , criminalizes , inter alia , the use of interstate travel or the mail to distribute the proceeds of , or promote or manage , unlawful activity , including extortion or bribery . The Travel Act has been used to prosecute political corruption . For example , the Travel Act may be used to prosecute public officials for extortion and bribery in violation of state law , as the Supreme Court held in United States v. Nardello ( 1969 ) . According to Curato et al . : From passage in 1961 until approximately 1971 , political officials were not prosecuted under the Travel Act . Since then , however , prosecutors and courts alike have found the Travel Act to be another valuable weapon in their continuing battle against the debilitating effects of political corruption . = = As a predicate = = = = = RICO = = = \" In the 1970s , federal prosecutors began to argue that RICO was applicable to corrupt state and local government bodies . \" With the exception of program bribery , all of the aforementioned offenses are predicates for liability under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) . A state or local governmental unit may be named as part of the charged RICO \" enterprise . \" As Henderson wrote in 1977 , \" if a governmental unit can be classified as an enterprise within the meaning of the statute , it could have great impact on the ability of prosecutors to reach political crimes . \" = = = Money laundering = = = All RICO predicates are also money laundering predicates .

The mail fraud statute has been justified under the Postal Clause . In Sabri v. United States ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the program bribery statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 , under the Spending Clause ( with Justice Clarence Thomas citing the Commerce Clause in concurrence ) . Prior to Sabri , several circuit courts had already so held . Professor Adam Kurland has proposed the Guarantee Clause of Article Four of the United States Constitution \u2014 which provides that \" [ t ] he United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a Republican Form of Government \" \u2014 as a constitutional basis for corruption statutes as applied to state and local officials . Professor John C. Coffee argues that \" there is a more modest role for the Guarantee Clause \" in distinguishing between public and private corruption under the same statutes . = = = Speech or Debate Clause = = = The Speech or Debate Clause of Article One of the United States Constitution provides that : \" [ F ] or any Speech or Debate in either House , [ Senators or Representatives ] shall not be questioned in any other Place . \" United States v. Johnson ( 1966 ) was the first case in which the Supreme Court held that the Clause barred a corruption prosecution . Specifically , the Court held that a floor speech by a Congressperson could not be admitted as evidence in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 281 ( the federal conflict-of-interest statute ) or \u00a7 371 ( conspiracy to defraud the United States ) to show the motivation for the introduction of a private bill . Representative Thomas Francis Johnson had agreed to make a speech in the House and intercede with the Department of Justice on behalf of a savings and loan association in exchange for a campaign contribution and legal fees . The Court has twice considered the role of the Clause in the prosecution of federal members of Congress for bribery under \u00a7 201 . In United States v. Brewster ( 1972 ) , the Court held that a \u00a7 201 prosecution of a Congressperson does not violate the Clause so long as \" no inquiry into legislative acts or motivation for legislative acts is necessary for the Government to make out a prima facie case . \" Brewster reinstated a dismissed \u00a7 201 indictment because the crime of bribery is complete once the bribe is accepted , whether or not the official performs the promised act . In United States v. Helstoski ( 1979 ) , the Court held that the prosecution may not introduce any evidence of a past \" legislative act \" at trial . According to Weeks , \" [ a ] s a practical matter , it is extremely difficult to successfully prosecute a section 201 action if reference to a defendant 's legislative acts is forbidden . \" = = = Federalism = = = Charles Ruff referred to \" the prosecution of local officials for acts of public corruption \" as \" perhaps the most sensitive area of federal-state cooperation . \" Several other commentators have expressed federalism concerns about such prosecutions . Others have disagreed . But , as Whitaker notes , \" Congress and the courts have not raised potential federalism concerns and , in fact , appear to approve of increased use of federal law to prosecute low-level bribery at the state and local levels . \" According to Professor John C. Coffee , \" [ a ] lthough this prophesy that the Supreme Court will curb the federal fraud statutes may yet prove accurate , that is not the direction in which the lower federal courts have been moving . \" In United States v. Gillock ( 1980 ) , a prosecution under the Hobbs Act and Travel Act , the Supreme Court declined to recognize a legislative act privilege for state legislators analogous in scope to the Speech or Debate Clause , either under the Tenth Amendment or Federal Rule of Evidence 501 . Gillock argued that \" recognition of an evidentiary privilege for state legislators for their legislative acts would impair the legitimate interest of the Federal Government in enforcing its criminal statutes with only speculative benefit to the state legislative process . \" Similarly , the courts have consistently rejected claims by convicted state legislators that their prosecutions violate the Tenth Amendment .",

                    "text": "Constitution of New Jersey = The Constitution of the State of New Jersey is the basic governing document of the State of New Jersey . In addition to three British Royal Charters issued for East Jersey , West Jersey and united New Jersey while they were still colonies , the state has been governed by three constitutions . The first was issued on July 2 , 1776 , shortly before New Jersey ratified the United States Declaration of Independence and the second was issued in 1844 . The current document was issued in 1947 and has been amended several times . The state constitution reinforces the basic rights found in the United States Constitution , but also contains several unique provisions , such as regulations governing the operation of casinos . At 26,159 words , the document is slightly shorter than the average American state constitution ( about 28,300 words ) . = = Previous versions = = Three fundamental documents had governed the territory now known as New Jersey . The first was the Concession and Agreement , which was written in 1665 by the colony 's proprietors Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret , and included a provision granting religious freedom . After Berkeley and Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers , the colony was split into West and East Jersey . Each had its own constitution : the West Jersey Constitution ( 1681 ) and the East Jersey Constitution ( 1683 ) . The two were reunited in 1702 by Queen Anne . New Jersey 's first state constitution was adopted on July 2 , 1776 . The American Revolutionary War was underway and George Washington had recently been defeated in New York , putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion . With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other , New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war . Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later , during this state of emergency , on July 2 , 1776 , the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment . Its primary objective was to provide a basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey 's fall into anarchy . And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State 's government for the next 68 years . Among other provisions , it granted unmarried women and blacks who met property requirements the right to vote . It did not specify an amendment procedure and had to be replaced entirely in a constitutional convention . The succeeding constitution , adopted on June 29 , 1844 , restricted suffrage to white males . It separated the government 's powers into judicial , legislative , and executive branches and granted the people ( as opposed to the legislature ) the ability to elect a governor . It also formally limited state debt , a predecessor of many contemporary \" debt ceiling \" clauses . The constitution was amended in 1875 , mainly to conform to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments . Additionally , the state 's amendments required that the legislature provide for a free public school system . = = Current constitution ( 1947 ) = = = = = Preamble = = = We , the people of the State of New Jersey , grateful to Almighty God for the civil and religious liberty which He hath so long permitted us to enjoy , and looking to Him for a blessing upon our endeavors to secure and transmit the same unimpaired to succeeding generations , do ordain and establish this Constitution . = = = \" Rights and Privileges \" = = = Article I , as is usual for constitutions , establishes the rights and freedoms inherent people and relevant operation of the government . The rights discussed in this Article largely mirror the Constitution of the United States . Such rights include freedom of speech , a speedy and public trial , and religious freedom . Article I also contains a Victims ' Bill of Rights . The article is a de facto enumeration of the rights of the common man ; Article I , Section I , Paragraph 21 deliberately states : This Article is similar to the U.S. Constitution 's enumeration of rights . Similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights , the document also still has \" holdover \" rights , or rights left over from fear of Britain during the Revolutionary War . These passages still do guarantee important rights to New Jerseyans , but violations are not necessarily common . Such rights include : = = = \" Elections and Suffrage \" = = = Article II lays out dates for elections of the Governor , the Lieutenant Governor , and members of the New Jersey Legislature . It establishes the qualifications necessary for voting and states the right of suffrage may be removed from certain convicted criminals . The process of absentee balloting is instituted , as well as the structure of voting by people currently in military service . The New Jersey Redistricting Commission is established , and the distribution of selection of its 13 members is discussed , who are to represent the \" geographic , ethnic and racial diversity \" of the state . The method of appointment of New Jersey Redistricting Commission members ensures the minority party which lost the general election prior to the census will have the upper hand in redistricting the state . Along with the other 12 appointed members , there is one \" independent \" member , who is to not have held office within the past five years . He is chosen by the other twelve members , yet is automatically the chairman of the Commission . On the occasion that the twelve members may not reach a decision , the Commission picks two ( which assumes there are two dominant parties which have their favorites ) and sends them to the New Jersey Supreme Court . A majority of the court ( 4 of 7 ) then picks the one that \" by education and occupational experience , by prior public service in government or otherwise , and by demonstrated ability to represent the best interest of the people of this State . \" = = = \" Distribution of the Powers of Government \" = = = The sole content of Article III is the statement regarding separation of powers . The three branches ( executive , judicial , and legislative ) are created and defined . No individual can be affiliated with more than one unless the Constitution explicitly allows it . Before the constitution was amended , a vacancy in the Governor of New Jersey would be filled by the president of the New Jersey Senate , who would retain their Senate seat . = = = \" Legislative \" = = = Article IV establishes the bicameral New Jersey Legislature , composed of 40 in the Senate and 80 in the General Assembly , and their apportionment amongst the state . The Apportionment Commission is created within the Legislature to modify the proration of legislative districts on a rolling basis , following every United States Census . It also creates the requirements for office , and the roles of the Senate and General Assembly . This includes the judging of elections , the selection of officers , a journal of proceedings , and the inability to adjourn for a period of greater than three days without the consent of the other house . This article also allows the Legislature to appoint commissions , committees , and other bodies to help perform the functions of the Legislature . Regulations regarding members of the Legislature , including singularity of employment . This is the law that no senator or member of the General Assembly can hold any other Federal or State position , and also cannot be a judge . Further topics are discussed , including bills , agencies , subdivisions , and emergencies . A negative enumeration of legislative powers is included within the article . Among this list of powers denied are granting divorces , gambling ( with obvious exceptions ) , and passing omnibus acts . Although the phrase omnibus acts is never formally used in this document , the actual wording skirts around the phrase : Finally , an oath / affirmation is included that is required by members and officers of the Legislature before the person enters upon his / her duties . = = = \" Executive \" = = = Article V enacts the executive branch . It also sets out the terms of office for the governor and lieutenant governor , the succession of future governors , and the process of gubernatorial elections . The Governor is given total authority over clemency except in cases of impeachment . This is to bar him from pardon in his own impeachment , or disturbing cases of treason . His clemency powers extend to the ability to suspend and remit fines and forfeitures . The system of granting parole is provided by law . The \" militia \" is created , or what is now the National Guard . Regulation regarding nominations and appointments of generals and flag offices is described . The executive and administrative offices , departments , and instrumentalities of the State government are placed under the supervision of the Governor . The Governor has the ability to appoint the Secretary of State and the Attorney General with the consent of the New Jersey Senate , though he also can appoint the Lieutenant Governor to serve as Secretary of State without consent of the Senate . He can also start inquiries into the conduct of officers and employees . = = = \" Judicial \" = = = Article VI creates the Judicial branch , and permits the establishment , alteration , and abolishment of any court other than the Supreme Court of New Jersey . Under the State Constitution , \" ' judicial power shall be vested in a Supreme Court , a Superior Court , County Courts and inferior courts of limited jurisdiction . ' \" The Supreme Court is New Jersey 's appellate court of last resort . \" By constitutional mandate , the Court consists of a Chief Justice and six associate justices , with five members constituting a quorum . \" Article VI , Section II , Paragraph 3 provides that , \" The Supreme Court makes its own rules governing the administration of all State courts ' and , subject to law , the practice and procedure of all such courts . ' \" The State Constitution renders the New Jersey Superior Court , Appellate Division the intermediate appellate court , and \" [ a ] ppeals may be taken to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court from the law and chancery divisions of the Superior Court and in such other causes as may be provided by law . \" \" The trial divisions of the Superior Court are the principal trial courts of New Jersey . They are located within the State 's various judicial geographic units , called ' vicinages , ' R. 1 : 33-2 ( a ) , and are organized into two basic divisions : the Chancery Division and the Law Division \" of the New Jersey Superior Court . The Governor 's power to appoint and nominate the judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts , with the consent of the Senate , is established . He may also nominate and appoint , with the consent of the Senate , judges of the inferior courts whose jurisdiction is only within one municipality . The term of office of Justices and Judges , including their retirement ages and pensions , is stated . Impeachment of Justices and Judges is also legalized , and their inabiling of powers until acquitted . During their term , the judges are restricted to one public office and may not practice law outside the state government . The powers of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are enumerated . Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed . = = = \" Public Officers and Employees \" = = = Article VII involves the public officers and employees , including appointment / nomination , compensation , promotions , affirmations , and powers . The role of officers in the state government is discussed . Before the officer enters the duties of office , the officer must subscribe an oath . Appointments for officers are based upon merit , fitness , and examinations . Fees are paid to the New Jersey State Treasury . The term of office for an officer commences on the day of the date of their commissions . The Auditor , who has a term of five years , is to be appointed by the New Jersey Senate and New Jersey General Assembly . The rest of the section details the duties of the State Auditor and the nomination / appointment of county prosecutors , county clerks , surrogates , and sheriffs . County prosecutors are nominated and appointed by the Governor . The term of office for county clerks and surrogates is five years , and for sheriffs three years . Impeachment and the process by which impeachment occurs are discussed : A state officer may be impeached while in office or for two years after leaving office . The impeachment process is similar to that of the Federal level : an absolute majority in the lower house ( the General Assembly ) against the employee causes a trial to take place in the upper house ( the State Senate ) with the Chief Justice presiding . Unlike the Federal process , the oath necessary to participate in the impeachment sessions is specified and requires the senators to \" truly and impartially \" address the charge as a reminder that they are exercising more judicial functions . \u2154 of the votes , or 27 votes , are needed to convict , but the President of the Senate is excluded from the trial , so the required percentage is slightly higher than \u2154 of 40 . The maximum penalty is removal from office with disqualification to hold further state office . However , the impeachment does not count towards the restriction on double jeopardy ; after being convicted by the senate , a person could then be tried by the judiciary and punished further . If this crime was listed according to Article II , Section I , Item 7 , the offender can be disenfranchised . = = = \" Taxation and Finance \" = = = In Article VIII , taxation is created . It states the Legislature 's duty to create laws \" to provide the value of land \" and the uniformity of these rules . Taxing of lands of agriculture is discussed , as well as taxation regulations regarding the re-use of agricultural land for different purposes . Tax exemption is legalized , including the continued tax exemptions carried over from the previous constitution . Alteration or repeal of tax exemption is allowed , provided that the real or personal property is not used for \" religious , educational , charitable or cemetery purposes , as defined by law , and owned by any corporation or association organized and conducted exclusively for one or more of such purposes and not operating for profit . \" Tax exemptions regarding the honorably discharged and exemptions for senior citizens who live in apartments and may / may not be disabled are discussed . Pensions , disability , and retirement programs for federal railroad workers , or any state employees are described . Surviving spouses of deceased citizens , besides exceptions , are entitled to tax deductions . This article also restricts any citizen from receiving more than one tax deduction . The Legislature 's right to instantiating a homestead statue is discussed . General laws enacted by legislature which permit municipalities to grant tax exemptions on buildings in blighted urban areas are legalized , with exceptions relating to the deduction 's permanence . Income taxes are banned unless the revenue is placed into a specific perpetual fund , or if the taxer is receiving payments from the Federal Railroad Retirement Act , or similar . The credit of the state is barred from being publicly or privately loaned . Any fiscal year plan which creates more than one percent debt and / or liabilities is banned . The voting on such plans in public elections is banned , as well as the creation of debt or liabilities \" for purposes of war , or to repel invasion , or to suppress insurrection or to meet an emergency caused by disaster or act of God . \" Taxation of motor vehicle fuel , and the funds the moneys are deposited in are discussed ; the appropriation of moneys from the Sales and Use Tax Act are defined . A council of local mandates is created , and regulation regarding the appointment of the members for this body . Some moneys from the Corporate Business Tax Act are directed to the General Fund . The appropriation of moneys to the remediation of hazardous discharges and buildings that hold hazardous substances or public water supplies are discussed . A General Fund is created , as well as the distribution of moneys into and from it . The \" clearance , replanning , development or redevelopment of blighted areas \" is made a public and state duty . The redevelopment of any of these properties is permitted to be completed by municipal , public , or private corporations . The continuing of appropriation of moneys to the corporation that completes the redevelopment after its completion is banned . A free public school system is created , as well as a busing system . The appropriation of moneys into the public school system fund is legalized . The lands that are tidal or were within forty years ago are protected from riparian claims . = = = \" Amendments \" = = = Article IX involves amendments to the New Jersey state constitution . A potential amendment is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly . The amendment is voted upon by both of the houses . If it gathers at least three-fifths of both the Senate and the General Assembly , the amendment is to be submitted to be voted upon by the people of New Jersey . If a majority votes for the amendment , the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote . It also explains how the amendments are submitted to the people , i.e. , all amendments are to be voted upon separately . = = = \" General Provisions \" = = = Article X contains involves miscellaneous final addenda . Paragraph 1 states that \" the seal of the State shall be kept by the Governor , or person administering the office of Governor , and used by him officially , and shall be called the Great Seal of the State of New Jersey . \" The seal 's design and the state flag are not mentioned . Paragraph 2 provides for the salutation and protocol of giving grants and commissions . Paragraph 3 states that that \" All writs shall be in the name of the State . All indictments shall conclude : \" against the peace of this State , the government and dignity of the same . \" Paragraph 4 provides for a rule of construction that words such as \" person \" and all pronouns include both sexes . Paragraph 5 provides that the effective date of the Constitution is January 1 , 1948 , \" except as herein otherwise provided . \" = = = \" Schedule \" = = = Article XI , the schedule , is the list of amendments to the Constitution in order of their addition . Sections I through IV , were adopted with the rest of the constitution . They lay out the process of supersession . The others were adopted as individual amendments . The Article orders the Legislature to pass all laws necessary for the activation of the new constitution . Existing instruments of government , contracts , officers , and judgments are continued unless they are expired , superseded , altered , or repealed . This is to prevent application as an ex post facto law or violation of the Contract Clause , both prohibited by the United States Constitution . The new legislature members are elected , and the process of election , term , and rotation are created . The members may be appointed to offices of government , likely new ones created at the behest of Article XI , Section I , Paragraph 2 . The remaining sections are the amendments . For reasons unknown , this constitution has never been directly updated since its adoption . The amendments are enumerated in this Article . Essentially , this section of the article records the development of the constitution through amendments . Such amendments include the abolishment of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and Chancery , transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts , such as the New Jersey Supreme Court . The requirement of the Federal Supreme Court that the apportionment of all state legislatures be by population is stated . It mainly consists of an interim list of districts and the number of Senators they can elect until the next United States Census comes around and is received by the Governor . It also contains provisions for apportioning ten districts of the lower house . If it is deadlocked , the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court will appoint an 11th and then the vote is by absolute majority . It was passed on election day , 1966 , but was first applied on January 17 , 2006 . This was superseded in 1995 by Article II , Section II . It took effect on December 7 , 1978 . Section VII , the final section of this constitution , was passed in a referendum on November 8 , 2005 , and takes full effect at noon , January 19 , 2010 , following the transfer of power to the next executive . = = Criticisms = = The New Jersey State Constitution has been criticized , mainly for its disorganized succession plan , as seen following Jim McGreevey 's resignation . Senate President Richard Codey assumed command , and since he legally held both positions , he temporarily had more power than any other governor in the country , being the head of both Executive and Legislative branches . An amendment was later passed to prevent the possibility of Executive and Legislative conflation in the future . The constitution has also been denounced for its unorganized composition . Paragraphs traditionally in Article I , e.g. , the banning of ex post facto laws , are in Article IV \" Legislative . \"",

                    "text": "Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore = Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore , specifically Article 14 ( 1 ) , guarantees to Singapore citizens the rights to freedom of speech and expression , peaceful assembly without arms , and association . However , the enjoyment of these rights may be restricted by laws imposed by the Parliament of Singapore on the grounds stated in Article 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution . There are two types of grounds . For the first type , it must be shown that restricting the rights is \" necessary or expedient in the interest \" of the grounds . The grounds are the security of Singapore and public order ( applicable to all three rights protected by Article 14 ( 1 ) ) , morality ( freedom of speech and freedom of association ) , and friendly relations with other countries ( freedom of speech only ) . In a 2005 judgment , the High Court expressed the view that the phrase necessary or expedient confers upon Parliament \" an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving any of the purposes specified in Art 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution \" . It is unnecessary for the courts to determine whether a legislative restriction of a right is reasonable . All that is required is a nexus between the objective underlying the restrictive law and one of the grounds specified in Article 14 ( 2 ) that Parliament is entitled to restrict the right on . The right to free speech is limited on the ground of the security of Singapore by the Official Secrets Act ( Cap . 213 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , and on the ground of public order by the Broadcasting Act ( Cap . 28 , 2003 Rev. Ed . ) and Newspaper and Printing Presses Act ( Cap . 206 , 2002 Rev. Ed . ) . Public order also justifies restrictions on both free speech and assembly imposed by the Sedition Act ( Cap . 290 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ( Cap . 257 , 2001 Rev. Ed . ) and Public Order Act ( Cap . 257A , 2012 Rev. Ed . ) ; and restrictions on the right to freedom of association imposed by the Societies Act ( Cap . 311 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) . Freedom of speech has also been limited on the basis of morality by the Films Act ( Cap . 107 , 1998 Rev. Ed . ) , which establishes film censorship and classification regimes ; and the Undesirable Publications Act ( Cap . 338 , 1998 Rev. Ed . ) , under which obscene or otherwise objectionable publications may be banned . No necessity or expedience requirement applies to the second type of grounds , which appear in Articles 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) ( restrictions \" designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence \" ) and 14 ( 3 ) ( laws relating to labour or education ) . At present , it appears that Parliament may restrict Article 14 ( 1 ) rights on these grounds simply by enacting legislation , and that the courts are not entitled to assess if the restrictions are appropriate . The privileges of Parliament are set out in the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act ( Cap . 217 , 2000 Rev. Ed . ) , and the Singapore courts have held that the common law offence of scandalizing the court ( a form of contempt of court ) does not violate Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) . The courts have also determined that the traditional common law rules of the tort of defamation strike a proper balance between free speech and the protection of reputation , and have declined to apply a public figure doctrine or responsible journalism as additional defences to the tort . = = Text of Article 14 = = Article 14 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore was designed to protect the rights to freedom of speech and expression , peaceful assembly without arms , and association . It is subject to Article 14 ( 2 ) which qualifies these rights . Judicial and statutory limits have been read into the Article , a process which is deemed necessary because the rights to free speech , assembly and association do not exist in a vacuum but jostle with competing interests and counter-values . As was said in Chee Siok Chin v. Ministry of Home Affairs ( 2005 ) , \" [ f ] reedom of action invariably ends where conflicting rights and / or interests collide \" . The text of Article 14 , which is entitled \" Freedom of speech , assembly and association \" , is as follows : 14 . \u2014 ( 1 ) Subject to clauses ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) \u2014 ( a ) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression ; ( b ) all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms ; and ( c ) all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations . ( 2 ) Parliament may by law impose \u2014 ( a ) on the rights conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( a ) , such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof , friendly relations with other countries , public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence ; ( b ) on the right conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( b ) , such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof or public order ; and ( c ) on the right conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( c ) , such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof , public order or morality . ( 3 ) Restrictions on the right to form associations conferred by clause ( 1 ) ( c ) may also be imposed by any law relating to labour or education . Articles 14 ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) are in pari materia with Articles 10 ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) of the Constitution of Malaysia , from which they were adopted following Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 . Articles 14 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are also somewhat similar to Articles 19 ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of the Constitution of India . There is no constitutional right to bear arms in Singapore , as Article 14 ( 1 ) ( b ) provides Singapore citizens with \" the right to assemble peaceably and without arms \" . Under the Arms and Explosives Act , no person may possess , import , export , manufacture or deal in any arms or explosives without a licence . It may be that the words and without arms were included in Article 14 ( 1 ) ( b ) to ensure that arguments based on the clause in the English Bill of Rights 1689 stating that \" the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law \" , which inspired the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ( \" A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . \" ) , cannot be raised in Singapore . The freedoms of speech , assembly and association guaranteed by the Constitution are enjoyed only by Singapore citizens . In Review Publishing Co . Ltd. v. Lee Hsien Loong ( 2009 ) , it was held that the appellant newspaper company did not have the requisite locus standi to rely on the constitutional right of free speech and expression as it was not a Singapore citizen , and Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution expressly provides that only Singapore citizens are entitled to the right . = = Restrictions on the rights = = The rights guaranteed to the citizens of Singapore by Article 14 ( 1 ) are subject to restrictions set out in subsection ( 2 ) of the same Article . In Chee Siok Chin , Justice V.K. Rajah elucidated the justification for these qualifications : The right of freedom of expression should never be exercised on the basis that opinions are expressed in hermetically sealed vacuums where only the rights of those who ardently advocate their views matter . That is entirely inappropriate . Freedom of expression when left unchecked may reach a point where protest , criticism and expression culminate in nuisance or something even more serious . The law inevitably has to intervene then . In 1993 in a statement delivered at the World Conference on Human Rights , the Minister for Foreign Affairs Wong Kan Seng took the position that \" order and stability are essential for development \" as economic growth requires a stable legal environment protective of contractual and property rights . Excessive focus on civil-political liberties during the early stages of national development would impair this . However , the Government appears to have loosened restrictions on political liberties like free speech over time to manage demands for a more participatory political culture . In fact , citizens were urged by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong not to be \" passive bystanders in their own fate \" but to debate issues \" with reason , passion and conviction \" . Wrestling with \" honest differences \" was to be preferred over being \" an apathetic society with no view \" . Parliament may impose restrictions on the rights guaranteed by Article 14 ( 1 ) on two types of grounds . For the first type , it must be shown that restricting the rights is \" necessary or expedient in the interest \" of the grounds . No such requirement applies to the second type of grounds , which appear in Articles 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) and 14 ( 3 ) . At present , it appears that Parliament may restrict Article 14 ( 1 ) rights on these grounds simply by enacting legislation , and that the courts are not entitled to assess if the restrictions are appropriate . = = = Meaning of Parliament may by law impose = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution states that \" Parliament may by law impose \" restrictions on the rights referred to in Article 14 ( 1 ) . This is arguably in line with Singapore 's adoption of the Westminster system of government that rests upon parliamentary supremacy , the rule of law and common law principles . The terms law and written law are defined in Article 2 ( 1 ) of the Constitution as follows : In this Constitution , unless it is otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires \u2014 \" law \" includes written law and any legislation of the United Kingdom or other enactment or instrument whatsoever which is in operation in Singapore and the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore and any custom or usage having the force of law in Singapore ; ... \" written law \" means this Constitution and all Acts and Ordinances and subsidiary legislation for the time being in force in Singapore . One reading of Article 14 ( 2 ) is that in order to restrict the rights to freedom of speech , assembly and association , Parliament must impose the restrictions by passing written laws , that is , Acts of Parliament , since it exercises the legislative power of Singapore by passing bills that are assented to by the President . However , in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew ( 1990 ) , a case involving defamation law , the Court of Appeal took a much broader approach . The Court noted that according to Article 2 ( 1 ) , law in Article 14 ( 2 ) includes the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore . In May 1963 , the Parliament of Malaysia had enacted the Malaysia Act 1963 , which extended the Defamation Act 1957 to Singapore , then a state in the Federation of Malaysia . Since the Act , now the Defamation Act ( Cap . 75 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , was premised on common law rules of the tort of defamation , the Court held that the Legislature had \" clearly intended that the common law relating to defamation , as modified by the Act , should continue to apply in Singapore \" . Thus , it is \" manifestly beyond argument that Art 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) is subject to the common law of defamation as modified by the Act \" . It has been said that this argument \" suffers from two fatal flaws \" . There is no evidence that the constitutionality of the existing rules of defamation was considered by either the Malaysian or Singapore Parliaments . More significantly , even if the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore had believed these rules to be constitutional , this should not have been treated by the Court of Appeal as decisive as it is the courts ' duty to independently determine whether the assumption is justified . Otherwise , a similar argument might be extended to all legislation passed by Parliament , and \" [ i ] t is not difficult to see that this would spell the end of constitutional law itself \" . = = = Restrictions premised on necessity or expediency = = = Parliament may restrict the rights to free speech , assembly and association on the grounds set out in the table below if it is \" necessary or expedient in the interest \" of them : In Chee Siok Chin , the High Court interpreted the phrase necessary or expedient as conferring upon Parliament \" an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving any of the purposes specified in Art 14 ( 2 ) of the Constitution \" . The Court emphasized the fact that , unlike Article 19 ( 3 ) of the Constitution of India which provides that the right to fetter the freedom of speech and assembly is subject to the touchstone of reasonableness , Singapore 's Article 14 ( 2 ) does not contain the word reasonable . However , despite the broad power that Article 19 ( 3 ) accords to the Indian courts , they have been \" most reluctant \" to invalidate legislation purportedly infringing the rights to free speech or assembly . There exists a strong presumption of legislative constitutionality , as the Supreme Court of India has expressed a need for \" judicial self-restraint and extreme caution \" when determining whether legislation unreasonably restricts a constitutional right . It has been noted that the Indian courts have thus been used to exemplify how much more deference Singapore courts should give to the Government , and that the Article 14 ( 2 ) derogation clause was said to confer upon Parliament a great amount of discretionary power . The High Court also rejected the use of a proportionality analysis when determining the extent of Parliament 's powers to impose restrictions on individual rights . The analysis enables the judiciary to assess if an interference with rights is proportionate to a legitimate and important aim of the legislation in question . A court will inquire into whether relevant and sufficient reasons justify the statutory interference , and may substitute its own judgment for that of Parliament . The High Court concluded : \" Needless to say , the notion of proportionality has never been part of the common law in relation to the judicial review of the exercise of a legislative and / or an administrative power or discretion . Nor has it ever been part of Singapore law . \" Bearing in mind these restraints , the court 's only task is to ascertain whether an impugned law is within the purview of any of the permissible restrictions . Hence , all that needs to be established is a nexus between the object of the law in question and one of the permissible subjects stipulated in Article 14 ( 2 ) . In doing so , the Government must merely satisfy the court that there is a factual basis on which Parliament has considered it \" necessary or expedient \" to restrict one 's individual right to freedom of speech , assembly or association . When determining whether legislative restrictions are \" in the interest of \" the relevant purposes specified in Article 14 ( 2 ) , the courts may examine the impugned statute , relevant parliamentary material and contemporary speeches and documents , and will adopt a \" generous and not a pedantic interpretation \" . Moreover , the term in the interest of , when contrasted with the maintenance of , grants \" a much wider legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach \" and includes \" laws that are not purely designed or crafted for the immediate or direct maintenance \" of the Article 14 ( 2 ) grounds . = = = = Security of Singapore ; friendly relations with other countries = = = = Parliament may restrict the rights to freedom of speech , assembly or association if it is necessary or expedient in the interests of the security of Singapore or any part thereof . The courts have taken a broad approach to this exception , and have shown a considerable amount of deference to the Government . For instance , in Public Prosecutor v. Phua Keng Tong ( 1986 ) , a case involving the Official Secrets Act , the High Court held that security in Article 14 ( 2 ) does not merely mean protection from danger but includes the \" protection of information which the Government considers vital or essential for its administration \" . However , not everything that the Government regards as an official secret will be necessarily be deemed to be so by the court , especially if the information is \" innocuous in nature \" . The burden of proving that official information is secret lies on the Prosecution . Freedom of speech and expression may also be restricted in the interest of friendly relations with other countries . This ground of restriction has not yet been considered by local courts , but might have justified the withdrawal by the Board of Film Censors ( BFC ) of a certificate issued for the film Zoolander ( 2001 ) with effect from 8 February 2002 . The film , a comedy about a male model played by Ben Stiller who is brainwashed into attempting to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia , had earlier been condemned by the Malaysian Film Censorship Board as \" definitely unsuitable \" , though it did not impose a ban as it expected film distributors to exercise discretion . The BFC stated only that the film had been banned \" in view of controversial elements gathered from feedback \" . The ban was lifted at the beginning of 2006 , which enabled the film to be released on DVD . = = = = Public order = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) also empowers Parliament to impose restrictions on the rights guaranteed by all three limbs of Article 14 ( 1 ) on the ground of public order . The term public order has been given an expansive interpretation that highlights the importance which the Singapore Government places upon social stability . In Chee Siok Chin , which dealt with the constitutionality of sections 13A and 13B of the Miscellaneous Offences ( Public Order and Nuisance ) Act the High Court approved the following quotation from V.N. Shukla 's Constitution of India ( 9th ed . , 1994 ) : The expression ' public order ' is synonymous with public peace , safety , and tranquility . It signifies absence of disorder involving breaches of local significance in contradistinction to national upheavals such as revolution , civil strife or war , affecting the security of the State . To illustrate , the State may , in the interests of public order , prohibit and punish the causing of loud and raucous noise in streets and public places by means of sound amplifying instruments ; regulate the hours and place of public discussions and the use of public streets for the purpose of exercising freedom ; provide for expulsion of hecklers from meetings and assemblies ; punish utterances tending to incite breach of the peace or riot and use of threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour in any public place or at any public meeting with intent to cause a breach of the peace or whereby breach of the peace is likely to be caused , and all such acts as would endanger public safety . Such an interpretation is consistent with earlier cases . In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor ( 1994 ) , Chief Justice Yong Pung How considered the term in relation to the right to freedom of religion embodied in Article 15 ( 4 ) of the Constitution and stated : I am of the view that religious beliefs ought to have proper protection , but actions undertaken or flowing from such beliefs must conform with the general law relating to public order and social protection . The right of freedom of religion must be reconciled with \" the right of the State to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace , security and orderly living without which constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery \" ( Commissioner , HRE v LT Swamiar AIR 1954 SC 282 ) . The sovereignty , integrity and unity of Singapore are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the Constitution and anything , including religious beliefs and practices , which tend to run counter to these objectives must be restrained . In Chee Siok Chin it was further clarified that \" the legislative power to circumscribe the rights conferred by Art 14 of the Constitution is , inter alia , delineated by what is ' in the interest of public order ' and not confined to ' the maintenance of public order ' . This is a much wider legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach in the maintenance of public order . This necessarily will include laws that are not purely designed or crafted for the immediate or direct maintenance of public order ... \" . = = = = = Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly = = = = = The Government has power to limit the circulation of local and foreign media in Singapore under the Broadcasting Act and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act ( \" NPPA \" ) . These Acts can be considered as imposing restrictions on free speech based on public order . For instance , the Broadcasting ( Class Licence ) Notification , made under section 9 of the Broadcasting Act , makes it mandatory for an Internet content provider to register with the Media Development Authority ( MDA ) if it is , or if the Authority thinks that it is , an individual providing any programme about or a body of persons engaged in the \" propagation , promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore , on the World Wide Web through the Internet \" . The MDA can fine a licensee , or suspend or cancel its licence , if it has breached the terms of its licence , any relevant code of practice issued by the Authority , any provisions of the Broadcasting Act , or any direction issued by the Authority or the Minister for Information , Communications and the Arts . In addition , it is an offence to provide a broadcasting service without a licence , and a convicted person is liable to a fine of up to S $ 200,000 , jail of up to three years , or both . If the offence continues after conviction , a further fine of up to $ 10,000 per day may be imposed . The Minister may declare that any foreign broadcasting service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been \" engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore \" . Rebroadcasting such a \" declared foreign broadcasting service \" is prohibited without the Minister 's approval , which can be refused , revoked without reasons , or granted on conditions , which may include restrictions on the number of people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods . Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $ 100,000 . Similar provisions exist in the NPPA to enable the circulation of foreign newspapers in Singapore to be restricted . In February 1987 , the Asian Wall Street Journal was declared to have engaged in domestic politics and its circulation was limited to 400 copies . The newspaper 's publisher , Dow Jones Publishing Co . ( Asia ) Inc . , applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for certiorari to quash the Minister 's orders . On appeal to the Court of Appeal , Dow Jones argued that the Minister had acted irrationally and misinterpreted scope of his powers under the NPPA by not considering the right to free speech protected by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) . The Court dismissed the argument on the ground that Dow Jones could not rely on the Article as it only applied to Singapore citizens . Furthermore , even if Dow Jones could raise the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the NPPA on the basis that Singapore citizens were indirectly affected by it , it was not evident that the right to free speech included the right to receive information . In any case , even if the latter argument was accepted , it might be said that the right of Singapore citizens to receive information by reading the Asian Wall Street Journal had not been impaired since 400 copies of it were still in circulation . The Court interpreted the term domestic politics broadly , holding that in Singapore 's context it included : ... the political system of Singapore and the political ideology underpinning it , the public institutions that are a manifestation of the system and the policies of the government of the day that give life to the political system . In other words , the domestic politics of Singapore relate to the multitude of issues concerning how Singapore should be governed in the interest and for the welfare of its people . In addition to empowering the Minister to limit the circulation of foreign newspapers as described above , the NPPA generally imposes curbs on the foreign ownership of newspaper companies , and requires a permit to be obtained for the publication , sale and distribution of newspapers . In a September 2011 statement , the Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts justified the NPPA 's existence , stating : \" The various safeguards provided for in the NPPA help to ensure that the media operating in Singapore play a responsible role and that publishers are accountable for the content they publish . The safeguards also prevent local newspapers from being manipulated by foreign interests which can have a divisive effect on social cohesion . These considerations are still valid today . Journalistic freedom to report responsibly has not been compromised . \" The Sedition Act , Public Entertainments and Meetings Act , and Public Order Act 2009 are statutes which arguably impose restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression , as well as the freedom of assembly , in the interests of public order . The Sedition Act has been used to restrict the propagation of opinions that have a seditious tendency , which includes a tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of Singapore 's population . In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin ( 2005 ) , the accused was convicted under the Act for posting invective and pejorative anti-Muslim remarks on a blog and a forum on the Internet ; and in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong and another ( 2009 ) , a married couple were similarly convicted for distributing religious tracts that were considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims . The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act renders it an offence to provide public entertainment and hold meetings without a licence , and its constitutionality has been upheld before the courts in cases concerning political activities organized by opposition parties . = = = = = Restrictions on the freedom of association = = = = = The right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( c ) is curtailed on public order grounds by the Societies Act . The Act requires all clubs , companies , partnerships and associations of ten or more persons to be registered with the Registrar of Societies unless they are already lawfully registered under other statutes . The Registrar may refuse to register certain specified societies if satisfied that , among other things , they are likely to be used \" for purposes prejudicial to public peace , welfare or good order in Singapore \" ; it would be contrary to the national interest ; or , if the society is a political association , its rules do not require all its members to be Singapore citizens or it is affiliated with some foreign organization that the Registrar considers contrary to the national interest . The list of specified societies includes the following : A society representing , promoting any cause or interest of , or discussing an issue relating to any clan , ethnic group , nationality or religion , or a class of persons defined by reference to their gender or sexual orientation . A political association . A society representing people who advocate , promote or discuss any issue relating to any civil or political right , including animal rights , environmental rights and human rights . A society discussing any matter relating to how Singapore society is governed . Any society that is not registered is deemed to be an unlawful society , and , as regards such a society , being involved in its management , being a member of it , and attending its meetings , are all offences . The Minister for Home Affairs also has power to order that a registered society be dissolved if it appears to him or her that , among other things , it is being used for unlawful purposes or for purposes \" prejudicial to public peace , welfare or good order in Singapore \" . Once an order has been made , the society becomes an unlawful society . On 14 January 1972 , the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses was dissolved , the Minister stating that the existence of the society was prejudicial to public welfare and good order because its members refused to do National Service , which is generally compulsory for male citizens and second-generation permanent residents . An attempt in Chan Hiang Leng Colin to challenge the ban on the grounds of freedom of religion protected by Article 15 ( 1 ) of the Constitution proved unsuccessful . = = = = Morality = = = = Parliament may , under Articles 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) and 14 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Constitution , rely on the ground of morality to impose restrictions on two of the constitutional freedoms embodied in Article 14 : the right to freedom of speech and expression , and the right to freedom of association . There are currently no Singaporean cases which have specifically discussed the meaning of morality . However , legislation such as the Films Act , which establishes film censorship and classification regimes ; and the Undesirable Publications Act , under which obscene or otherwise objectionable publications may be banned , can be regarded as restrictions on free expression pursuant to this ground . In Rathinam Ramesh v. Public Prosecutor ( 2010 ) , where the issue was the sentence that should be imposed on a person convicted of distributing uncertified films contrary to the Films Act , the High Court held that \" the control of film distribution under the Films Act was for the purpose of maintaining public order and morality \" and the accused had not undermined public morality since the films he had been distributing were not obscene . With regard to the issue of censorship , in 2003 the Censorship Review Committee said that \" the responsibility to guide and control will have to be increasingly borne by the individual , the public , particularly parents , and the industry . While the regulator may define and regulate sensitive areas like race and religion , in the areas of morality , the responsibility will have to be devolved to the public and citizen advisory committees . \" In response , the Ministry of Information , Communication and the Arts ( MICA ) stated that the Government \" must continue to remain mindful of the concerns and values of the majority \" . The meaning of morality is therefore dependent on the views of the majority of Singapore citizens , as expressed through public channels and citizen advisory committees . Censorship has therefore been applied to obscene content that \" erodes moral values through pornography , deviant sexual practices , sexual violence , child pornography , bestiality , etc . \" Public morality is not a static idea , but one that evolves with societal norms and values . For example , the MICA has endorsed a \" flexible and contextual approach for homosexual content \" , and has liberalized its censorship of issues such as violence , sexual content and nudity , and coarse language in media . = = = Restrictions not premised on necessity or expediency = = = Unique to Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) is an addendum stating that the right to freedom of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament , or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence . The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds . = = = = Protection of the privileges of Parliament = = = = Article 63 of the Constitution provides for the Legislature to \" determine and regulate the privileges , immunities or powers of Parliament \" by law , and it has done so by enacting the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act . Under the Act , it is a contempt of Parliament to perform certain acts , for instance , to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament ( MP ) coming to or going from Parliament on account of his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament ; or to publish any statement , whether in writing or otherwise , which falsely or scandalously defames , or which reflects on the character of , the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament . It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression . However , there is not yet any case law addressing this provision , and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction . = = = = Contempt of court = = = = = = = = = Constitutionality of the offence of scandalizing the court = = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution provides that Parliament may restrict the right to freedom of speech and expression to provide against contempt of court . One of the more prominent uses of the court 's contempt power has been for the Attorney-General to charge persons with the common law offence of scandalizing the court . The High Court case of Attorney-General v. Wain ( 1991 ) established that by enacting section 8 ( 1 ) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act ( Cap . 322 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) ( now section 7 ( 1 ) of Cap . 322 , 2007 Rev. Ed . ) ( \" SCJA \" ) , which states that \" [ t ] he High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have power to punish for contempt of court \" , Parliament had conferred on these courts the power to act against persons that have scandalized the court . Furthermore , Article 162 could not be relied upon to require that the offence be read down to conform with the right to freedom of speech and expression . Article 162 states : Subject to this Article , all existing laws shall continue in force on and after the commencement of this Constitution and all laws which have not been brought into force by the date of the commencement of this Constitution may , subject as aforesaid , be brought into force on or after its commencement , but all such laws shall , subject to this Article , be construed as from the commencement of this Constitution with such modifications , adaptations , qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with this Constitution . The Court reasoned that Article 162 had no application to the SCJA as the latter was not an existing law at the date of commencement of the Constitution ( that is , 9 August 1965 ) , having been enacted in 1969 . However , the Court did not consider the effect of Article 4 of the Constitution on the offence . That Article states : \" This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall , to the extent of the inconsistency , be void . \" Subsequently , in Attorney-General v. Chee Soon Juan ( 2006 ) , the High Court held that the offence of scandalizing the court could not be regarded as unconstitutional since Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) clearly empowered Parliament to restrict free speech in order to punish acts amounting to contempt of court . Parliament had done so by enacting section 7 ( 1 ) of the SCJA . = = = = = Constitutionality of the elements of the offence = = = = = The classic definition of a contempt by scandalizing the court was enunciated in R. v. Gray ( 1900 ) by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales , Lord Russell of Killowen , who said : \" Any act done or writing published calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt , or to lower his authority , is a contempt of Court . \" Up until Attorney-General v. Shadrake ( 2010 ) , the High Court had adopted an \" inherent tendency \" test to determine liability for the offence . This was in contrast to the \" real risk \" test adopted by many other common law countries . The inherent tendency test was characterized by the act or words complained of possessing an inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice . Moreover , an act or statement would have such an inherent tendency if it conveyed to an average reasonable reader or viewer allegations of bias , lack of impartiality , impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge ( and a fortiori , a court ) in the exercise of his judicial function . In Shadrake , Justice Quentin Loh suggested that the distinction between the tests was in truth illusory . He expressed the view that if it was purely a question of semantics , it would be preferable for the court to adopt the real risk test as it precisely conveys to laymen and lawyers what the law is concerned with . He stated : The [ inherent tendency ] formula has shown itself to be susceptible to controversy and misunderstanding , not least because the literal meaning of inherent tendency tends to obscure the fact that a contextual analysis is actually required . Indeed , given how the word ' inherent ' is commonly understood to indicate something intrinsic , an inherent tendency test would therefore appear to preclude any consideration of extrinsic factors . Holding that \" a publication must post a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice before it is held to be contemptuous \" , Loh J. elucidated the elements of the real risk test as follows : A real risk is not to be equated with a serious or grave risk , but merely something more than a de minimis , remote or fanciful risk . Whether such a real risk is posed is an objective question of fact to be determined in light of all the circumstances of the case . The law is not concerned with the effect of the impugned publication , but the potential effect on public confidence in the administration of justice . Counsel for the respondent had argued that the right to free speech compelled the adoption of the real risk test . However , the Court declined to consider the matter as it had already decided to adopt the test , and since full arguments had not been made on the point . Nonetheless , Loh J. said that the courts had to define the offence \" consistently with the words , structure and spirit of Art 14 , which clearly demand some kind of balance to be struck between the freedom of speech , which is the rule , and the offence of contempt , an exception to the rule . At the very minimum , neither can be defined in such a way that renders the other otiose . \" He noted that the respondent 's counsel had not argued that the offence is inherently unconstitutional , and that a majority of cases had concluded that the real risk test , coupled with a right of fair criticism , is a reasonable limitation on free speech . On appeal , the Court of Appeal in Shadrake v. Attorney-General ( 2011 ) held that the apparent difference between the inherent tendency test and the real risk test was a \" legal red herring \" . However , since the inherent tendency test had caused confusion , it affirmed the High Court 's ruling that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing the court . It felt that trying to elaborate on the meaning of a \" real risk \" was not helpful , and that the court should simply ask itself whether , \" having regard to the facts as well as surrounding context , a ' real risk ' that public confidence in the administration of justice is \u2013 or would be \u2013 undermined as a result of the impugned statement ? \" Although fair criticism has been treated as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases , the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability , though it cautioned that \" the precise characterisation of the concept of fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... . Accordingly , our views on this point must necessarily be taken , to that extent , to be provisional in nature . \" The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof : \" If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability , then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it . The legal burden , on the other hand , would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism , and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice . If , however , the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence , then the legal burden would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism . \" The Court approved the factors set out by the High Court in Attorney-General v. Tan Liang Joo John ( 2009 ) that are relevant in establishing that criticism of the courts is fair : Criticism must be supported by argument and evidence . Criticism must generally be expressed in a temperate and dispassionate manner . This allows rational debate about the issues raised , and thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice . Courts can take into consideration the party 's attitude in court and the number of instances of condemning conduct . In Tan Liang Joo John , Justice Judith Prakash stated that this was not a closed list , and that the court is entitled to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith . She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism \u2013 that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity , propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts . However , she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism . As regards the relationship between the offence of scandalizing the court and the right to free speech , the Court of Appeal commented that : ... the law relating to contempt of court operates against the broader legal canvass [ sic : canvas ] of the right to freedom of speech that is embodied both within Art 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ... as well as the common law . The issue , in the final analysis , is one of balance : just as the law relating to contempt of court ought not to unduly infringe the right to freedom of speech , by the same token , that right is not an absolute one , for its untrammelled abuse would be a negation of the right itself . The Court pointed out that the last mentioned point was embodied in Article 14 ( 2 ) and noted that Parliament had provided the courts with jurisdiction to punish for contempt by enacting section 7 ( 1 ) of the SCJA . It held that the real risk test strikes an appropriate balance between free speech and its abuse , and declined to apply the \" clear and present danger \" test applicable to the First Amendment to the US Constitution as free speech had gained a paramount status in the US quite different from Commonwealth jurisdictions due to the nation 's unique cultural and constitutional heritage . = = = = Defamation = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution also provides Parliament with the power to impose restrictions designed to provide against defamation . The law of defamation thus functions as a restriction on a person 's right to freedom of speech . The law of defamation has its roots in the common law which existed before the enactment of the Constitution in 1965 . As such , the courts must take Article 162 of the Constitution into consideration when deciding whether the common law tort of defamation offends the fundamental liberty of freedom of speech and expression . The Article provides that all existing laws shall continue in force after the commencement of the Constitution subject to \" modifications , adaptations , qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity \" with the Constitution of Singapore . However , in Review Publishing , the Court of Appeal held that the common law of defamation , as modified by the Defamation Act , restricts the right to free speech . The appellants in that case pointed out that the Defamation Ordinance 1960 , which presupposed the existence of the common law of defamation , had been enacted before the 1963 Constitution of the State of Singapore . Thus , it could not have been a law enacted to derogate from the right to free speech guaranteed by Article 10 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia , which became applicable to Singapore when it became a state of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 . The Court disagreed , holding that Article 105 ( 1 ) of the 1963 State Constitution , which was the predecessor of Article 162 , had the effect of re-enacting all laws existing as at 16 September 1963 , including the Defamation Ordinance . Thus Article 105 ( 1 ) itself was an express restriction on the right to free speech . If this was not the case , then when the 1963 State Constitution came into force all laws which restricted Article 10 ( 1 ) of the Federal Constitution would have become unconstitutional , a result which the Court regarded as an \" astonishing conclusion \" . = = = = = Defence of qualified privilege and the public figure doctrine = = = = = Article 14 of the Constitution has been raised as a point of contention in relation to the defence of qualified privilege . The Court of Appeal has discussed the applicability of Article 14 in two cases concerning prominent government figures . In Jeyaratnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew ( 1992 ) , Justice L.P. Thean , when delivering the judgment of the court , held that \" [ p ] ersons holding public office or politicians ... are equally entitled to have their reputations protected as those of any other persons \" . In this case , counsel for the appellant argued that \" qualified privilege attaches to defamatory publications concerning public officials ( or candidates for a public office ) relating to their official conduct or the performance of their public duties by those who have an honest and legitimate interest in the matter to those who have a corresponding and legitimate interest ( whether as electors or as citizens potentially affected by the conduct of public officials ) \" . The fact that the statements were made in a political rally during the run-up to elections meant that the requirement of a legitimate interest was met . Lingens v. Austria ( 1986 ) was relied upon in support of the premise that \" the limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual \" . In Lingens , the European Court of Human Rights was of the opinion that a politician \" inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large , and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance \" . The reasoning of the European Court was in line with the public figure doctrine enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) , where the United States Supreme Court decided in favour of the defendant newspaper , making it one of the key decisions supporting the freedom of the press . However , the Singapore Court of Appeal dismissed the applicability of both cases on the ground that the terms of Article 14 of the Constitution differ materially from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which was relied upon by the court in Lingens ; as well as the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which were relied upon by the court in New York Times . The public figure doctrine was thus expressly rejected by the Court . Thean J. said : \" Such criticisms or attacks must , in our opinion , respect the bounds set by the law of defamation , and we do not accept that the publication of false and defamatory allegations , even in the absence of actual malice on the part of the publisher , should be allowed to pass with impunity . \" To further rebut the presumption that the circumstances of a general election are sufficient to give rise to an occasion of privilege , the Court also relied on section 14 of the Defamation Act which , at the time , provided thus : A defamatory statement published by or on behalf of a candidate in any election to Parliament or other elected or partially elected body shall not be deemed to be published on a privileged occasion on the ground that it is material to a question in issue in the election , whether or not the person by whom it is published is qualified to vote at the election . The court was unwilling to extend the traditional defence of qualified privilege as it was of the opinion that Parliament 's intention in enacting section 14 was clear : it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or on behalf of a candidate for the election is not . The Court of Appeal 's reasoning in Jeyaretnam has been the subject of academic criticism . Michael Hor has criticized the distinction drawn by the Court between Article 14 of the Constitution and its American and European counterparts as overly literal . The current interpretation of the law gives the legislature an unfettered discretion in limiting freedom of speech in Singapore through the enactment and amendment of relevant legislation . Hor opines that : What is instructive and applicable in Singapore is the realisation that it is the constitutional responsibility of the judiciary to ensure that the basic commitment to the freedom of speech is not undermined by giving the Legislature carte blanche to derogate therefrom in either some or all of the specified exceptions . Our courts must assume the task of scrutinising the prevailing rules of defamation to ensure that they strike a justifiable balance between the freedom of speech and the need to protect individual reputation . Hor has also said that the Court 's approach in Jeyaretnam fails to provide adequate safeguards to account for future politicians and holders of public office who may be less than honourable . Moreover , Singapore courts should not start with the assumption that the common law is necessarily constitutional , as this would be tantamount to \" putting the cart before the horse \" . Rather , the Constitution ought to be interpreted consistently with the common law . = = = = = Defence of responsible journalism = = = = = In Review Publishing , Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong , delivering judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal , declined to infer into the common law of Singapore the defence of responsible journalism , or \" Reynolds privilege \" , developed by the House of Lords in Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd . ( 1999 ) , at least where non-Singapore citizens who have been sued for defamation are seeking to rely on it . This was because the defence was not a natural development of common law principles but had been impelled by the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 of the European Convention . The Reynolds privilege could only be adopted in Singapore on the basis of the right to free speech guaranteed by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution . However , as the appellants were not Singapore citizens , they could not rely on this provision . The Court then discussed , on an obiter basis , the applicability of the Reynolds privilege to Singapore citizens . It held that the key question is whether or not , in the context of publication of matters of public interest , the rationale behind the Reynolds privilege ought to apply such that constitutional free speech is the rule and restrictions on this right are the exception . In considering the factors relevant to the key question , Chan C.J. stated that whilst the court has the power to dictate the direction of the common law of defamation as adopted upon the enactment of the Constitution , Parliament still has overriding powers to limit the freedom of speech and expression where defamatory publications and statements are made : First , our courts must be mindful of the extent to which they can decide whether constitutional free speech should prevail over protection of reputation . Although there is nothing in Art 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Singapore Constitution and the Defamation Act which precludes our courts from developing the common law of defamation for the common convenience and welfare of society in keeping with Singapore 's prevailing political , social and cultural values ( save for those provisions in these two statutes which impose such a restriction ) , Art 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) also expressly provides that it is Parliament which has the final say on how the balance between constitutional free speech and protection of reputation should be struck . Secondly , when striking a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of reputation , the court will need to make a value judgment that is dependent on local political and social conditions . The Court said that the following factors were relevant to the making of this value judgment : In its opinion , the balance between constitutional free speech and protection of reputation that has been struck by the current law of defamation in Singapore is appropriate in the circumstances of the present day . Singapore law does not recognize journalistic material that relates to matters of public interest as having any particular importance , and \" there is no room in our political context for the media to engage in investigative journalism which carries with it a political agenda \" . Honesty and integrity in public discourse on matters of public interest , particularly the way the country is governed , are greatly emphasized by the political culture in Singapore . Finally , the Court expressed the view that if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence , another issue that will have to be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests . In this connection , Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation , whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously , or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation . The Chief Justice also suggested that the rationale in the Reynolds case might be given effect by continuing to find the defendant liable for defamation but reducing the amount of damages payable depending on how much care he or she took to ensure the accuracy of the information published . He noted : \" There is no reason why a defendant who has published a defamatory statement should be allowed to get off scot-free for injuring the plaintiff 's reputation simply because he has satisfied the ' responsible journalism ' test . \" = = = = Incitement to any offence = = = = Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution provides that the right to freedom of speech and expression may be restricted to provide against incitement to any offence . This ground has not yet been considered in a Singapore case . A number of statutory provisions prohibit incitement . Under section 107 ( a ) of the Penal Code , a person is said to abet the doing of a thing if he or she instigates someone to do that thing . If a person abets an offence , and as a result the act abetted is committed , the person is to be punished with the punishment provided for the offence . If the offence is not committed due to the abetment , and it is punishable by imprisonment , the abettor is to be imprisoned for up to a quarter of the maximum jail term of the offence , or may receive a fine , or both . If either the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant whose duty it was to prevent the offence from happening , the abettor may be imprisoned for up to half of the maximum jail term of the offence , or may be fined , or receive both penalties . However , if the offence abetted but not committed is punishable with death or life imprisonment , the abettor is liable to a penalty of up to seven years ' imprisonment , a fine , or both . If any hurt is caused as a result of the abetment , the abettor may be jailed up to 14 years and must also be fined . Under section 505 ( c ) of the Penal Code , it is an offence to make , publish or circulate any statement , rumour or report in written , electronic or other media with an intent to incite , or which is likely to incite , any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons . The penalty is imprisonment for up to three years , a fine , or both . No offence is committed if the person who made , published or circulated the statement had reasonable grounds for believing it was true , and did not intend to incite one community against another . = = = = Laws relating to labour or education = = = = Article 14 ( 3 ) provides that the right to form associations may also be restricted by any law relating to labour or education . The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations , while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act . Under the Education Act , it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled . Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university 's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies . = = = Other restrictions = = = Under Article 149 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons inside or outside Singapore : to cause , or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear , organized violence against persons or property ; to excite disaffection against the President or the Government ; to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or other classes of the population likely to cause violence ; to procure the alteration , otherwise than by lawful means , of anything by law established ; or which is prejudicial to the security of Singapore , any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action or any amendment to that law is valid even if it is inconsistent with specified fundamental liberties , including the rights to freedom of speech , assembly and association guaranteed by Article 14 . Article 149 thus shields the Internal Security Act from unconstitutionality . Among other things , the Act authorizes detention without trial to prevent persons from acting in a manner prejudicial to Singapore 's security or the maintenance of public order or essential services . = = Other provisions = = Section 5 of the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act , enacted pursuant to Article 63 of the Constitution , specifically provides for freedom of expression in Parliament in the following terms : There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament , and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court , commission of inquiry , committee of inquiry , tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament . This provision is based on one of the rights stated in the English Bill of Rights 1689 which reads : \" [ T ] he Freedome of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parlyament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parlyament . \" = = = Cases = = = Dow Jones Publishing Co .

                    "text": "Legitimate expectation in Singapore law = The doctrine of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights . In administrative law , a legitimate expectation generally arises when there has been a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual . To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness . The doctrine of legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts . Thus , where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority , the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken . Alternatively , an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right . The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority 's policy . This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach , which has been said not to apply in administrative law . The procedural dimension of the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been recognized by Singapore courts and , since 2013 , the substantive form of the doctrine as well . However , whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring legitimate expectation with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question . = = Development of the doctrine in the English courts = = = = = Legitimate expectation of a procedural right = = = The doctrine of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness . English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers . Generally , the courts will grant judicial review of an administrative decision based on an individual 's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers . The individual has to show that the representation was a clear and unambiguous promise , an established practice or a public announcement . This is largely a factual inquiry . The key idea is that under certain circumstances where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority , the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made . To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness . The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment . This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( the GCHQ case ) . This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , a government signals and intelligence department , who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions . The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom . The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters , even though it was not a rule . However , their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice . Such a representation can come in the form of a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision . Nonetheless , on the facts of the case , their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister 's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds . = = = Legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit = = = The English courts initially wavered in recognizing that an individual has a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit arising from a representation from the authorities . The notion of protecting a substantive legitimate expectation was espoused in the 1995 High Court decision in R. v. Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , ex parte Hamble ( Off-shore ) Fisheries Ltd . In that controversial case , Justice Stephen Sedley formulated the framework for legitimate expectations as the balance of the requirements of fairness against the decision-maker 's reasons to change the policy . This was in step with the development of the doctrine of proportionality as prescribed in the Treaty on European Union , and in European Court of Justice case law . The decision wove proportionality back into the fabric of judicial review in the UK under the banner of an expanding doctrine of \" fair administration \" despite the clear rejection of proportionality as a self-standing ground of review by the House of Lords in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Brind ( 1991 ) . In 1996 , the Court of Appeal opined in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Hargreaves that \" [ o ] n matters of substance ( as contrasted with procedure ) Wednesbury provides the correct test \" . In Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation ( 1947 ) , the High Court had introduced the idea of Wednesbury unreasonableness , that is , a public authority 's decision is unlawful if , although they have \" kept within the four corners of the matters they ought to consider , they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it \" . The inference to be made from ex parte Hargreaves was that where an applicant claimed to have a substantive expectation , it was not for the court to judge if that expectation should be protected vis-\u00e0-vis the broader public interest . The court should only intervene if the decision-maker 's exercise of its discretion satisfied the Wednesbury threshold . However , the courts ' role in protecting substantive legitimate expectations was clearly established by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority , ex parte Coughlan ( 1999 ) . The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her \" home for life \" . The Court granted the application for review on the ground that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying in the nursing home as promised by the local authority . It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations . Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned , courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to resile from it ( such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case ) . As regards substantive legitimate expectations , courts would decide whether cases lie \" ... in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field \" , or are those \" where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people , giving the promise or representation the character of a contract \" . In the first situation , the public authority \" is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation , giving it the weight it thinks right , but no more , before deciding whether to change course \" , and the court may only review the authority 's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness . On the other hand , when assessing a case in the second situation , the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power . The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy . A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice of Appeal John Laws . In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment , ex parte Begbie ( 1999 ) , he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not \" hermetically sealed \" , and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ( 2005 ) , he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach : [ A ] public body 's promise or practice as to future conduct may only be denied ... in circumstances where to do so is the public body 's legal duty , or is otherwise ... a proportionate response ( of which the court is the judge , or the last judge ) having regard to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the public interest . In Coughlan the view was expressed that the court will assess whether it is unfair for an authority to frustrate a legitimate expectation when the expectation is \" confined to one person or a few people , giving the promise or representation the character of a contract \" . In R. ( Bancoult ) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ( No. 2 ) ( 2007 ) , it was accepted that members of a group of close to a thousand or even up to several thousand people could have a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit following the government 's announcement of its intentions . Where a person convinces the court that his or her substantive legitimate expectation has been frustrated , the usual remedy is for the court to order that the public authority fulfil the expectation . However , in R. ( Bibi ) v. Newham London Borough Council ( 2001 ) it was held that when the decision in question is \" informed by social and political value judgments as to priorities of expenditure \" it is more appropriate for the authority to make the decision , and the court may order that the authority should merely reconsider its decision , taking into account the person 's substantive legitimate expectation . Coughlan has been criticized for allowing the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law , as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and , in a sense , usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government . This is arguably inconsistent with the court 's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law . = = Singapore = = = = = Legitimate expectation of a procedural right = = = Singaporean courts have accepted the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations . In Re Siah Mooi Guat ( 1988 ) , the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8 ( 3 ) ( k ) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled . As the applicant 's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected , the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash the decision of the Minister . One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights : the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act , and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision . In his judgment , Justice T. S. Sinnathuray considered Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs ( 1968 ) , decided by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales . He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore 's immigration laws were similar to those in the UK . In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason ; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no right to stay , and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay , for a day longer than the permitted period ; and that an alien 's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply . Furthermore , in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien 's permit to stay \" is revoked before the time limit expires , he ought ... to be given the opportunity of making representations : for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time \" . This argument was advanced by Siah 's counsel to persuade the court that \" an alien who is in possession of an entry permit which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and , therefore , he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure , if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely \" . The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an \" attractive \" one . However , he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had \" not been supported by any English authority \" , and that the position in Singapore is \" quite different \" . He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act , and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal . The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act . = = = Legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit = = = The existence of the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation in Singapore public law was accepted by the Court of Appeal in the case of Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor . In his judgment written on behalf of the Court , Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated that the idea behind the doctrine is that certain \" expectations could , in suitable circumstances , be deserving of protection , even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right \" . Nonetheless , the Court stated : \" [ W ] e were not concerned with judicial review , nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment . That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here . \" Other decided cases also do not indicate whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation will be developed in the way it has been developed in the UK . In Siah Mooi Guat , another argument the applicant raised was that she had a legitimate expectation to continue to reside in Singapore until the expiry of her re-entry permit . Sinnathuray J. distinguished Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu ( 1983 ) , a Privy Council case on appeal from Hong Kong , from the case at hand . In the Privy Council case there had been an express promise made to Ng by the Government of Hong Kong which had created a substantive legitimate expectation . In the present case , no promise had been made to be applicant that her stay in Singapore was to be conditioned by any considerations other than those provided in the Immigration Act and related regulations . No substantive legitimate expectation arose in the applicant 's favour , following the dictum of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in the GCHQ case that legitimate expectation arises \" either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue \" . Thus , the judge did not discuss the detailed legal rules to be applied to determine when an aggrieved person may be said to have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right . In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority ( 2009 ) , the applicant and her husband owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop . In 2002 , the Urban Redevelopment Authority ( URA ) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses . The URA rejected the applicant 's redevelopment application on the basis of the circular . Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved . The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation . It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith 's Judicial Review ( 6th ed . , 2007 ) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created : the public body 's representation must be clear , unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification ; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker ; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority ; and applicable to the applicant , who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply . The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made . The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right , but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her , it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore . In UDL Marine ( Singapore ) Pte . Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. ( 2011 ) , the High Court \" entertain [ ed ] some doubt \" as to whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore law , but did not discuss the matter further as neither the respondent nor the Attorney-General had made submissions on the issue . Subsequently , however , in Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte . Ltd. v. Singapore Land Authority ( 2013 ) a differently constituted High Court held that substantive legitimate expectation should be recognized as a ground of judicial review if the following conditions are satisfied : ( a ) The applicant must prove that the statement or representation made by the public authority was unequivocal and unqualified ; ( i ) if the statement or representation is open to more than one natural interpretation , the interpretation applied by the public authority will be adopted ; and ( ii ) the presence of a disclaimer or non-reliance clause would cause the statement or representation to be qualified . ( b ) The applicant must prove the statement or representation was made by someone with actual or ostensible authority to do so on behalf of the public authority . ( c ) The applicant must prove that the statement or representation was made to him or to a class of persons to which he clearly belongs . ( d ) The applicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the statement or representation in the circumstances of his case : ( i ) if the applicant knew that the statement or representation was made in error and chose to capitalise on the error , he will not be entitled to any relief ; ( ii ) similarly , if he suspected that the statement or representation was made in error and chose not to seek clarification when he could have done so , he will not be entitled to any relief ; ( iii ) if there is reason and opportunity to make enquiries and the applicant did not , he will not be entitled to any relief . ( e ) The applicant must prove that he did rely on the statement or representation and that he suffered a detriment as a result . ( f ) Even if all the above requirements are met , the court should nevertheless not grant relief if : ( i ) giving effect to the statement or representation will result in a breach of the law or the State \u2019 s international obligations ; ( ii ) giving effect to the statement or representation will infringe the accrued rights of some member of the public ; ( iii ) the public authority can show an overriding national or public interest which justifies the frustration of the applicant 's expectation . = = Assessment = = Academics have expressed scepticism as to whether the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights . Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights . Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority , since the court is only concerned with the manner in which the decision was made and not whether the decision was fair . Thus , the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy . Conversely , as Mark Elliot posits , giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers . The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest . Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision . Such interference with the public authority 's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function . On the other hand , in Coughlan the Court of Appeal cited the following passage from R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners , ex parte MFK Underwriting Agents Ltd . ( 1990 ) : If a public authority so conducts itself as to create a legitimate expectation that a certain course will be followed it would often be unfair if the authority were permitted to follow a different course to the detriment of one who entertained the expectation , particularly if he acted on it . ... The doctrine of legitimate expectation is rooted in fairness . The Court of Appeal emphasized that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness . Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive 's policy-making powers , as it is for public authorities , acting within their statutory powers , to adopt or change policies . The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review . On the other hand , it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority 's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power . = = = Cases = = = = = = = Singapore = = = = Re Siah Mooi Guat [ 1988 ] 2 S.L.R.

It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance , a type of general search warrant issued by the British government and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America . The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison , along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights , in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution . Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28 , 1789 . By December 15 , 1791 , the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it . On March 1 , 1792 , Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment . Because the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to the states , and federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation 's history , there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century . The amendment was held to apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) . Under the Fourth Amendment , search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court , usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions : what government activities constitute \" search \" and \" seizure \" ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . Early court decisions limited the amendment 's scope to a law enforcement officer 's physical intrusion onto private property , but with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) , the Supreme Court held that its protections , such as the warrant requirement , extend to the privacy of individuals as well as physical locations . Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most search and seizure activities , but the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches , motor vehicle searches , evidence in plain view , exigent circumstances , border searches , and other situations . The exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced . Established in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) , this rule holds that evidence obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible at criminal trials . Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal search may also be inadmissible as \" fruit of the poisonous tree , \" unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means . = = Text = = The amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows : The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . = = Background = = = = = English law = = = Like many other areas of American law , the Fourth Amendment finds its roots in English legal doctrine . Sir Edward Coke , in Semayne 's case ( 1604 ) , famously stated : \" The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress , as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose . \" Semayne 's Case acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects ' dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained . The 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state officers , who , using general warrants , conducted raids in search of materials relating to John Wilkes 's publications attacking both government policies and the King himself . The most famous of these cases involved John Entick , whose home was forcibly entered by the King 's Messenger Nathan Carrington , along with others , pursuant to a warrant issued by George Montagu-Dunk , 2nd Earl of Halifax authorizing them \" to make strict and diligent search for ... the author , or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers entitled , ' The Monitor or British Freeholder , No 257 , 357 , 358 , 360 , 373 , 376 , 378 , and 380 , ' \" and seized printed charts , pamphlets and other materials . Entick filed suit in Entick v Carrington , argued before the Court of King 's Bench in 1765 . Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden ruled that both the search and the seizure was unlawful , as the warrant authorized the seizure of all of Entick 's papers \u2014 not just the criminal ones \u2014 and as the warrant lacked probable cause to even justify the search . By holding that \" [ O ] ur law holds the property of every man so sacred , that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour 's close without his leave \" , Entick established the English precedent that the executive is limited in intruding on private property by common law . = = = Colonial America = = = Homes in Colonial America , on the other hand , did not enjoy the same sanctity as their British counterparts , because legislation had been explicitly written so as to enable enforcement of British revenue-gathering policies on customs ; until 1750 , in fact , the only type of warrant defined in the handbooks for justices of the peace was the general warrant . During what scholar William Cuddihy called the \" colonial epidemic of general searches \" , the authorities possessed almost unlimited power to search for anything at any time , with very little oversight . In 1756 , the colony of Massachusetts enacted legislation that barred the use of general warrants . This represented the first law in American history curtailing the use of seizure power . Its creation largely stemmed from the great public outcry over the Excise Act of 1754 , which gave tax collectors unlimited powers to interrogate colonists concerning their use of goods subject to customs . The act also permitted the use of a general warrant known as a writ of assistance , allowing tax collectors to search the homes of colonists and seize \" prohibited and uncustomed \" goods . A crisis erupted over the writs of assistance on December 27 , 1760 when the news of King George II 's death on October 23 arrived in Boston . All writs automatically expired six months after the death of the King and would have had to be re-issued by George III , the new king , to remain valid . In mid-January 1761 , a group of over 50 merchants represented by James Otis petitioned the court to have hearings on the issue . During the five-hour hearing on February 23 , 1761 , Otis vehemently denounced British colonial policies , including their sanction of general warrants and writs of assistance . However , the court ruled against Otis . Future US President John Adams , who was present in the courtroom when Otis spoke , viewed these events as \" the spark in which originated the American Revolution . \" Because of the name he had made for himself in attacking the writs , Otis was elected to the Massachusetts colonial legislature and helped pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be \" granted by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any officer of the customs \" and barring all other writs . The governor overturned the legislation , finding it contrary to English law and parliamentary sovereignty . Seeing the danger general warrants presented , the Virginia Declaration of Rights ( 1776 ) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants . This prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment : That general warrants , whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed , or to seize any person or persons not named , or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence , are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted . Article XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights , written by John Adams and enacted in 1780 as part of the Massachusetts Constitution , added the requirement that all searches must be \" reasonable \" and served as another basis for the language of the Fourth Amendment : Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches , and seizures of his person , his houses , his papers , and all his possessions . All warrants , therefore , are contrary to this right , if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation ; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer , to make search in suspected places , or to arrest one or more suspected persons , or to seize their property , be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search , arrest , or seizure : and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases , and with the formalities , prescribed by the laws . By 1784 , eight state constitutions contained a provision against general warrants . = = Proposal and ratification = = After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation , a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17 , 1787 , featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes . George Mason , a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia 's Declaration of Rights , proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included . Other delegates \u2014 including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison \u2014 disagreed , arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other , unnamed rights were unprotected . After a brief debate , Mason 's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations . For the constitution to be ratified , however , nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions . Opposition to ratification ( \" Anti-Federalism \" ) was partly based on the Constitution 's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties . Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification ( including Virginia , Massachusetts , and New York ) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights . Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches . In the 1st United States Congress , following the state legislatures ' request , James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689 , including an amendment requiring probable cause for government searches . Congress reduced Madison 's proposed twenty amendments to twelve , and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25 , 1789 . By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification , opinions had shifted in both parties . Many Federalists , who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights , now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists ' most effective criticism . Many Anti-Federalists , in contrast , now opposed it , realizing that the Bill 's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention , which they desired . Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution , such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation , intact . On November 20 , 1789 , New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments , including the Fourth . On December 19 , 1789 , December 22 , 1789 , and January 19 , 1790 , respectively , Maryland , North Carolina , and South Carolina ratified all twelve amendments . On January 25 and 28 , 1790 , respectively , New Hampshire and Delaware ratified eleven of the Bill 's twelve amendments , including the Fourth . This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten , but the process stalled in other states : Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify , while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments , but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so . ( All three states would later ratify the Bill of Rights for sesquicentennial celebrations in 1939 . ) In February through June of 1790 , New York , Pennsylvania , and Rhode Island each ratified eleven of the amendments , including the Fourth . Virginia initially postponed its debate , but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791 , the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven . Vermont ratified on November 3 , 1791 , approving all twelve amendments , and Virginia finally followed on December 15 , 1791 . Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1 , 1792 . = = Applicability = = The Bill of Rights originally only restricted the federal government , and went through a long initial phase of \" judicial dormancy \" ; in the words of historian Gordon S. Wood , \" After ratification , most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution . \" Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act were passed . As federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as narcotics , more questions about the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court . The U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing \" the privacy , dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government , without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function . \" In Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues : what government activities constitute \" search \" and \" seizure \" ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . The Fourth Amendment typically requires \" a neutral and detached authority interposed between the police and the public , \" and it is offended by \" general warrants \" and laws that allows searches to be conducted \" indiscriminately and without regard to their connection with [ a ] crime under investigation . \" , for the \" basic purpose of the Fourth Amendment , which is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth , through its prohibition of \" unreasonable \" searches and seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials . \" The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant , because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and \" searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable . \" In order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable , it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person ( usually a law enforcement officer ) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court . The Supreme Court further held in Chandler v. Miller ( 1997 ) : \" To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment , a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . But particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on ' special needs , beyond the normal need for law enforcement . ' ... When such ' special needs ' are alleged , courts must undertake a context-specific inquiry , examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties . \" The amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures , but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government . In Ontario v. Quon ( 2010 ) , the Court held the amendment to also apply to the government when acting as an employer , ruling that a government could search a police officer 's text messages that were sent over that government 's pager . = = = Search = = = One threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a \" search \" has occurred . Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on a citizen 's property rights \u2014 that is , when the government physically intrudes on \" persons , houses , papers , or effects \" for the purpose of obtaining information , a \" search \" within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred . Early 20th-century Court decisions , such as Olmstead v. United States ( 1928 ) , held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of physical intrusion , but not to other forms of police surveillance ( e.g. , wiretaps ) . In Silverman v. United States ( 1961 ) , the Court stated of the amendment that \" at the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion . \" Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) . In Katz , the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual 's right to privacy , and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass . While there was no physical intrusion into the booth , the Court reasoned that : 1 ) Katz , by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him , had exhibited his expectation that \" the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world \" ; and 2 ) society believes that his expectation was reasonable . Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that \" the Fourth Amendment protects people , not places \" . A \" search \" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person 's \" reasonable expectation of privacy . \" Katz 's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government 's intrusion , though electronic rather than physical , was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment , and thus necessitated a warrant . The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment , and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed . This decision in Katz was later developed into the now commonly used two-prong test , adopted in Smith v. Maryland ( 1979 ) , for determining whether the Fourth Amendment is applicable in a given circumstance : a person \" has exhibited an actual ( subjective ) expectation of privacy \" ; and society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is ( objectively ) reasonable . The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties . In Smith , the Court held individuals have no \" legitimate expectation of privacy \" regarding the telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that information to telephone companies when they dial a number . Following Katz , the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy , but in United States v. Jones ( 2012 ) , the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law , but rather , has supplemented it . In Jones , law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car 's exterior without Jones ' knowledge or consent . The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car , and so had a property interest in the car . Therefore , since the intrusion on the vehicle \u2014 a common law trespass \u2014 was for the purpose of obtaining information , the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment . The Court used similar \" trespass \" reasoning in Florida v. Jardines ( 2013 ) , to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search . In certain situations , law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity , even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest . Under Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) , law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances . In Terry , the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses \" unusual conduct \" that leads that officer to reasonably believe \" that criminal activity may be afoot \" , that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others , the officer may conduct a \" pat-down search \" ( or \" frisk \" ) to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon . This detention and search is known as a Terry stop . To conduct a frisk , officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which , taken together with rational inferences from those facts , reasonably warrant their actions . As established in Florida v. Royer ( 1983 ) , such a search must be temporary , and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop ( e.g. , officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car , cannot , after confirming that it is not stolen , compel the person to answer questions about anything else , such as the possession of contraband ) . = = = Seizure = = = The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person , person 's home ( including its curtilage ) or personal property without a warrant . A seizure of property occurs when there is \" some meaningful interference with an individual 's possessory interests in that property \" , such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence , or when they participate in an eviction . The amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure of persons , including a brief detention . A seizure does not occur just because the government questions an individual in a public place . The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained . The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable , objective grounds , with few exceptions . His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds . In United States v. Mendenhall ( 1980 ) , the Court held that a person is seized only when , by means of physical force or show of authority , his freedom of movement is restrained and , in the circumstances surrounding the incident , a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave . In Florida v. Bostick ( 1991 ) , the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required , the police contact is a \" citizen encounter \" that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment . If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government , there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person 's privacy under the Fourth Amendment . When a person is arrested and taken into police custody , he has been seized ( i.e. , a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car would not think they were free to leave ) . A person subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand , has been seized , but is not \" arrested \" because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal arrest . If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior , a law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity , provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case . A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment , so long as the arresting officer has probable cause . In Maryland v. King ( 2013 ) , the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes , along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain . = = = = Exceptions = = = = The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion , with a few exceptions . In Delaware v. Prouse ( 1979 ) , the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver 's license and the registration of the automobile , unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered , or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law . Where society 's need is great , no other effective means of meeting the need is available , and intrusion on people 's privacy is minimal , certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists . In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints . In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz ( 1990 ) , the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints . In Illinois v. Lidster ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints . However , in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond ( 2000 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed . = = = Warrant = = = Under the Fourth Amendment , law enforcement must receive written permission from a court of law , or otherwise qualified magistrate , to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity . A court grants permission by issuing a writ known as a warrant . A search or seizure is generally unreasonable and unconstitutional if conducted without a valid warrant and the police must obtain a warrant whenever practicable . Searches and seizures without a warrant are not considered unreasonable if one of the specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement applies . These exceptions apply \" [ o ] nly in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs , beyond the normal need for law enforcement , make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable . \" In these situations where the warrant requirement doesn 't apply a search or seizure nonetheless must be justified by some individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . However , the U.S. Supreme Court carved out an exception to the requirement of individualized suspicion . It ruled that , \" In limited circumstances , where the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion \" a search [ or seizure ] would still be reasonable . = = = Probable cause = = = The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search . The government has a probable cause to make an arrest when \" the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information \" would lead a prudent person to believe that the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime . Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made . Evidence obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the arrest . When police conduct a search , the amendment requires that the warrant establish probable cause to believe that the search will uncover criminal activity or contraband . They must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary . In Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) , the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible , common-sense standard . To that end , the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States ( 1925 ) that the term probable cause means \" less than evidence that would justify condemnation \" , reiterating Carroll 's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \" warrant a man of reasonable caution \" in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime . It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false . A \" practical , non-technical \" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required . In Illinois v. Gates ( 1983 ) , the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the \" totality of the circumstances . \" = = Exceptions to the warrant requirement = = = = = Consent = = = If a party gives consent to a search , a warrant is not required . There are exceptions and complications to the rule , including the scope of the consent given , whether the consent is voluntarily given , and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another 's property . In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte ( 1973 ) , the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search . This contrasts with Fifth Amendment rights , which cannot be relinquished without an explicit Miranda warning from police . The Court stated in United States v. Matlock ( 1974 ) that a third party co-occupant could give consent for a search without violating a suspect 's Fourth Amendment rights . Per the Court 's ruling in Illinois v. Rodriguez ( 1990 ) , a consent search is still considered valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an \" apparent authority \" , even if that party is later discovered to not have authority over the property in question . = = = Plain view and open fields = = = According to the plain view doctrine as defined in Coolidge v. New Hampshire ( 1971 ) , if an officer is lawfully present , he may seize objects that are in \" plain view \" . However , the officer must have had probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband . Similarly , \" open fields \" such as pastures , open water , and woods may be searched without a warrant , on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy . The doctrine was first articulated by the Court in Hester v. United States ( 1924 ) , which stated that \" the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their ' persons , houses , papers , and effects , ' is not extended to the open fields . \" In Oliver v. United States ( 1984 ) , the police ignored a \" no trespassing \" sign and a fence , trespassed onto the suspect 's land without a warrant , followed a path for hundreds of feet , and discovered a field of marijuana . The Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken place , because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open field : open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance . There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities , such as the cultivation of crops , that occur in open fields . While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment , the curtilage , or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home , is protected . Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person 's home ( unlike a person 's open fields ) under the Fourth Amendment . The curtilage is \" intimately linked to the home , both physically and psychologically , \" and is where \" privacy expectations are most heightened . \" However , courts have held aerial surveillance of curtilage not to be included in the protections from unwarranted search so long as the airspace above the curtilage is generally accessible by the public . An area is curtilage if it \" harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man 's home and the privacies of life . \" Courts make this determination by examining \" whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home , the nature of the uses to which the area is put , and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by . \" The Court has acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is typically treated as an invitation , or license , to the public to approach the front door of the home to deliver mail , sell goods , solicit for charities , etc . This license extends to the police , who have the right to try engaging a home 's occupant in a \" knock and talk \" for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant . However , they cannot bring a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home without either a warrant or consent of the homeowner or resident . = = = Exigent circumstance = = = Law enforcement officers may also conduct warrantless searches in several types of exigent circumstances where obtaining a warrant is dangerous or impractical . One example is the Terry stop , which allows police to frisk suspects for weapons . The Court also allowed a search of arrested persons in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) to preserve evidence that might otherwise be destroyed and to ensure suspects were disarmed . In Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) , the Court ruled that law enforcement officers could search a vehicle that they suspected of carrying contraband without a warrant . The Court allowed blood to be drawn without a warrant from drunk-driving suspects in Schmerber v. California ( 1966 ) on the grounds that the time to obtain a warrant would allow a suspect 's blood alcohol content to reduce , although this was later modified by Missouri v. McNeely ( 2013 ) . Warden v. Hayden ( 1967 ) provided an exception to the warrant requirement if officers were in \" hot pursuit \" of a suspect . = = = Motor vehicle = = = The Supreme Court has held that individuals in automobiles have a reduced expectation of privacy , because vehicles generally do not serve as residences or repositories of personal effects . Vehicles may not be randomly stopped and searched ; there must be probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity . Items in plain view may be seized ; areas that could potentially hide weapons may also be searched . With probable cause to believe evidence is present , police officers may search any area in the vehicle . However , they may not extend the search to the vehicle 's passengers without probable cause to search those passengers or consent from the passengers . In Arizona v. Gant ( 2009 ) , the Court ruled that a law enforcement officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an arrest of an occupant of that vehicle , unless 1 ) at the time of the search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2 ) police officers have reason to believe that evidence for the crime for which the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle . = = = Searches incident to a lawful arrest = = = A common law rule from Great Britain permits searches incident to an arrest without a warrant . This rule has been applied in American law , and has a lengthy common law history . The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1 . ) from destroying evidence or 2 . ) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \" both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply \" , when \" there is no possibility \" that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence . In Trupiano v. United States ( 1948 ) , the Supreme Court held that \" a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been considered to be a strictly limited right . It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest . But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest . \" In United States v. Rabinowitz ( 1950 ) , the Court reversed Trupiano , holding instead that the officers ' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest . Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the \" immediate control \" of the arrestee could be searched , but it did not define the term . In deciding Chimel v. California ( 1969 ) , the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions . It held that when an arrest is made , it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence . However , in Riley v. California ( 2014 ) , the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee 's cellular phone . The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to \" modern cellphones , which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy , \" and noted that US citizens ' cellphones today typically contain \" a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives \u2014 from the mundane to the intimate . \" = = = Border search exception = = = Searches conducted at the United States border or the equivalent of the border ( such as an international airport ) may be conducted without a warrant or probable cause subject to the border search exception . Most border searches may be conducted entirely at random , without any level of suspicion , pursuant to U.S. Customs and Border Protection plenary search authority . However , searches that intrude upon a traveler 's personal dignity and privacy interests , such as strip and body cavity searches , must be supported by \" reasonable suspicion . \" The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth circuits have ruled that information on a traveler 's electronic materials , including personal files on a laptop computer , may be searched at random , without suspicion . = = = Foreign intelligence surveillance = = = The Supreme Court decision in United States v. U.S. District Court ( 1972 ) left open the possibility for a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause . Three United States Courts of Appeals have recognized a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause , but tied it to certain requirements . The exception to the Fourth Amendment was formally recognized by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review in its 2008 In re Directives decision . The lower court held that , \" a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment 's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be located outside the United States . \" Despite the foregoing citation the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures nonetheless apply to the contents of all communications , whatever the means , because , \" a person 's private communications are akin to personal papers . \" To protect the telecommunication carriers cooperating with the US government from legal action , the Congress passed a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit this type of surveillance . = = = Other exceptions = = = In New Jersey v. T. L. O. ( 1985 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that searches in public schools do not require warrants , as long as the searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity . However , in Safford Unified School District v. Redding ( 2009 ) , the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student . Similarly , in Samson v. California ( 2006 ) , the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds . Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause . = = Exclusionary rule = = One way courts enforce the Fourth Amendment is through the use of the exclusionary rule . The rule provides that evidence obtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally not admissible by the prosecution during the defendant 's criminal trial . The Court stated in Elkins v. United States ( 1960 ) that the rule 's function \" is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it . \" The Court adopted the exclusionary rule in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) , prior to which all evidence , no matter how seized , could be admitted in court . In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States ( 1920 ) and Nardone v. United States ( 1939 ) , the Court ruled that leads or other evidence resulting from illegally obtained evidence are also inadmissible in trials . Justice Felix Frankfurter described this secondary evidence in the Nardone decision as the \" fruit of the poisonous tree \" . The Supreme Court rejected incorporating the exclusionary rule by way of the Fourteenth Amendment in Wolf v. Colorado ( 1949 ) , but Wolf was explicitly overruled in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) , making the Fourth Amendment ( including the exclusionary rule ) applicable in state proceedings . The exclusionary rule and its effectiveness have often been controversial , particularly since its 1961 application to state proceedings . Critics charge that the rule hampers police investigation and can result in freeing guilty parties convicted on reliable evidence ; other critics state that the rule has not been successful in deterring illegal police searches . Proponents argue that the number of criminal convictions overturned under the rule has been minimal and that no other effective mechanism exists to enforce the Fourth Amendment . In 1982 , California passed a \" Victim 's Bill of Rights \" containing a provision to repeal the exclusionary rule ; though the bill could not affect federally mandated rights under the Fourth Amendment , it blocked the state courts from expanding these protections further . = = = Limitations = = = Starting with United States v. Calandra ( 1974 ) , the Supreme Court has repeatedly limited the exclusionary rule . The Court in Calandra ruled that grand juries may use illegally obtained evidence when questioning witnesses , because \" the damage to that institution from the unprecedented extension of the exclusionary rule outweighs the benefit of any possible incremental deterrent effect . \" Explaining the purpose of the rule , the Court said that the rule \" is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect , rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved . \" Several cases in 1984 further restricted the exclusionary rule : In United States v. Leon , the Court established the \" good faith \" exception to the rule , ruling that evidence seized by officers reasonably relying on a warrant was still admissible , even though the warrant was later found to be defective , unless an officer dishonestly or recklessly prepared an affidavit to seek a warrant , the issuing magistrate abandoned his neutrality , or the warrant lacked sufficient particularity . The Court determined in Nix v. Williams that \" fruit of the poisonous tree \" evidence could still be introduced if a prosecutor could demonstrate that it would have been an \" inevitable discovery \" of legitimate investigation . In Segura v. United States , the Court ruled that evidence illegally found without a search warrant is admissible if the evidence is later found and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal search . In Arizona v. Evans ( 1995 ) and Herring v. United States ( 2009 ) , the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence found due to negligence regarding a government database , as long as the arresting police officer relied on that database in \" good faith \" and the negligence was not pervasive . In Davis v. United States ( 2011 ) , the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to a Fourth Amendment violation resulting from a reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent . In Utah v. Strieff ( 2016 ) , the Court ruled that evidence obtained from an unlawful police stop would not be excluded from court when the link between the stop and the evidence \u2019 s discovery was \u201c attenuated \u201d by the discovery of an outstanding warrant during the stop . The Supreme Court has also held the exclusionary rule to not apply in the following circumstances : evidence illegally seized by a \" private actor \" ( i.e. , not a governmental employee ) tax hearings evidence collected by U.S. Customs agents deportation hearings evidence seized by probation or parole officers probation or parole revocation hearings",

The clause says that the accused shall be entitled to a jury \" of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law \" . The Vicinage Clause limits the vicinity of criminal jury selection to both the state and the federal judicial district where the crime has been committed whereas the venue provision of Article Three of the United States Constitution regulates the location of the actual trial . The Vicinage clause has its roots in medieval English criminal procedure , the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution . The clause is one of the few constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts , along with the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and ( maybe ) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment . The Clause has led to very little litigation , in part because of its overlap ( as a practical matter ) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure . Further , with the exception of the District of Wyoming , which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana ( see below ) , no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states ( although the short-lived District of Potomac once did ) . = = Background = = = = = English law during the Colonial period = = = The Oxford English Dictionary defines \" vicinage \" as \" A number of places lying near to each other taken collectively ; an area extending to a limited distance round a particular spot ; a neighbourhood . \" The OED cites Thomas Fuller 's Church History ( 1655 ) : \" King Ethelred . . . began the tryal of Causes by a Jury of twelve men to be chosen out of the Vicenage . \" According to Blackstone , in medieval England , the \" vicinage of the jury \" referred to a jury drawn from the relevant county . A 1543 statute of Henry VIII of England permits treason committed outside the \" realm \" to be tried \" before such commissioners , and in such shire of the realm , as shall be assigned by the King 's majesty 's commission . \" Parliament renewed the statute in 1769 . This law was used to try colonists accused of treason in England . A 1772 statute of George III of the United Kingdom permits destruction of dockyards , magazines , ships , ammunition , and supplies committed outside the \" realm \" to be tried in any \" shire or county within this realm . \" A 1772 statute permitted capital crimes committed in Massachusetts to be tried in England or a neighboring province if \" an indifferent trial cannot be had within \" Massachusetts . = = = Protests from the Revolutionary period = = = The Virginia House of Burgesses condemned the renewal of the treason law on May 16 , 1769 in the Virginia Resolves : [ A ] ll Trials for Treason , Misprison for Treason , and for any Felony or Crime whatsoever , committed and done in this his Majesty 's said Colony and Dominion , by any Person or Persons residing therein , ought of right to be had , and conducted in and before his Majesty 's Courts , held within the said Colony , according to the fixed and known Course of Proceedings ; and that the seizing of any Person or Persons , residing in this Colony , suspected of any Crime whatsoever , committed therein , and sending such Person or Persons to Places beyond the Sea , to be tried , is highly derogatory of the Rights of British subjects . . . . The same resolution referred to the \" inestimable Privilege of being tried by a Jury from the Vicinage . \" The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress adopted on October 14 , 1774 , resolved : That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England , and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage , according to the course of that law . On October 26 , 1774 , the Continental Congress approved an address to the people of Quebec , drafted by Thomas Cushing , Richard Henry Lee , and John Dickinson , arguing that : [ One ] great right is that of trial by jury . This provides , that neither life , liberty nor property , can be taken from the possessor , until twelve of his unexceptionable countrymen and peers of his vicinage , who from that neighbourhood may reasonably be supposed to be acquainted with his character , and the characters of the witnesses . . . . The United States Declaration of Independence ( 1776 ) accuses King George III of \" transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences . \" = = = Drafting of the Constitution = = = The New Jersey Plan contained a provision that : \" [ N ] o person shall be liable to be tried for any criminal offense , committed within any of the United States , in any other state than that wherein the offense shall be committed . . . . \" The proposals of Alexander Hamilton and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were similar . The Committee of Detail and Committee of the Whole amended this language and included it within Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three . Article III provides : \" The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed . \" This provision received almost no debate in the Constitutional Convention . The omission of a vicinage right from the United States Constitution was among the objections of the Anti-federalists to the ratification of the Constitution . James Madison explained the omission of a vicinage clause in the Virginia Ratifying Convention as follows : It was objected yesterday , that there was no provision for a jury from the vicinage . If it could have been done with safety , it would not have been opposed . It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county . Suppose a rebellion in a whole district , would it not be impossible to get a jury ? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America . There are deviations of it in England : yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence , than have taken place there for a long time , though it be left to the legislative discretion . It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from , yet in some cases it is necessary . It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances . This is a complete and satisfactory answer . Virginia ratified the Constitution , with a proviso that a Bill of Rights , including a right to \" trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage , \" be added by amendment . North Carolina adopted the same proviso as Virginia , but refused to ratify the Constitution in its absence . New York and Rhode Island ratified the constitution with similar provisos as Virginia ( but , in the case of Rhode Island , the Sixth Amendment had already been sent to the states for ratification ) . The ratifying provisos of Massachusetts did not include a vicinage right ; a proviso including a vicinage right was considered and rejected in Pennsylvania . = = Drafting of the Clause = = = = = House = = = James Madison 's ( A-VA ) original draft of the jury provision of the Sixth Amendment provided : The trial of all crimes ( except in cases of impeachment , and cases arising in the land or naval forces , or the militia when on actual service , in time of war or public danger ) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage , with the requisite of unanimity for conviction , of the right of challenge , and other accustomed requisites . . . provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy , or in which a general insurrection may prevail , the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same state , as near as may be to the seat of the offence . Madison intended this language to replace Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three , rather than be appended to the Constitution . The Committee of Eleven of the House amended Madison 's language as follows : The trial of all crimes ( except in cases of impeachment , and in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia when on actual service in the time of war , or public danger , ) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage , with the requisite of unanimity for conviction , the right of challenge , and other accustomed requisites . . . . [ B ] ut if a crime be committed in a place in the possession of an enemy , or in which an insurrection may prevail , the indictment and trial may by law be authorized in some other place within the same State ; and if it be committed in a place not within a state , the indictment and trial may be at such place or places as the law may have directed . Aedanus Burke ( A-SC ) proposed that \" vicinage \" be replaced by \" district or county in which the offence has been committed . \" Richard Henry Lee ( A-VA ) argued that \" vicinage \" was better , \" it being a term well understood by every gentleman of legal knowledge . \" Rep. Burke 's amendment was defeated . As amended by the Committee of Eleven , this language passed the House . The Committee of Three , undertaking the task of transforming the amendments to the body of the Constitution into a separate Bill of Rights , moved the language to Article X and deleted the language concerning crimes not committed within a state . = = = Senate = = = The Senate debated the Bill of Rights from September 2 to September 9 and returned a version to the House on September 10 . The Senate deleted every clause from the House version of the Sixth Amendment , with the exception of the grand jury indictment clause . A motion to restore the House wording failed . Little is known about the Senate debate due to the illness of Senator Samuel Maclay whose journal is a key source for the proceedings of the Senate during the first Congress . A September 14 , 1789 letter from Madison to Edmund Pendleton reports : The Senate have sent back the plan of amendments with some alternations , which strike , in my opinion , at the most salutary articles . In many of the States , juries , even in criminal cases , are taken from the State at large ; in others , from districts of considerable extent ; in very few from the County alone . Hence a dislike to the restraint with respect to vicinage , which has produced a negative on that clause . . . . Several others have had a similar fate . = = = Conference Committee = = = The altered form in which the Senate returned the Bill of Rights to the House lead to a conference committee composed of members of both bodies . The members of the committee from the House proposed that the jury simply be defined as comporting with \" the accustomed requisites . \" The members of the committee from the Senate were opposed to constitutionalizing the vicinage requirement , believing that the vicinage provisions of the first Judiciary Act ( already being debate ) were sufficient . A second letter from Madison to Pendleton recounts that the Senators were inflexible in opposing a definition of the locality of Juries . The vicinage they contend is either too vague or too strict a term ; too vague if depending on limits to be fixed by the pleasure of the law , too strict if limited to the county . It was proposed to insert after the word Juries , \" with the accustomed requisites , \" leaving the definition to be construed according to the judgment of professional men . Even this could not be obtained . The truth is that in most of the States the practice is different , and hence the irreconcilable difference of ideas on the subject . In most States , jurors are drawn from the whole body of the community indiscriminately ; in others , from large districts comprehending a number of Counties ; and in a few only from a single County . The Senate suppose , also , that the provision for vicinage in the Judiciary bill will sufficiently quiet the fears which called for an amendment on this point . The committee adopted the version that passed Congress and was ratified by the states : In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . . = = Interpretation = = \" Jury ... \" The Vicinage Clause applies only to petit juries , not grand juries ( although some cases finding no violation of the Clause have assumed without deciding that the Clause does apply to grand juries ) . \" ... of the State and district ... \" In murder cases arising from the Indian Territory , Navassa Island , and the No Man 's Land of the Oklahoma Panhandle , the Supreme Court has held that the Clause places no limits on the prosecution of crimes committed outside the territory of a state . The Clause does not require a jury drawn from the judicial division ( a subset of a federal judicial district ) within which the crime occurred ; rather , the jury may be drawn from any division of the district . Nor does the Clause prevent the jury from being drawn solely from a judicial division , or any other subset of a judicial district ( rather than the entire judicial district ) . \" ... wherein the crime shall have been committed , ... \" The \" wherein the crime shall have been committed \" language of the clause is in parallel with the venue provision of Article Three \u2014 \" where the said Crimes shall have been committed . \" \u2014 and with Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \u2014 \" where the offense was committed . \" The three provisions have been interpreted in tandem to refer to the locus delicti of the offense . \" ... which district shall have been previously ascertained by law \" Lower courts are split on whether the Clause requires that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence at the time the crime was committed . Some courts have held that it does . Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial . Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district , but retains the former configuration for past offenses . = = = Incorporation = = = The Third , Fifth , and Sixth Circuits have held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . = = = The perfect crime ? = = = Professor Brian C. Kalt of Michigan State University College of Law argues that the Vicinage Clause may permit the commission of the \" perfect crime \" in the portion of Yellowstone National Park within the state of Idaho because the entire park is within the District of Wyoming and the Idaho portion of the park has no residents ( and that a less perfect crime could be committed in the lightly populated Montana portion of the park ) . Kalt argues that two arguments the government might make in favor of prosecution would be unsuccessful : that the Idaho portion of the park is not part of a state and that the judicial district could be changed after the crime . However , Kalt argues that the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial strategies that would at least partially close this loophole . First , the government might be able to charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park ( for example , if the defendant ( s ) conspired elsewhere ) . Second , the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less , to which the jury right does not attach . Third , the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime . Fourth , the government might argue for a purposive , rather than textualist , interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause . Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice . This same problem also was cited by the Nevada Legislature as a reason to dissolve Bullfrog County , Nevada , a short-lived county specially created in 1987 for purposes of shifting federal transfer payments related to the creation of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility directly to the state treasury . = = Similar provisions in state constitutions = = Before the adoption of the federal Constitution , only two state constitutions provided an explicit vicinage right . The Virginia Constitution of 1776 provided : \" in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to . . . an impartial jury of twelve men of his vicinage . \" The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 read similarly , but said \" county \" instead of \" vicinage \" ; it was amended in 1790 to say \" vicinage . \" By contrast , four of the original thirteen state constitutions contained explicit criminal venue provisions . New Hampshire ( 1784 ) and Georgia ( 1777 and 1789 ) required crimes to be tried in the county where committed . Maryland ( 1776 ) and Massachusetts ( 1780 ) contained similar provisions . In Coleman 's Appeal ( 1874 ) , the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that \" a man shall only be liable to be called on to answer for civil wrongs in the forum of his home , and the tribunal of his vicinage . \"",

                    "text": "Weiquan movement = The Weiquan movement is a non-centralized group of lawyers , legal experts , and intellectuals in China who seek to protect and defend the civil rights of the citizenry through litigation and legal activism . The movement , which began in the early 2000s , has organized demonstrations , sought reform via the legal system and media , defended victims of human rights abuses , and written appeal letters , despite opposition from Communist Party authorities . Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights , protection for AIDS victims , environmental damage , religious freedom , freedom of speech and the press , and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment . Individuals involved in the Weiquan movement have met with occasionally harsh reprisals from Chinese officials , including disbarment , detention , harassment , and , in extreme instances , torture . Authorities have also responded to the movement with the launch of an education campaign on the \" socialist concept of rule of law , \" which reasserts the role of the Communist Party and the primacy of political considerations in the legal profession , and with the Three Supremes , which entrenches the supremacy of the Communist Party in the judicial process . = = Background = = Since the legal reforms of the late 1970s and 1980s , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) has moved to embrace the language of the rule of law and establish a modern court system . In the process , it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations , and begun training more legal professionals . The concept of \" rule of law \" was enshrined in the constitution , and the CCP embarked on campaigns to publicize the idea that citizens have protection under the law . At the same time , however , a fundamental contradiction exists in the implementation of rule of law wherein the CCP insists that its authority supersedes that of the law ; the constitution enshrines rule of law , but also emphasizes the principle of the \" leadership of the Communist Party . \" The judiciary is not independent , and is therefore subject to politicization and control by the Communist Party . This has produced a system that is often described as \" rule by law , \" rather than rule of law . Because judicial decisions are subject to the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP , citizens who attempt to make use of the legal system to pursue grievances find that , if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party , they may be suppressed . Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges , such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs , often have few means of pursuing an effective defense . The Weiquan movement coalesced in the early 2000s in response to these inherent contradictions and the arbitrary exercise of legal authority in China , though its roots could be traced to the consumer protection movement that began in the 1990s . The movement is informal , and can be understood as including lawyers and legal activists who advocate for civil rights and defend the interests of citizens against corporations , government or Communist Party organs . Fu Hualing and Richard Cullen note that Weiquan lawyers \" are generally always on the side of the weaker party : ( migrant ) workers v. employers in labor disputes ; peasants in cases involving taxation , persons contesting environmental pollution , land appropriation , and village committee elections ; journalists facing government censorship ; defendants subject to criminal prosecution ; and ordinary citizens who are discriminated against by government policies and actions . \" The emergence of the Weiquan movement was made possible by a confluence of factors , including a market for their services , and an emerging rights consciousness . It was also facilitated by the 1996 \" Lawyers Law , \" which changed the definition of lawyers from \" state legal workers \" to professionals holding a legal certificate who perform legal services . The law effectively delinked lawyers from the state , and gave lawyers greater ( though still limited ) autonomy within the profession . Weiquan lawyers tend to be especially critical of the lack of judicial independence in China . Rather than challenging particular laws , they frame their work as being in keeping with Chinese laws , and describe their activities as a means of defending and upholding the Constitution against abuses . As such , Weiquan lawyering has been described as a form of Rightful resistance . = = Weiquan lawyers = = Weiquan Lawyers ( Chinese : \u7ef4\u6743\u5f8b\u5e08 ) , or \" rights protection \" lawyers , refer to a small but influential movement of lawyers , legal practitioners , scholars and activists who help Chinese citizens to assert their constitutional , civil rights and / or public interest through litigation and legal activism . In the context of a rising number of lawyers in China , the proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small Weiquan Lawyers face considerable personal , financial and professional risks . Notable Weiquan Lawyers include He Weifang , Xu Zhiyong , Teng Biao , Guo Feixiong and Chen Guangcheng , Gao Zhisheng , Zheng Enchong , and Li Heping . Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints , engage in litigation , and educate fellow citizens about their rights . Some Weiquan lawyers are the pragmatists and some are more radical . = = Major fields = = = = = Freedom of expression = = = Although freedom of speech is enshrined in Article 35 of the Constitution of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese authorities enforce restrictions on political and religious expression . Such restrictions are sometimes in accordance with Article 105 of the criminal code , which contains vague and broadly defined provisions against \" inciting subversion of state power \" . Weiquan lawyers , along with international human rights organizations , have argued that the provisions against subversion are inconsistent both with China 's own constitution and with international human rights standards , particularly in light of the lack of transparency and clear guidelines used in applying the laws . Several Weiquan lawyers have been involved in litigation and other forms of advocacy to defend the rights to free expression for individuals charged with the crime of subversion . Notable cases include that of Liu Xiaobo , a prominent Beijing intellectual sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion in December 2009 . Chengdu activist Tan Zuoren was sentenced to five years for inciting subversion for publishing writings on the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre , advocating for the families of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake victims , and accepting interviews from the Falun Gong-affiliated Sound of Hope radio . His lawyers were reportedly barred from entering the courtroom . In October 2009 , intellectual Guo Quan was sentenced to 10 years in prison for publishing \" reactionary \" articles online . Weiquan lawyers have also challenged the application of state secret laws , which are sometimes used to prosecute individuals who disseminate information on politically sensitive issues . In November 2009 , for instance , lawyers were involved in arguing for Huang Qi , a Sichuan activist who had advocated online for the parents of Sichuan earthquake victims . Huang was sentenced to three years in prison for possession of state secrets . = = = Judicial independence = = = The Chinese Constitution enshrines rule of law , but simultaneously emphasizes the principle of the \" leadership of the Communist Party . \" The legal profession itself is subordinate to the authority of the Communist Party ; the Ministry of Justice , not the bar associations , is responsible for issuing and renewing lawyers ' licenses . Weiquan lawyers have argued that this structure precludes the emergence of genuine rule of law , and in some cases have advocated for reforms to advance judicial independence and the protection of legal professionals . In late August 2008 , a collection of several dozen Beijing lawyers signed a petition stating that the Beijing Bar Association leaders should be elected by the organization 's members , rather than being appointed . The petition letter stated that selection process in place for the Association 's directors is inconsistent with official guidelines and the Chinese constitution , and should be replaced with a democratic voting process . The Beijing Bar Association responded to the campaign by asserting that \" Any individual who uses text messages , the web or other media to privately promote and disseminate the concept of direct elections , express controversial opinions , thereby spreading rumors within the Beijing Bar Association , confuse and poison people 's minds , and convince people of circumstances that do not exist regarding the so-called ' Call For Direct Elections For the Beijing Bar Association ' is illegal . \" The following year , the Beijing Bureau of Justice refused to renew the licenses of 53 Beijing Weiquan lawyers , all of whom had signed the petition for elections to the Bar Association . = = = Land rights = = = Under Chinese property law , there is no privately held land ; \" urban land \" is owned by the state , which grants land rights for a set number of years . Rural , or \" collectively owned land , \" is leased by the state for periods of 30 years , and is theoretically reserved for agricultural purposes , housing and services for farmers . Forced evictions are forbidden under International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which China has ratified . Under China 's constitution and other property laws , expropriation of urban land is permitted only if it is for the purpose of supporting the \" public interest , \" and those being evicted are supposed to receive compensation , resettlement , and protection of one 's living conditions . The \" public interest \" is not defined , however , and abuses are common in the expropriation process , with many citizens complaining of receiving little or no compensation . Forced evictions with little or no compensation occur frequently in both urban and rural China , with even fewer legal protections for rural citizens . Collectively owned rural land may be \" reallocated \" at the discretion of authorities , and in many regions local governments collude with private developers to reclassify rural land as urban land , which can then be sold. from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s , an estimated 40 million Chinese peasants were affected by land requisitions . Citizens who resist or protest the evictions have reportedly been subjected to harassment , beatings , or detention , and land-related grievances occasionally escalate into large-scale protests or riots . Several Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of individual citizens whose land and homes were taken with inadequate compensation , including Shanghai lawyer Zheng Enchong . Ni Yulan , a Beijing lawyer , was herself left homeless by forced eviction , and became an outspoken advocate for victims before being sentenced to two years in prison . In 2007 , a 54-year-old farmer in Heilongjiang Yang Chunlin published numerous articles on human rights and land rights , and helped to organise a petition entitled : \" We want human rights , not the Olympics . \" The petition reportedly collected over ten thousand signatures . Yang was put to trial , and sentenced to five years in prison , where he has allegedly been tortured . Li Fangping was hired to defend him , but was denied access to his client . = = = Defense of ethnic minorities = = = Several Weiquan lawyers , including Teng Biao , Jiang Tianyong , and Li Fangping , offered legal aid to Tibetans in the wake of the March 2008 Tibetan protests . The protests resulted in the imprisonment of at least 670 Tibetans , and the execution of at least four individuals . Chinese government sources asserted that the unrest and violence in Tibet had been masterminded by the Dalai Lama and executed by his followers for the purpose of fomenting unrest and disrupting the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . The Open Constitution Initiative ( OCI ) , operated by several Weiquan lawyers and intellectuals , issued a paper in May 2009 challenging the official narrative , and suggesting that the protests were instead a response to economic inequities , Han Chinese migration , and religious sentiments . The OCI recommended that Chinese authorities better respect and protect the rights and interests of the Tibetan people , including religious freedom , and pursue the reduction of economic inequality and official corruption . Tibetan Filmmaker Dhondup Wangcheng was sentenced to six years in prison for making a documentary on human rights in Tibet in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics . Two lawyers who sought to represent him , Chang Boyang and Li Dunyong , faced threats and harassment for their advocacy . In July 2010 , a group of Chinese activists including Teng Biao co-signed a letter to the Chinese leadership to protest the 15-year prison sentence that had been meted out to Uighur journalist Halaite Niyaze . Niyaze was not permitted to have a lawyer at his trial , where he was charged with \" endangering state security . \" According to reports , Niyaze was being charged because he had criticized the Chinese government in an interview with a Hong Kong news agency for not doing enough to prevent the July 2009 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi riots . = = = Falun Gong = = = Falun Gong , a spiritual qigong discipline that once claimed tens of million adherents in China , was banned in July 1999 under the leadership of the Communist Party , and a campaign was launched to suppress the group . In an attempt to have Falun Gong adherents renounce their belief in the practice , they are subject to state-sanctioned , systematic violence in custody , sometimes resulting in death . Some sources indicate hundreds of thousands may have been detained in reeducation-through-labor camps for practicing Falun Gong and / or resisting persecution . In November 1999 , the Supreme People 's Court offered a judicial interpretation of article 300 of the criminal code , stating that Falun Gong should be regarded as a \" xie jiao , \" or cult . Large numbers were subsequently sentenced to long prison terms , often under article 300 , in what are typically very short trials without the presence of a lawyer . In 2009 alone , the Falun Dafa Information Center reported that several hundred Falun Gong adherents have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 18 years . Human rights groups , including Amnesty International , note that the application of the law to persecute Falun Gong adherents contravenes both China 's own constitution and international standards . Several Weiquan lawyers have argued similarly while defending Falun Gong adherents who face criminal or administrative sentencing for their beliefs . Lawyers who have defended Falun Gong include Guo Guoting , Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu , Wang Yonghang , Tang Jitian and Liu Wei , among others . In addition to litigation work , Weiquan lawyers like Gao Zhisheng have also advocated publicly and in the media for human rights for Falun Gong . In 2004 and 2005 , Gao wrote a series of letters to China 's top leadership detailing accounts of torture and sexual abuse against Falun Gong practitioners , and calling for an end to the persecution of the group . In response , Gao lost his legal license , was put under house arrest , detained , and was reportedly tortured . = = = HIV / AIDS = = = Some Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of HIV / AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives . In the 1990s , government officials in central China , and especially in Henan , encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes . Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV . According to activists , victims have not been compensated , and no government officials were held accountable . Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic , which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun , the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan . Hu Jia is arguably the most well known advocate for HIV / AIDS victims , having served as the executive director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute of Health Education and as one of the founders of the non-governmental organization Loving Source . = = = Women 's rights = = = Chen Guangcheng , a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer , rose to prominence for defending victims of China 's one-child policy . First implemented in 1979 , the one-child policy mandates that couples may only have one child , though there are exceptions for some rural citizens , ethnic minorities , and couples who were themselves only children . Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures , Chinese authorities and family planning staff have been accused of carrying out coercive , late-term forced abortions , sterilization , incarceration and torture to enforce the policy . In 2005 , Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi , Shandong , who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions . = = = Underground Christians = = = China 's constitution guarantees freedom of religion , yet also provides a caveat specifying that only \" normal \" religious activities are permitted . In practice , religious freedom is granted only within the strictly prescribed parameters of the five officially sanctioned \" patriotic \" religious associations of Buddhism , Taoism , Islam , Protestantism and Catholicism . Groups falling outside the state-administered religions , including \" underground \" or \" house church \" Christians , are subject to varying degrees of repression and persecution . Although there are no definitive figures on the number of underground Christians in China , some estimates have put their total number in excess of 70 million . At least 40 Catholic bishops operate independent of official sanction , and some are under surveillance , house arrest , detention , or have disappeared . Several leaders and members of underground Protestant churches have also been detained and sentenced to reeducation through labor or prison terms . Violent raids and demolitions have been carried out on underground churches , sometimes resulting in injury to congregants inside . Chinese officials have labelled several underground Protestant churches as a xie jiao ( translated literally as \" evil religion \" ) , or cult , thus providing a pretext for harsher punishment of members . Several prominent Weiquan lawyers themselves identify with the underground Protestant movement , and have sought to defend church members and leaders facing imprisonment . These include Zhang Kai , Li Heping , and Gao Zhisheng . Former house church leader Bob Fu 's US-based organization \" ChinaAid \" has sponsored legal cases , and provided \" rule-of-law training \" and legal help for distressed clients in China . = = = Other initiatives = = = A number of specific events have attracted the help and attention of Weiquan activists . In the March 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province , shoddy school construction resulted in the collapse of several schools full of students . A number of Weiquan lawyers , including Tan Zuoren , were involved in advocating for the rights of parents , and in investigating allegations that corrupt officials were responsible for the poor construction . Parents and lawyers met with reprisals from Chinese officials for their activism . Later the same year , it was revealed that large quantities of infant formula had been tainted with melamine , causing 300,000 infants to fall ill and resulting in several deaths . A group of parents of the victims were reportedly detained for attempting to draw media attention to their plight . Dozens of lawyers \u2014 particularly from the provinces of Hebei , Henan and Shandong \u2014 offered pro-bono legal services to victims , but their efforts were obstructed by authorities . Individual human rights cases , such as the Deng Yujiao incident and the death of Qian Yunhui , have also drawn help from rights defenders such as Wu Gan . In 2003 , a group of legal scholars , including Teng Biao and Xu Zhiyong , formed the Open Constitution Initiative ( Chinese : \u516c\u76df ) to advocate for greater rule of law . The organization was involved in the Sun Zhigang case , and has advocated for petitioners , labor rights , freedom of expression , HIV / AIDS victims , Tibetans , land rights , and protection of public health , among other issues . = = Government response = = = = = Retrenchment on rule of law = = = In response to the emergence of the Weiquan movement , which often makes use of the official language about \" rule of law \" to justify its work , in April 2006 a political campaign was launched to solidify the Communist Party 's leadership over judicial work , combat the idea of greater independence for judges and lawyers , and educate people and judicial authorities about the \" socialist concept of rule of law . \" The campaign was announced by Luo Gan , then the head of the Party Central Committee 's Political and Legislative Affairs Committee . Luo urged that in order to protect political stability , \" forceful measures \" be adopted \" against those who , under the pretext of rights-protection ( weiquan ) , carry out sabotage . \" The launch of the campaign coincided with a crackdown on Weiquan lawyers . Shortly after the campaign 's launch , Party Committees provided instruction to judges reminding them of the political goals that their work must uphold . According to one document issued to judges in Zhejiang and quoted by Human Rights Watch , \" Recently , some judges have started to believe that to be a judge you just have to strictly apply the law in a case . In fact , this kind of concept is erroneous [ ... ] all the legal formulations have a clear political background and direction [ ... ] We must stamp out the kind of narrow viewpoint that thinks that you can also do court work by having judicial independence . \" During a December 2007 conference on political-legal work , CCP general secretary Hu Jintao articulated the theory of the \" Three Supremes , \" which emphasized again that legal work should regard as supreme the concerns and interests of the Communist Party . In March 2008 , Wang Shengjun was confirmed as the new head of the Supreme People 's Court . Wang , who has no formal legal training himself , abandoned the efforts of his predecessors to improve judicial competence , training , and autonomy , and instead placed primary importance on the ideological implications of the \" Three Supremes \" theory and upholding the leadership of the Communist Party . In 2010 , China 's Ministry of Justice issued two new regulations intended to \" strengthen the supervision and management of lawyers and law firms \" . According to the Associated Press , the new regulations would serve to \" allow authorities to punish lawyers ... for actions such as talking to the media or even causing ' traffic troubles . ' \" In March 2012 , China 's Ministry of Justice issued a new directive requiring lawyers first obtaining their license or renewing an existing license to swear an oath of loyalty to the Communist Party . According to the Ministry 's website , a section of oath includes the following : \u201c I swear to faithfully fulfill the sacred mission of legal workers in socialism with Chinese characteristics . I swear my loyalty to the motherland , to the people , to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system , and to protect the dignity of the Constitution and laws . \" = = = Suppression of lawyers and coercive measures = = = Weiquan lawyers have faced various challenges to their work from the Chinese government , including disbarment or suspension , violence , threats , surveillance , arbitrary detention , and prosecution . This is particularly true for lawyers who take up politically sensitive cases . Reports of harassment , intimidation , and violence against Weiquan lawyers increased in 2006 following the launch of the campaign to promote the \" socialist concept of the rule of law . \" Authorities have refused to renew the licenses of several dozen Weiquan lawyers , and several have effectively been banned for life from the legal profession . In 2009 , for instance , at least 17 Weiquan lawyers were not permitted to renew their legal licenses after taking on politically sensitive cases . Several Weiquan lawyers have themselves been sentenced to prison in response to their activism . A selection of notable instances of suppression are listed here : Gao Zhisheng , once recognized as one of China 's ten most promising lawyers , was an advocate for a range of disenfranchised individuals and minorities . In 2006 , after he wrote a series of letters to the Chinese leadership concerning the torture of Falun Gong adherents , Gao had his legal license revoked and his law firm was shut down . His family was placed under house arrest , and he was detained for six months . Gao was sentenced , with a five-year reprieve , to four years in prison . He has been the subject of several prolonged disappearances into custody , during which he has reportedly been tortured . On 27 December 2007 , AIDS and pro-democracy activist Hu Jia was detained as part of a crackdown on dissents during the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics . A well known rights advocate who had advocated on behalf of AIDS victims , peasants , victims of land requisitions , Hu had also been critical of the lack of human rights progress that had been made ahead of the Olympic games . Hu pleaded not guilty at his trial in March 2008 . On 3 April 2008 , he was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for \" inciting subversion of state power . \" He had previously been under house arrest , and has reportedly been beaten by police . In response to his work to bring a class action lawsuit against family planning authorities in Linyi , Shandong Province in 2005 , Chen Guangcheng was put under house arrest , threatened , detained , and beaten . Three other Weiquan activists \u2013 Li Fangping , Li Subin , and Xu Zhiyong \u2014 visited him to offer support , but were themselves beaten and interrogated . On 24 August 2006 , he was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for \" damaging property and gathering crowds to disturb transport order . \" Following his release , he remains under house arrest . On 22 April 2010 , Beijing lawyers Liu Wei and Tang Jitian were permanently disbarred for defending Falun Gong practitioners . On 13 May 2009 , lawyers Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu are violently beaten and detained in Chongqing for investigating the death of Jiang Xiqing , a 66-year-old Falun Gong practitioner killed in a labor camp . One month earlier , Beijing lawyer Cheng Hai was similarly beaten by police in Sichuan province for seeking to defend a Falun Gong adherent . Yang Chunlin was arrested in July 2007 and charged with \" inciting subversion of state power \" . His trial began in February 2008 in the city of Jiamusi . Yang was sentenced to five years in prison on 24 March 2008 . He maintained his innocence throughout the trial . During and after the hearing at which he was sentenced , Yang was reportedly beaten with an electric rod on at least two occasions . On 4 July 2009 , around 20 security agents broke into the home of Wang Yonghang . Wang , a Weiquan lawyer from Dalian City , had defended Falun Gong adherents . He was taken into custody for interrogation and was reportedly beaten severely . Wang 's lawyers were not permitted to contact him . In November 2009 , Wang was sentenced in a closed court to seven years in prison for his advocacy on behalf of Falun Gong practitioners . When his lawyers were permitted to see him in January 2010 , they reported that he had been tortured . On 17 July 2009 , authorities in Beijing raided and shuttered the Open Constitution Initiative , an NGO established by legal scholars Teng Biao and Xu Zhiyong . On 20 February 2011 , several Weiquan activists were detained following online calls for pro-democracy protests in China , including Chen Wei , Jiang Tianyong , Tang Jitian , and Teng Biao . In May 2014 , as multiple Chinese activists began preparing for the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , a number of lawyers were arrested for planning or being suspected of planning demonstrations . Among those arrested was Pu Zhiqiang , a lawyer who was involved in organising the demonstrations in 1989 . = = International response = = Although there is relatively little awareness of the Weiquan phenomenon as a movement outside of China , Western governments and human rights organizations have consistently expressed concern over the treatment of individual Weiquan lawyers in China , some of whom have faced disbarment , imprisonment , prolonged disappearance , sentencing and alleged torture for their work in promoting civil rights and speaking out against one-party rule . In October 2010 , a bipartisan group of 29 members of the U.S. House of Representatives pressed President Obama to raise the cases of Liu Xiaobo and Gao Zhisheng with the Chinese leadership , writing of Gao Zhizheng 's prolonged detention : \" If lawyers are hauled away for the \" crime \" of defending their clients , then even the pretense of rule of law in China has failed . \" The U.S. State Department claims to have raised the cases of these two individuals with their Chinese counterparts . In 2008 , Hu Jia was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament recognizing his human rights advocacy . The same year , Hu and Gao Zhisheng received nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize , and were considered to be favorites for the award . Two years later , seven members of the U.S. House of Representatives nominated imprisoned lawyers Gao Zhisheng and Chen Guangcheng , along with fellow dissident Liu Xiaobo for the prize . The letter noted that these individuals have sought to \" raise the Chinese people 's awareness of their dignity and rights , and to call their government to govern within its constitution , its laws , and the international human rights agreements it has signed , \" and thereby made a significant contribution to peace . The Nobel Prize Committee awarded the honor to Liu in absentia in December 2010 .",

Croatia finished accession ( membership ) negotiations on 30 June 2011 and signed the Treaty of Accession on 9 December 2011 , setting it on course to become the bloc 's 28th member state . The Constitution of Croatia requires that a binding referendum be held on any political union reducing national sovereignty , such as via European Union membership . On 23 December 2011 the Croatian Parliament made a preliminary decision on EU accession and determined that the referendum would be held on 22 January 2012 . The 2012 Croatian EU accession referendum was the first referendum held in Croatia since the Croatian independence referendum held more than 20 years earlier , in 1991 . The Croatian EU accession referendum campaign officially began on 3 January 2012 ; a yes vote was supported by both the political parties in government and the larger opposition parties in Croatia . The largest parties ' joint support of EU membership existed since 2005 , when the Alliance for Europe ( Croatian : Savez za Europu ) was set up as an informal alliance aimed at achieving membership as a strategic goal of Croatian foreign policy . Opposition to Croatian EU accession was voiced by non-parliamentary parties only . The pro-membership and informational campaign \u2013 which included television promotional videos , addresses by leading government and opposition politicians , and information booklets mailed to every household in Croatia \u2013 was announced to have cost 4.8 million kuna ( c . \u20ac 640,000 ) . Opinion polling was regularly carried out by three different agencies ; since May 2011 , percentages supporting EU membership ranged between 55 % and 63 % . The Croatian State Election Committee was in charge of vote organization , ballot counting and result publication . The EU accession referendum passed with 66.27 % votes cast in support , 33.13 % against the proposed joining of the EU and 0.60 % invalid or blank votes ; it also passed in all Croatian counties . The greatest support for the referendum was recorded in Me\u0111imurje and Brod-Posavina counties , at 75.73 % and 72.61 % respectively . The lowest support for EU accession was recorded in Dubrovnik-Neretva County , where 42.22 % of votes were cast against the proposal . The average official turnout for the referendum was 43.51 % ; the highest official turnouts were recorded in the city of Zagreb and in Vara\u017edin County at 55.13 % and 53.66 % respectively . The result was binding on the Croatian Parliament ; as a consequence , it ratified the accession treaty on 9 March 2012 . The outcome was welcomed by all political parties represented in Croatia 's parliament ; some right-wing politicians objected to the low turnout and what they consider a loss of independence . = = Background = = Croatia applied for European Union ( EU ) membership in 2003 , the European Commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 , and the European Council granted candidate country status to Croatia in mid-2004 . Accession negotiations , while originally set for March 2005 , began in October of that year . Croatia completed the accession negotiations on 30 June 2011 ; on 9 December 2011 it signed the Treaty of Accession , changing its status from a candidate to an acceding country as it prepared to become the 28th EU member state . The ratification process by the Parliaments of all 27 current EU member states was expected to be concluded by the end of June 2013 , and Croatia 's accession to the EU was expected to take place on 1 July 2013 . In addition to ratification by the current EU member states , Article 142 of the Constitution of Croatia requires that a binding referendum be held on sovereignty issues such as Croatian EU membership . = = = Voting issues = = = The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with referendum voting organization , ballot counting , and result publication . The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07 : 00 and lasting until 19 : 00 , at regular polling stations in Croatia , in Croatian military units , in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad , on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons : 6,750 polling stations in all . For the referendum , all polling stations were grouped in a single district . Voters traveling abroad were permitted to vote in the Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections ; however , the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from their place of residence to vote in the referendum , nor did it allow absentee ballots . GONG , the Croatian election supervision NGO , requested that the authorities correct this . One restriction was removed by 3 January , when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence . Registration was possible until 7 January , in person , by fax , or by e-mail . When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum , there were 4,504,686 voters in the voter registry ( the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections ) . The State Election Committee defined the polling stations 's appearance and their immediate surroundings up to 50 metres ( 160 feet ) away , prohibiting campaigning and displaying of promotional materials there as with elections in Croatia . Unlike Croatian elections , there is no mandatory halt to campaigning before a referendum . GONG appointed approximately 300 observers to monitor the referendum voting . The Election Committee announced that it would start publishing voting results on its web site two hours after the polling stations in Croatia closed , and it would expect to determine the referendum 's outcome by midnight . If a proposed question was supported by a simple majority of those voting , the proposal would be considered passed and the result binding on the Croatian Parliament pursuant to \u00a7 87 , paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Croatian Constitution . Since the referendum passed , the Croatian Parliament was required to ratify the Croatian EU accession treaty . Amendments ( from 2010 ) to the constitution provide that referendums are valid regardless of actual turnout . If the referendum proposal were to have failed , it could have been repeated in six months or a year . It is estimated that a referendum rejection would have cost Croatia approximately \u20ac 1.6 billion in lost EU funding until 2014 . = = Date = = In November 2010 , the Croatian Parliament decided to hold the EU accession referendum 30 days after the treaty was signed ; since the treaty was signed on 9 December 2011 , the referendum was consequently ( originally ) scheduled for 9 January 2012 . In November 2010 , the Croatian Government proposed to hold the EU accession referendum simultaneously with another referendum aimed at altering general referendum rules . Days after the 2011 parliamentary elections in early December 2011 , it was suggested by Vesna Pusi\u0107 \u2013 already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs \u2013 that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll . The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later ; its request was also supported by five major trade unions . GONG 's request was made because of what they stated to be : poor information provided to citizens ; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter 's permanent residence ; unclear directions for voting abroad ; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions ; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan , non-partisan and foreign monitors ; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding ( since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses ) ; no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself ; and the lack of restrictions against campaigning on the day of the referendum . The union support for this request was due to the government 's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum ( altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures ) , which they had earlier agreed to do . Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government , demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) returned the final verdict in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Marka\u010d . They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY , which they describe as biased ; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others . On 23 December 2011 , the Croatian Parliament made a preliminary decision on EU membership and determined that the EU accession referendum would be held on 22 January 2012 . Furthermore , no other referendum question would be presented at that time . The preliminary accession decision was supported by 129 MPs , with the 6 Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja ( HDSSB ) MPs abstaining . During the debate that preceded the vote , the HDSSB MPs requested that the EU accession referendum be postponed for three to six months in order to allow a broader discussion on EU accession . Their specific concern was that Croatia might lose elements of its statehood and sovereignty , and the postponement was requested to present to the voters the effects of the Treaty of Lisbon on Croatia before the referendum was held . The parliamentary decision to hold the referendum on 22 January 2012 was supported by 124 MPs , with 6 HDSSB MPs and 6 Croatian Labourists \u2013 Labour Party MPs voting against the decision . The Labour party advocated postponing the referendum until 12 February in order to give more time to provide information on the consequences of EU membership . The referendum question was announced by the newly elected Prime Minister designate Zoran Milanovi\u0107 as \" simple and bare \" : \" Are you for the membership of the Republic of Croatia in the European Union ? \" The 2012 Croatian EU accession referendum was the first referendum held in Croatia since the Croatian independence referendum in 1991 . = = Campaign = = The Croatian EU accession referendum campaign officially started on 3 January 2012 , with a declaration that it was aimed at providing to Croatian citizens clear , concise and transparent information on the EU accession negotiations and EU membership . The campaign included television promotions and addresses by leading politicians such as : the President of Croatia , Ivo Josipovi\u0107 ; the prime minister , Zoran Milanovi\u0107 ; the foreign minister , Vesna Pusi\u0107 ; other government members , such as Milanka Opa\u010di\u0107 , Radimir \u010ca\u010di\u0107 , Neven Mimica and \u017deljko Jovanovi\u0107 ; and former prime minister and opposition leader Jadranka Kosor . ( All of these supported the referendum in their addresses . ) A telephone information hotline was also set up , and 2.15 million EU information booklets were prepared for mailing to every household in the country . Finally , summaries of the accession treaty , negotiation documents and governmental report on the EU accession negotiations were published online , as were the original documents . It was announced that the campaign cost 4.8 million kuna ( c . \u20ac 640,000 ) . The leading parliamentary political parties in Croatia have jointly supported EU accession since 2005 , when a group called the Alliance for Europe ( Croatian : Savez za Europu ) was set up as an informal alliance aimed at achieving EU membership as a strategic goal of Croatian foreign policy . Opposition to the referendum was voiced by the Croatian Party of Rights dr . Ante Star\u010devi\u0107 , a political party holding a single seat in the Croatian Parliament , claiming too little information provided to the voters , rather than the party being eurosceptic . Further opposition was voiced by several non-parliamentary parties . The most substantial opposition to the accession came from the Croatian Party of Rights ( HSP ) , which demanded that the government fund its television campaign against EU membership . HSP also printed leaflets advocating rejecting EU accession . The party also organized other activities at 150 locations in the country aimed at the referendum proposal 's rejection . During the 2011 parliamentary election campaign , HSP declared itself as the only party advocating rejection of Croatian EU accession ; it failed to win a single seat , receiving 3 % of the votes . Further opposition to the Croatian EU membership came from a group of non-parliamentary political parties organized as the Alliance for Croatia ( Croatian : Savez za Hrvatsku ) claiming that the move jeopardizes Croatian independence , but the alliance 's December 2011 protest in Zagreb drew only 150 people . The government 's campaign was criticized as having poor promotional videos , especially lacking in informational value . The final days of the campaign were marked by events in support of and opposition to joining the EU , as the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs set up an EU information event in Zagreb , while a protest against EU accession at the main city square drew 200 ( some arrests occurred ) . The Croatian Bishops ' Conference called on citizens to vote in the referendum , reminding Croatians that Croatia is a part of European culture while refraining from directly advocating either position . The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts also supported joining the EU with 93 academicians in favour , 2 against and 1 abstention ; they said that the event represents a great opportunity for Croatia . In contrast to EU accession opponents ' request to postpone the referendum until Generals Gotovina and Marka\u010d were released by the ICTY , Gotovina himself urged citizens of Croatia to vote in the referendum and said that he would vote in favour of joining the EU . = = Opinion polls = = Opinion polling regarding Croatian EU membership was regularly carried out by the CRO Demoskop , Ipsos Puls and Mediana Fides agencies . Since 2008 , these polls overall indicated support for Croatian EU membership ; in May 2011 and after , support ranged between 55 % and 63 % . The highest support since 2008 was 64 % in the first half of November 2010 . The lowest level of EU membership support ( between 23 % and 38 % ) was reported on 15 \u2013 16 April 2011 in the wake of the ICTY 's guilty verdict for Generals Gotovina and Marka\u010d . In early January 2012 , an NGO advocating voting against the referendum called the \" Council for Croatia \u2013 NO TO EU \" ( Croatian : Vije\u0107e za Hrvatsku \u2013 NE U EU ) reported that they had contracted a Canadian company ( one unknown to the Croatian public ) called the \" Business Knowledge Corporation \" to conduct their own poll on the issue ; they stated that with 1,942 polled , 57.2 % were against the referendum while 41 % declined to answer the poll question . The NGO said that the apparent gross disparity between these results and the results of all other recent polls was due to government manipulation . = = Results = = The EU accession referendum passed with 66.27 % of votes cast in support and 33.13 % against EU membership for Croatia . There were 0.6 % blank or invalid votes . Even though all Croatian citizens were voting in a single constituency for the referendum 's purposes , the State Election Committee published the results by individual counties , cities , and municipalities . The referendum passed in all Croatian counties . The greatest support for the referendum was recorded in Me\u0111imurje and Brod-Posavina counties at 75.73 % and 72.61 % respectively . The lowest support for the EU accession was recorded in Dubrovnik-Neretva County , where 42.22 % votes were cast against the proposal . The Croatian diaspora voted 83.13 % in support . Only 18 out of 556 cities or municipalities in Croatia voted against the referendum proposal . Of those , six are in Split-Dalmatia County , four in Koprivnica-Kri\u017eevci County , two in Zagreb and Dubrovnik-Neretva counties each , and a single municipality in Istria , Primorje-Gorski Kotar , \u0160ibenik-Knin and Zadar counties each . The average turnout at the referendum was 43.51 % . The figure includes the voters living abroad , whose turnout was only 3.51 % ; they comprise more than 9 % of the total Croatian electorate . The highest turnouts were recorded in the city of Zagreb and in Vara\u017edin County , at 55.13 % and 53.66 % respectively , while the lowest turnout in Croatia was recorded in Lika-Senj County at just 34.52 % . There is no turnout threshold for a referendum to be legally valid . The low turnout was attributed in part to poor voter registry maintenance . The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance , especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records . This allegation was supported by the 2011 census . The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout , which would otherwise have exceeded 50 % . It was later estimated that the actual turnout in Croatia itself , without the diaspora , was 61 % . = = = Reactions = = = = = = = Domestic = = = = After the result 's announcement , President Josipovi\u0107 commented that the day was of great significance to Croatia , defining the nation as one with a European future . Prime Minister Milanovi\u0107 welcomed the decision as historic and as the first such decision made by Croatians alone ; he also said that the referendum represented a turning point for Croatia . Croatian Parliament Speaker Boris \u0160prem said that a new chapter of Croatian history and better fortune for the nation was dawning . The Croatian Minister of the Economy , Radimir \u010ca\u010di\u0107 , concluded that Croatia 's credit rating would have been downgraded if the referendum had not passed . He also stated that , since the referendum passed , it was a good opportunity to upgrade the rating . Minister of Finance Slavko Lini\u0107 stated that he was pleased with the result , but not with the voter turnout . He disagreed with \u010ca\u010di\u0107 that the credit rating could be saved by this result , since everybody had already counted on Croatian entry to the EU . Foreign and European Affairs Minister Vesna Pusi\u0107 commented that the result was good news for Europe , which faced internal problems . Former Speaker Vladimir \u0160eks said that the low turnout was caused by external factors \u2013 the debt crisis in Europe and a loss of confidence in Croatian political parties and institutions . Luka Bebi\u0107 , also a former speaker of the Parliament , added that it was good that Croats had voted to join the EU . Former Croatian foreign minister Gordan Jandrokovi\u0107 commented that the result is especially important for the nation 's youth , and former Croatian President Stjepan Mesi\u0107 stated that Croatia should be competitive and use EU funds , adding that it is not enough to be happy with entering the EU . He also commented on claims that joining the EU was tantamount to entering a new Yugoslavia , saying that \" only idiots think that Yugoslavia should be renewed \" . On the other side , the HSP president Daniel Srb argued that the referendum was illegitimate since 71 % of Croatian voters had not taken part in the referendum or had voted against the entry of Croatia into the EU , and warned that only 28 % of Croatian voters had supported joining the EU . Srb also added that Croatian citizens had shown distrust of the Croatian Government . \u017deljko Sa\u010di\u0107 , a right-wing politician , stated that the government destroyed the concept of Croatian citizens and created an impression that Croatia was unable to govern itself . Sa\u010di\u0107 stated that the government had brought Croatia into a decaying organization in an illegitimate way , adding that the referendum result was a defeat of Croatian independence and they would challenge its validity in court . By the 3 March 2012 deadline , the Constitutional Court of Croatia received 22 appeals challenging the referendum 's legality ; it ruled against them all . = = = = International = = = = Supranational bodies European Union : Herman Van Rompuy , President of the European Council , and Jose Manuel Barroso stated that they salute the decision of Croatian voters . They stated that EU membership will bring Croatia new opportunities and contribute to its stability and prosperity . States Bosnia and Herzegovina : Members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the results of the referendum , expressing an expectation that Croatia would be a representative of former Yugoslavia once it became a member of the EU . Germany : German Chancellor Angela Merkel saluted the referendum 's outcome and stated that Germany anticipated the Croatian EU entry with joy . Ireland : T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Eamon Gilmore congratulated the Croatian people on their passing of the referendum on EU accession . Montenegro : Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovi\u0107 congratulated the Croatian president Ivo Josipovi\u0107 and the Croatian Government on the , as he called it , historic decision to enter the EU . Serbia : Serbian President Boris Tadi\u0107 congratulated the Croatian people for their decision to enter the EU . He concluded that this act was significant for Croatia 's future and was moreover a positive signal for the whole region . He stated that the Croatian EU entry would make it easier for Serbia and other countries of the region to enter the EU . Kosovo : Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj congratulated the Croatian people for a successful referendum through a note sent to the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Croatia , Vesna Pusi\u0107 . Minister Hoxhaj said in the note that Croatia remains a model to the other Balkan states aspiring to EU membership . \" The referendum of Croatia 's people which represents their aspiration to become member of the European Union is a momentum and an important drive for the other Balkan countries , aiming towards the great European family \" . Slovenia : Slovene Prime Minister Borut Pahor congratulated Croatia on a strategic decision of importance to Europe and the whole region . He added that EU entry is not a solution to all problems , but it makes it easier to solve them . United Kingdom : David Lidington of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated that he saluted the decision of Croatian citizens to join the EU . He also added that he hoped he would see Croatia as an EU member in July 2013 . = = Aftermath = = Pursuant to the referendum 's outcome , the Croatian parliament ratified the accession treaty unanimously ( with 136 votes in favour ) on 9 March 2012 .",

A successful merchant and politician , Hutchinson was active at high levels of the Massachusetts government for many years , serving as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1758 to 1774 . He was a politically polarising figure who , despite initial opposition to Parliamentary tax laws directed at the colonies , came to be identified by John Adams and Samuel Adams as a proponent of hated British taxes . He was blamed by Lord North ( the British Prime Minister at the time ) for being a significant contributor to the tensions that led the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . Hutchinson 's Boston mansion was ransacked in 1765 during protests against the Stamp Act , damaging his collection of materials on early Massachusetts history . As acting governor in 1770 he exposed himself to mob attack in the aftermath of the Boston massacre , after which he ordered the removal of troops from Boston to Castle William . Letters of his calling for abridgement of colonial rights were published in 1773 , further intensifying dislike of him in the colony . He was replaced as governor in May 1774 by General Thomas Gage , and went into exile in England , where he advised the government on how to deal with the Americans . Hutchinson had a deep interest in colonial history , collecting a large number of historical documents . He wrote a three volume History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , whose last volume , published posthumously , covered his own period in office . Historian Bernard Bailyn wrote of Hutchinson , \" If there was one person in America whose actions might have altered the outcome [ of the protests and disputes preceding the American Revolutionary War ] , it was he . \" Scholars use Hutchinson 's career to represent the tragic fate of the many Loyalists marginalized by their attachment to an outmoded imperial structure at a time when the modern nation-state was emerging . Paralysed by his ideology and his dual loyalties to America and Britain , Hutchinson exemplifies the Loyalist-as-loser . He sacrificed his love for Massachusetts to his uncritical loyalty to Great Britain , where he spent his last years in unhappy exile . = = Early life = = Thomas Hutchinson was born on 9 September 1711 in the North End of Boston , the fourth of twelve children of Thomas and Sarah Foster Hutchinson . Descended from early New England settlers ( including Anne Hutchinson by her son , Edward Hutchinson ) , his parents were both from well-to-do merchant families . His father was involved in the family mercantile trade , but was also active in political , military , and charitable circles and served on the provincial council . Young Thomas entered Harvard College at twelve , graduating in 1727 . His father introduced him to the business world early , and he displayed remarkable business acumen . According to his autobiographical sketch of his childhood , Hutchinson turned a modest gift of \" five quintals of fish \" from his father into between \u00a3 400 and \u00a3 500 by the time he was 21 . In 1732 he received some exposure to politics when he accompanied Governor Jonathan Belcher on a voyage to Casco Bay for negotiations with the Abenaki of Maine , then part of Massachusetts . The voyage was made in a vessel of which Hutchinson was part owner . In 1734 he married Margaret Sanford , a granddaughter of Rhode Island Governor Peleg Sanford . The Sanford and Hutchinson families had a long history of business and personal connections ; Margaret was in fact a distant relative . { Mrs. Hutchinson was also descended from Rhode Island governor William Coddington } The Marriage secured a political alliance between Hutchinson and Andrew and Peter Oliver which lasted long after Margaret 's death . Mary Sanford 's sister Mary { 1713-1773 } was the second wife of Andrew Oliver . Likewise a daughter of Thomas Hutchinson married a son of Peter Oliver . The Oliver brothers were also related to Massachusetts governor Jonathan Belcher and to New Hampshire Lt govs . William Partridge and George Vaughan ( Harvard Class of 1696 ) . The couple had twelve children , only five of whom survived to adulthood , before Margaret died in 1754 from complications of childbirth . = = Legislator and councillor = = In 1737 Hutchinson entered politics , being elected as a Boston selectman , and later in the year , to a seat in the General Court ( the provincial assembly ) . He spoke out against the province 's practice of issuing bills of credit ( as a form of paper currency ) , whose inflationary drop in value wrought havoc in the economy . This position was unpopular with the populist party in the province , and Hutchinson was voted out in the 1739 election . He was sent to England as an agent to plead on behalf of property owners affected by King George II 's decision concerning the boundary line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire which significantly favored New Hampshire . Hutchinson 's embassy was unsuccessful , although he returned with a bequest to Harvard for the construction of a new chapel ; Holden Chapel , built with these funds , still stands today . In 1742 Hutchinson was again elected to the General Court , where he served until 1749 , being the body 's speaker from 1746 to 1749 . His continued advocacy of currency reforms so annoyed the populist faction that the need to guard his properties in Boston and Milton from possible mob action was discussed . When the British government was convinced to refund the province 's expense for mounting the 1745 Louisbourg expedition , Hutchinson seized upon the idea of using the massive payment ( about \u00a3 180,000 in gold and silver ) to retire the province 's paper currency . Despite significant opposition , Hutchinson successfully navigated a bill implementing the idea through the assembly 's general court in 1749 ; it received the agreement of the Governor 's Council , and also the signature of Governor William Shirley . Many of the bill 's opponents were pleasantly surprised when the exchange of paper for specie did not cause any financial shocks , and Hutchinson 's popularity soared . Despite the success , Hutchinson was voted out of the assembly in 1749 . He was , however , immediately appointed to the Governor 's Council . In 1749 he headed a commission to arrange a treaty with the Indians in the District of Maine , which was then part of Massachusetts , and he served on boundary commissions to settle disputes with Connecticut and Rhode Island . In 1752 he was appointed judge of probate and a justice of the Common Pleas . Following the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754 , he was a delegate to the Albany Convention . In that meeting he took a leading part in the discussions , working with Benjamin Franklin to draft a plan for colonial union . Hutchinson agreed with Franklin that the present disunity endangered the British colonies , and that decisive action must be taken to knit the too-often-competing colonies into a coherent whole . Most important , the report drafted by Hutchinson concluded that the colonies must be encouraged to establish \" a Union of His Majesty 's several governments on the continent , that so their councils , treasure , and strength may be employed in due proportion against their common enemy \" . Hutchinson 's wife died quite suddenly in 1754 ; Hutchinson thereafter threw himself into his work . His work was not entirely of a political nature : in a humanitarian streak he supported Acadian refugees who had been expelled from their Nova Scotia homelands , even though this support of Roman Catholics did not gain him friends in Protestant Massachusetts . He was also sensitive to the needs of the military men involved in the war , often giving aid to needy families of veterans . = = Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts = = When Governor Shirley 's political opponents engineered his recall in 1757 , Hutchinson sought and received the endorsement of the British military leader Lord Loudoun in an effort to succeed Shirley as governor . During this time Hutchinson was the leading politician in the province due to the age and infirmity of Lieutenant Governor Spencer Phips . Hutchinson 's application was unsuccessful , but he did receive an appointment as lieutenant governor in 1758 , serving under Thomas Pownall . Hutchinson 's relationship with Pownall was awkward , for Pownall was at the center of political activities that dislodged Governor Shirley , under whose patronage Hutchinson had risen in power and influence . Pownall cultivated relations with the populist factions in the state , and sought to remove the influence of Shirley supporters , sometimes asking Hutchinson to turn against people he ( Hutchinson ) had earlier supported . This Hutchinson refused to do , since he saw these actions as harming the province 's stability and taking place at \" the caprice of the governor \" . Pownall , whose mistrust of Hutchinson was reciprocated , requested to leave to return to England in late 1759 . The political opposition of Shirley supporters and the death of some of his leading populist supporters may have contributed to this decision . He departed the province on 3 June 1760 , leaving Hutchinson as acting governor . Several months later Pownall 's replacement , Francis Bernard , arrived to take the reins of power . = = = Writs of assistance = = = One of Bernard 's early acts was the appointment of Hutchinson instead of James Otis , Sr. , as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature . This action by itself turned the province 's populists , whose vocal leaders included Otis and his son James Jr . , against both Hutchinson and Bernard , with long term consequences to Hutchinson 's reputation . Hutchinson , with no legal training , had not sought the post , and some emerging legal thinkers , notably a rising young lawyer named John Adams , were also outraged . In 1761 Hutchinson brought upon himself a storm of protest and criticism by issuing writs of assistance , documents that authorised essentially arbitrary searches by customs officials . Although some had been issued ( ironically over Hutchinson 's objections ) in earlier years , the writs he authorised were in some cases renewals of existing writs necessitated by the accession of King George III to the throne . Adams and the Otises seized on the issue to rail against his monopolisation of power ( since he was also a lieutenant governor and sat on the council ) and lack of legal qualifications for the post of chief justice . = = = Taxes and the Stamp Act = = = When the Sugar Act was being discussed in Parliament in 1763 , proposals were put forward to send Hutchinson to England to represent the colony 's opposition to the proposal . Governor Bernard , however , objected to sending the sitting lieutenant governor , and the bill was enacted . Much colonial protest followed , and Hutchinson was in agreement with vocal opponents like the Otises ( who around this time began using the phrase \" no taxation without representation \" ) that the law harmed the Massachusetts economy . In the ensuing debates , however , differences emerged between Hutchinson and others over Parliament 's supremacy and the feasibility of having formal colonial representation there , which were exacerbated by the personal animosity that had developed between Hutchinson and the Otises . Led by James Otis , Jr. and Oxenbridge Thacher , the anti-Parliament faction seized on every minor dispute to rail against Hutchinson and his faction 's monopolisation of power . Hutchinson was at first dismissive of these ongoing political attacks , believing that his opponents were either misguided or misled . Biographer Andrew Walmsley observes that Hutchinson at this stage seriously underestimated the impact of these attacks in building a coherent opposition to crown control , and in the damage it was doing to his own reputation . In debates leading up to the passage of the 1765 Stamp Act , both Hutchinson and Bernard quietly warned London not to proceed . Hutchinson in particular wrote that \" It cannot be good to tax the Americans ... You will lose more than you gain . \" When the assembly met to draft a petition to London on the matter in October 1764 , Hutchinson opposed the inclusion of the radicals ' language , and eventually pushed through a more moderate statement of opposition . However , the Massachusetts petition was seen as weak in comparison to those prepared by other colonies , and Hutchinson was claimed to be secretly seeking to promote the Stamp Act . He was also accused of \" treachery \" and \" betraying his country \" . News of the act 's passage propelled one of the most vocal opponents of Parliamentary supremacy , Samuel Adams , into a larger role in provincial politics . Hutchinson privately supported calls for its repeal , but his unwillingness to publicly oppose the act merely provided additional fuel for his opponents . = = = Mob violence = = = Hutchinson 's brother-in-law , colonial secretary Andrew Oliver , was given the job of \" stamp master \" , with responsibility for implementing the act in the province . Although Hutchinson apparently had no hand in this assignment , his opponents were quick to accuse him of further duplicity . His attempts to explain his position only fuelled the opposition , who recounted his early unpopular acts and questioned his motives in those deeds . On 13 August 1765 , mobs descended on Oliver 's home and office , ransacking both . The next night Hutchinson 's Boston mansion was surrounded , and the crowd demanded that he formally deny arguing in favour of the Stamp Act in his correspondence with London . He refused , and only the intervention of a moderate leader prevented any action that night . Twelve days later , on the evening of 26 August , a mob again formed outside of his mansion , and this time they would not be denied . Described by one architectural historian as \" the first developed example of provincial Palladianism in New England , \" the house was broken into ( Hutchinson and his family narrowly escaping ) , and systematically ransacked . The house finishings ( wainscoting and other decorative woodwork ) were effectively destroyed , and even the building 's cupola was taken down in violence that lasted the entire night . The family silver , furniture , and other items were stolen or destroyed ( although some items were eventually returned ) , and Hutchinson 's collection of historically important manuscripts was scattered . Hutchinson was then working on the final volume of his three volume history of the Massachusetts Bay colony . Many pages of the work were lost that night and had to be recreated . Hutchinson 's detailed inventory ( reprinted by biographer James Kendall Hosmer ) valued the damage done at more than \u00a3 2,200 , and he eventually received over \u00a3 3,100 from the province for his troubles . Hutchinson and his family temporarily took refuge at Castle William , and thereafter took up primary residence at Hutchinson 's estate in Milton . = = Governor of Massachusetts = = Because of the controversy over the Stamp Act , the radical faction came to control both the assembly and the governor 's council in 1766 , and Hutchinson was denied a seat on the governor 's council . Amid increased furor after the passage of the 1767 Townshend Acts , Governor Bernard requested and received British Army troops to protect crown officials . Letters written by Bernard describing conditions in the province were acquired by the radical opposition and published , leading to his recall . Bernard left for England on 1 August 1769 , leaving Hutchinson as acting governor . Hutchinson was unsuccessful in his attempts to distance himself from the unpopular Bernard administration , and he continued to be attacked in the assembly and the local press . Despite this , he continued to lobby for a formal appointment as governor . He categorically refused to again serve as lieutenant governor under another governor , preferring instead a posting elsewhere , or to resign the lieutenant governorship . Hutchinson was still acting governor when protests over the Townshend taxes erupted into the Boston Massacre on 5 March 1770 , when British soldiers fired into a crowd , killing five people . Hutchinson went to the scene in the aftermath of the shooting , and promised that justice would be applied fairly . He had all of the British soldiers involved in the incident arrested the next day , but ongoing unrest in the city compelled him to request the withdrawal of British troops from the city to Castle William . Hutchinson was able to postpone the trial for almost 6 months to allow anger to settle and for Adams to prepare a solid case . The soldiers were eventually tried , and two were convicted of manslaughter , although their sentences were reduced . The episode shook Hutchinson 's confidence in his ability to manage affairs in the province , and he penned a resignation letter . Governor Bernard had , in the mean time , taken up Hutchinson 's cause in London . In March 1771 Hutchinson 's commission as governor arrived in Boston , having been approved by the king while his resignation letter was going the other way . ( Colonial secretary Lord Hillsborough rejected his resignation . ) The instructions sent with the commission were fairly strict , and left Hutchinson relatively little room to manoeuvre politically . Instructions that particularly galled Samuel Adams included one restricting the meetings of the governor 's council , and another limiting the appointment of colonial agents to individuals having the governor 's approval . One of Hutchinson 's instructions was to relocate the provincial assembly from Boston to Cambridge , where it would be less under the influence of radical Boston politics . This modest demand , accomplished by executive order , resulted in howls of complaint of gubernatorial arbitrariness in the assembly , and an exchange of arguments , rebuttals , and counterarguments between Hutchinson and the assembly that ran for thousands of pages and lasted until 1772 . The nature of the affair furthered the radical cause , whose proponents painted Hutchinson 's action as a bold and devious attempt to further the executive prerogative . The radicals were further outraged when Hutchinson announced in 1772 that his salary , which had previously been subject to appropriation by the assembly , would be paid by the crown instead . This was seen by the radicals as a further usurpation of power that rightfully belonged in the province . Written debates with the assembly extended to the role of Parliament in governing the policies , and further deepened the divide between it and Hutchinson . They also raised flags elsewhere in the colonies and in England , where observers noted that Hutchinson 's arguments had effectively driven moderates in the province to join with the political hardliners . = = = Letters affair and Tea Party = = = The Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in 1772 when Hutchinson , in a speech to the assembly , argued that either the colony was wholly subject to Parliament , or that it was effectively independent . The assembly 's response , authored by John Adams , Samuel Adams , and Joseph Hawley , countered that the colonial charter granted autonomy . In England the colonial secretary , Lord Dartmouth , insisted to colonial agent Benjamin Franklin that the Massachusetts assembly retract its response . Franklin had acquired a packet of letters , written in the late 1760s by Hutchinson and other colonial officials , from which he concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies , and thus misled Parliament . Believing that wider knowledge of these letters would focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters , Franklin sent the letters to Thomas Cushing , the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly , in December 1772 . He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated , because he was not \" at liberty to make the letters public . \" The letters came into the hands of Samuel Adams , then serving as the clerk of the assembly , who engineered their publication in June 1773 . Franklin 's belief was only partially vindicated : the publication of the letters unleashed a torrent of vitriol against Hutchinson , but did nothing to lessen opposition to Parliamentary policy : instead the opposition saw the letters as confirmation of a conspiracy against their rights . The letters were reprinted throughout the colonies , and Hutchinson was burned in effigy in places as far away as Philadelphia during the uproar . Hutchinson 's letters , written between 1767 and 1769 to Thomas Whately , a retired former leading member of the British government , included the observation that it was impossible for colonists to have the full rights they would have in the home country , essentially requiring an \" abridgement of what are called English liberties \" . He made no specific proposals on how the colonial government should be reformed , writing in a letter that was not among those published , \" I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event . \" Letters by Andrew Oliver , in contrast , specifically proposed that the governor 's council , whose members where then elected by the assembly with the governor 's consent , be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown . Although much of what Hutchinson wrote in the letters was not particularly new , Samuel Adams masterfully manipulated the contents and implications of some of the statements by Hutchinson and Oliver to suggest they were conspiring with officials in London to deprive the colonists of their rights . Hutchinson was defended in print by provincial attorney general Jonathan Sewall , who claimed that Hutchinson was not actually expressing desired changes in the state of affairs , but ruminating instead on possible consequences of present conditions . The Massachusetts assembly drafted a petition to the Board of Trade demanding Hutchinson 's removal from office , and Hutchinson , concerned with the effect the letter publication and the assembly petition would have in London , requested permission to come to England to defend himself . The letter authorizing his return did not reach Boston until November 1773 , too late for him to depart that year ; his request and the assembly 's petition would not be heard until early 1774 . In the meantime , Parliament had repealed most of the Townshend taxes ( keeping only the one on tea ) , and passed the Tea Act , which authorised the British East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies , eliminating colonial merchants from its supply chain and undercutting the price of smuggled Dutch tea . This caused colonial merchants all over the North American colonies to organise opposition to the deliveries of the company 's tea . In Massachusetts the arrival of ships carrying tea in November 1773 brought about a crisis , since duties were to be paid on dutiable cargo within twenty days of a ship 's arrival . Hutchinson and his sons were among the businessmen to whom the company had consigned its tea , although Hutchinson disclaimed any official role in the choice of consignee . Other cargo was unloaded from the ships , but armed protestors patrolled the docks to ensure the tea was not landed . Hutchinson took a hard line , refusing to allow the tea ships to leave the harbour despite city-wide protests that the tea be sent back to England , and insisting that the duty be paid and the tea landed . When the twenty-day deadline arrived on 16 December , protestors ( some in Indian disguise ) boarded the ships that night and dumped the tea into the harbour . Hutchinson justified the hardline stance that contributed to the crisis by claiming it was his duty as governor to uphold the revenue laws , while American opponents such as James Bowdoin observed that he could have just as easily refused to accept the tea when it was clear that popular sentiment would make it impossible to land the tea . British critics complained that he should have asked the British troops in Boston to intervene . After it became known that other tea ships sent to North America had turned back , Hutchinson continued to justify his actions in letters to England , anticipating hearings on the matter once he arrived there . When the Board of Trade met to consider the assembly 's petition to recall Hutchinson , it also discussed the tea party . Franklin , as colonial agent , was forced to listen to a barrage of criticism , and was dismissed as colonial postmaster general . The assembly 's petition was dismissed as \" groundless \" and \" vexatious \" , but Hutchinson 's request for leave was granted . In May 1774 General Thomas Gage arrived in Boston to take over as governor , and to implement the \" Coercive Acts \" Parliament had passed as punishment for the tea party . Hutchinson , believing he would only be away from Massachusetts temporarily , sailed for England on 1 June 1774 . = = Exile = = Upon his arrival in London , Hutchinson was granted an audience with the king , who questioned him on affairs in North America , and he was well received by Rockingham , Dartmouth , and Lord North , the prime minister . In his interview with North he expressed dismay at the terms of the Massachusetts Government Act , and sought to establish a basis for the eventual repeal of the Boston Port Act , whose enactment by Governor Gage had a crippling effect on the province 's economy . One part of the Government Act , the appointment by the crown of the governor 's council , was something he had long opposed without formal hearings on the matter , but even colonial authorities sympathetic to his view believed events had by 1774 gone too far for the British political establishment to support alternatives . At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775 his Milton mansion was seized for use as an army barracks , and a trunk containing copies of much of his correspondence fell into rebel hands . As the war progressed , Hutchinson was criticised by the Whigs in Parliament , which he answered in an unpublished manuscript . He continued to be treated favourably by the king , but was compelled to refuse the offer of a baronetcy because most of his fortune was lost due to his exile , and became marginalised from power as prosecution of the war took center stage . On 4 July 1776 , Hutchinson was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Oxford University . His enemies in Massachusetts continued to attack his reputation , and his exile made it impossible to effectively dispute the charges they made . His properties , like those of other exiled Loyalists , were seized and sold off by the state ; his Milton home was eventually purchased by James and Mercy Otis Warren ( the latter being the sister of his long-time enemy James Otis , Jr . ) Bitter and disillusioned about his forced exile , and grieving the loss of his daughter Peggy in 1777 , Hutchinson continued to work on his history of the colony which was the fruit of many decades of research . Two volumes were published in his lifetime : Volume 1 of the History of Massachusetts appeared in 1764 , and Volume 2 in 1767 . The third volume would be published posthumously , and included his own tenure as lieutenant governor and governor . At the same time he worked to complete a history of the Hutchinson family , in which he encapsulated details on political affairs not found elsewhere . He suffered a stroke and died at Brompton , a part of London , on 3 June 1780 , aged 68 , and was buried at Croydon . = = Legacy and memory = = Because of his central role as the main focal point for the opposition to royal rule , Hutchinson 's reputation in America was generally quite poor . He was often seen as a traitor to his native Massachusetts and to the cause of freedom . John Adams was characteristically harsh in his assessment of him , calling him \" avaricious \" and describing him as a \" courtier \" who manipulated those at higher levels of power to achieve his aims . He was also criticized by British political figures : Thomas Pownall continued to disagree with Hutchinson after the latter 's exile , Francis Bernard ( despite working on Hutchinson 's behalf ) disapproved of some of his actions , and Lord North believed the publication of his letters to be responsible for the outbreak of the war . Biographers in the 20th century have , however , rehabilitated his reputation , seeking to explain how and why he came to be demonized in this way . In recent decades historians have typically portrayed Hutchinson as a tragic figure torn between his rulers in London and his people in Massachusetts . Barbara Tuchman , for example , portrays Hutchinson as an \" ill-fated \" and \" tragic figure . \" British scholar David Kenneth Fieldhouse says his tragedy emerged because he was \u201c a victim of the clash of two ideologies , his own archaic and static , that of his opponents contemporary and dynamic . \" Carl L. Becker , a prominent American historian wrote : \" Nothing would have pleased him [ Hutchinson ] more than that New England should have shown its emancipation from provincialism by meriting the good will of the King . His irritation with America in general and Boston in particular was the irritation of a proud and possessive father with a beloved but wayward child who fails to do him credit in high places . \" Bailyn has changed his own interpretation over the years . In the 1970s he saw Hutchinson as a bewildered pragmatist . By 2004 he portrayed Hutchinson as a premodern thinker locked in an old mindset at a time when Enlightenment ideas were taking hold thanks to thinkers such as Adam Smith and Tom Paine . Remnants of Hutchinson 's country estate in Milton have been preserved . The main piece , a parcel of land known as Governor Hutchinson 's Field , is owned by The Trustees of the Reservations , and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . It is open to the public , and a nearby property features a ha-ha constructed for Hutchinson in 1771 . The ha-ha is listed on the National Register of Historic Places , and both properties are part of the Milton Hill Historic District . Boston , which had landmarks named after the Hutchinson family , took pains upon his departure to rename them . = = Publications = = Hutchinson , Thomas ( 1764 ) .

I bought them to use on my new ceramic cook ware and they are GREAT! They do not scratch my cook ware, stove top or anything else. I'm not a fan of sponges, but I really like these. I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks. Normally, I'd have thrown it away by now, but, again, no odors and whatever I clean up comes right out of the sponge. I do use a liquid cleaner on these after use. I'd recommend these."
