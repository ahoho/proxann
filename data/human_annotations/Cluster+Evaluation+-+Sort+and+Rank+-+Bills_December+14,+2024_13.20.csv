They are absorbent, made well, clean up well and so far no odors. I bought them to use on my new ceramic cook ware and they are GREAT! They do not scratch my cook ware, stove top or anything else. I'm not a fan of sponges, but I really like these. I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks. Normally, I'd have thrown it away by now, but, again, no odors and whatever I clean up comes right out of the sponge. I do use a liquid cleaner on these after use. I'd recommend these.",,7
